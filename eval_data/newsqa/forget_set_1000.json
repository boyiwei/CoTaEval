{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 1 Serena Williams ' preparations for her Australian Open title defense suffered a late blip when she was beaten in the final of the Sydney International by Elena Dementieva on Friday . The American , who had struggled past unseeded Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai in three sets in the semifinals when she appeared to injure her left leg , lost 6-3 6-2 to suffer her fifth defeat in her last eight clashes with the Russian . `` I was struggling a little bit , but she definitely deserves all the credit , '' Williams told reporters . `` It 's definitely not ligament problems . It 's just a little pain but the strapping usually helps the pain go away . '' Dementieva , who beat world No. 2 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals , successfully defended her title in the final event before the first Grand Slam tournament of this decade starts on Monday . `` It 's great to play against the best players in the world , especially going into a Grand Slam . It was a great experience and it 'll help me next week at the Australian Open , '' she told the WTA Tour 's official Web site Dementieva went into the match against Williams having been handed a potential second-round clash with former world No. 1 Justine Henin , who pulled out of the Sydney event as a precaution after suffering a leg injury in her comeback tournament in Brisbane . Seven-time Grand Slam winner Henin , handed a wildcard after a 20-month retirement , will start against unseeded fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens on Monday while fifth seed Dementieva plays fellow Russian Vera Dushevina . Both have avoided the Williams sisters , who are in the top half of the draw with Serena opening against Poland 's Urszula Radwanska on Tuesday and sixth seed Venus taking on Czech Lucie Safarova . Four-time winner Serena could face seventh seed Victoria Azarenka in the last eight , with a possible semifinal against her older sibling looming . Last year 's losing finalist Safina opens against world No. 44 Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia , and could face fellow Russian Maria Sharapova in the fourth round . Sharapova , the 2008 champion but seeded 14th after struggling with shoulder problems last year , begins with a glamour clash against compatriot and fellow pin-up girl Maria Kirilenko . U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters could face fellow comeback queen Henin in the quarterfinals , having been seeded 15th and facing a qualifier first up . But to set up a rematch of the recent final in Brisbane , which she won , Clijsters is likely to have to overcome third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round . The Russian , who has never got past the last eight in Melbourne , takes on unseeded compatriot Anastasia Rodionova in her first match .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN Student News -RRB- -- On November 11 , Americans pay tribute to everyone who has served in the U.S. military . But why was this particular date chosen , and how does this holiday differ from Memorial Day ? Origins of Veterans Day World War I , also known as `` The Great War , '' was fought from 1914 to 1918 . During this conflict , Great Britain , France , Russia , Belgium , Italy , Japan , the United States and other countries , which formed the `` Allies , '' defeated the so-called `` Central Powers , '' which included Germany , Austria-Hungary , Turkey -LRB- then the Ottoman Empire -RRB- and Bulgaria . On the `` eleventh hour , of the eleventh day , of the eleventh month '' of 1918 , German leaders signed an armistice , or a halt to hostilities , with the Allied powers . On that date , November 11 , celebrations were held in New York City , Paris , London and in other cities around the globe . The following year , President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as `` Armistice Day , '' a day to observe the end of World War I. On June 4 , 1926 , the U.S. Congress passed a resolution asking President Calvin Coolidge to call upon officials to `` display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches , or other suitable places , with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples . '' Twelve years later , on May 13 , 1938 , Congress passed an Act making the 11th of November Armistice Day , a federal holiday . Initially , Armistice Day was supposed to honor veterans of World War I . But after the call to arms and human sacrifices during World War II and the Korean conflict , veterans ' groups urged Congress to consider a day to celebrate U.S. veterans of all wars . On June 1 , 1954 , President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day . Difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day Veterans Day in the United States is a day to honor all Americans who have served in the U.S. military , both during wartime and in peace . Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring Americans who have died serving the nation , especially those who died in battle or from wounds received during armed conflicts . On Veterans Day , Americans thank the living veterans for their service to the country and recognize all who have served the country . Veterans Day Proclamation The following is the text of President George W. Bush 's 2008 Veterans Day Proclamation : On Veterans Day , we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the United States . From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia , from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan , brave patriots have protected our Nation 's ideals , rescued millions from tyranny , and helped spread freedom around the globe . America 's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants , terrorists , and militaries the world has ever known . They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for freedom in human history . Members of the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marines , and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped secure America at every turn . Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and exemplary service . We also remember and honor those who laid down their lives in freedom 's defense . These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice for our benefit . On Veterans Day , we remember these heroes for their valor , their loyalty , and their dedication . Their selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom around the world . With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world , the Congress has provided -LRB- 5 U.S.C. 6103 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America 's veterans . NOW , THEREFORE , I , GEORGE W. BUSH , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim November 11 , 2008 , as Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15 , 2008 , as National Veterans Awareness Week . I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers . I call upon Federal , State , and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities in their communities . I invite civic and fraternal organizations , places of worship , schools , businesses , unions , and the media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions and programs . IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October , in the year of our Lord two thousand eight , and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third .

{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning Thursday for the Atlantic island of Bermuda as Category 3 Hurricane Bill neared . Hurricane Bill 's projected path shows it moving north toward New England and then Canada . The warning from the National Hurricane Center means tropical storm conditions , including winds of at least 39 mph -LRB- 63 kph -RRB- , are expected on the island within 24 hours . A hurricane watch was also in effect , meaning hurricane conditions , including winds of at least 74 mph -LRB- 119 kph -RRB- , are possible within 36 hours .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States are aiming to win the Solheim Cup for a fourth successive occasion when they face Europe in the 12th edition of the women 's team golf tournament , which begins at the Killeen Castle Golf Resort in Ireland on Friday . The competition , an exact replica of the men 's Ryder Cup , begins on Friday morning with four foursomes , where the players alternate playing the same ball , before the afternoon 's four fourballs -- which sees each player playing their own ball . Saturday 's two sessions then follow exactly the same format , before Sunday 's 12 individual singles , which will determine the winners . With a total of 28 points up for grabs , the winning team is the first to reach 14 1\/2 points , with the Americans securing 16-12 triumphs in Illinois in 2009 and Sweden in 2007 . Alison Nicholas , who is captaining Europe for a second time following their 2009 defeat , has paired Maria Hjorth and Anna Nordqvist in the opening foursomes match -- with the Swedish duo lining up against Michelle Wie and Cristie Kerr . The English duo of Karen Stupples and Melissa Reid face Paula Creamer and Brittany Lincicome in the second of the foursomes , while the third sees veteran Scot Catriona Matthew and Spanish rookie Azahara Munoz against Stacy Lewis and Angela Stanford . And Friday 's morning session is completed by Suzann Pettersen of Norway and Sweden 's Sophie Gustafson facing Brittany Lang and Juli Inkster -- who becomes the oldest-ever Solheim Cup player at the age of 51 . The United States lead Europe 8-3 overall and both Nicholas and her American counterpart Rosie Jones are aware of the need to get a good start in the competition . Nicholas told the official Solheim Cup website : `` I think I have a good blend in my team and I am very happy with the way the draw has worked out . `` Catriona , for instance , is a great leader and gets on so well with everyone . She has lots of experience and I think she will make a great pairing with Azahara . They are both steady players . '' The United States come into the match as favorites to retain their title , with four of the world 's top 10 amongst their ranks . `` I 've put Michelle and Cristie out first because they are both good leaders , '' Jones told the official website . `` They have played a lot together and had success . I want them to get out there and put up a point . '' She continued : `` I 've got heavy hitters in every match . I have a master plan and I 'm going to stick to it as much as possible .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Korea , whose leader Kim Jong Il died over the weekend , is the least democratic nation on Earth , according to a newly released report by a British analysis and intelligence firm . The Democracy Index 2011 , compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit , listed Norway as the most democratic nation in the world . The top 10 spots in this year 's index were occupied mostly by European countries . Following Norway were : Iceland , Denmark , Sweden , New Zealand , Australia , Switzerland , Canada , Finland and the Netherlands . Read the full report The United States ranked 19th , down two spots from the 2010 listing . The United States ' 2011 ranking is below Canada -LRB- 8th -RRB- and the United Kingdom -LRB- 18th -RRB- . The United States also ranked below the Czech Republic -LRB- 16th -RRB- , a former Soviet communist satellite that did not become a democracy until 1989 , and the South American nation of Uruguay -LRB- 17th -RRB- , a former right-wing dictatorship that did not return to democracy until 1984 . The Economist Intelligence Unit analysis , released this month , concluded that democracy deteriorated in 48 countries , improved in 41 and stayed the same in 78 . In most regions , the report said , the level of democracy was lower in 2011 than the previous year . `` 2011 was an exceptionally turbulent year , characterized by sovereign debt crises and weak political leadership in the developed world , dramatic political change and conflict in the Middle East and North Africa and rising social unrest , '' said Laza Kekic , the report 's lead author . The Democracy Index is based on five categories : electoral process and pluralism , civil liberties , how government functions , political participation by the public , and political culture . The analysts measured the level of democracy in 165 nations and two territories , `` which account for almost the entire population of the world , '' the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a release . Using a scale of 0 to 10 , countries were placed in one of four categories : full democracies -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- , flawed democracies -LRB- 6 to 7.9 -RRB- , hybrid regimes -LRB- 4 to 5.9 -RRB- and authoritarian regimes -LRB- 0 to 3.9 -RRB- . Norway , the top-ranked nation , had a score of 9.8 . The Scandinavian nation also ranked No. 1 in 2010 with an identical score . North Korea , ranked No. 167 , had a score of 1.08 . The Asian nation also ranked last in 2010 , with the same score . The United States had a score of 8.11 , slightly lower than last year 's 8.18 . `` U.S. democracy has been adversely affected by a deepening of the polarization of the political scene and political brinkmanship and paralysis , '' the Economist Intelligence Unit concluded . The analysts noted that the United States and the United Kingdom lag behind many other full democracies for some of the same reasons . `` There has been a rise in protest movements , '' the report states . `` Problems in the functioning of government have become more prominent . '' Among other findings in the report : -- Slightly more than half the world 's population lives in some type of democracy , although only 11 % enjoy a `` full democracy . '' -- More than one-third of the globe 's population lives under authoritarian rule . -- Nearly half the nations on the planet are considered democracies : 25 `` full '' and 53 `` flawed . '' -- There were 37 `` hybrid regimes '' and 52 `` authoritarian regimes . '' -- Violence , drug trafficking and other crime in Latin America continue to hinder democracy . -- Eastern Europe continued to suffer a decline in democracy , with 12 nations worse than the previous year . -- Western Europe also had a decline in democracy , with seven nations deteriorating and none improving . Some of that deterioration was due to financial problems plaguing the eurozone . Five of the countries that lost points in the rankings belong to the eurozone : Greece , Italy , Portugal , Spain and Ireland . -- Eight countries had a listing change from one type of government to another in 2011 . Four were upgraded and four were downgraded . -- Countries that deteriorated were : Portugal -LRB- fell from full to flawed democracy -RRB- , Ukraine and Guatemala -LRB- flawed democracy to hybrid regime -RRB- and Russia -LRB- hybrid to authoritarian regime -RRB- . -- Zambia improved from a hybrid to a flawed democracy . Tunisia , Mauritania and Niger moved up from authoritarian to hybrid . In the Western Hemisphere , Costa Rica is ranked 20th , up five spots from last year .

The Economist Intelligence Unit , which performed the analysis , is based in London and reports having offices in more than 40 cities worldwide . The company says it has about 650 country experts and analysts worldwide . The Democracy Index 2011 was released December 15 . The latest Democracy Index closely mirrors a Corruption Perceptions Index released by the German watchdog organization Transparency International in late November . In that analysis , New Zealand was perceived as the least corrupt nation on earth , and Somalia and North Korea were seen as the most corrupt . The United States ranked 24th least corrupt on a `` corruption perceptions index , '' the fourth-best in the Western Hemisphere . Canada ranked 10th , the Bahamas was 21st and Chile was 22nd . Overall , the top spots were occupied mostly by European countries , with the exception of New Zealand , Singapore at No. 5 and Australia , which was tied for eighth with Switzerland . Other nations with top rankings were Denmark , Finland , Sweden , Norway and the Netherlands . In addition to Somalia and North Korea , which were tied for last at No. 182 , the bottom of the list included Myanmar , Afghanistan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Sudan , Iraq , Haiti and Venezuela . The report was prepared by the independent , nonpartisan Transparency International organization , which said it drew its conclusions based `` on different assessments and business opinion surveys carried out by independent and reputable institutions . '' The information used to compile the index included `` questions relating to the bribery of public officials , kickbacks in public procurement , embezzlement of public funds and questions that probe the strength and effectiveness of public-sector and anti-corruption efforts , '' Transparency International said . Perceptions are used , the organization said , because corruption is a hidden activity that is difficult to measure . `` Over time , '' the organization said in its report , `` perceptions have proved to be a reliable estimate of corruption . '' The rankings for other Western Hemisphere countries were : Uruguay -LRB- 25 -RRB- , Puerto Rico -LRB- 39 -RRB- , Costa Rica -LRB- 50 -RRB- , Cuba -LRB- 61 -RRB- , Brazil -LRB- 73 -RRB- , Colombia , El Salvador and Peru -LRB- tied for 80 -RRB- , Panama -LRB- 86 -RRB- , Argentina and Mexico -LRB- tied for 100 -RRB- , Bolivia -LRB- 118 -RRB- , Ecuador and Guatemala -LRB- tied for 120 -RRB- , the Dominican Republic and Honduras -LRB- tied for 129 -RRB- , Nicaragua -LRB- 134 -RRB- , Paraguay -LRB- 154 -RRB- , Venezuela -LRB- 172 -RRB- and Haiti -LRB- 175 -RRB- . The index used a scale of 0-10 to measure perceived corruption , with zero representing highly corrupt and 10 being very clean . New Zealand , the highest-ranked nation , has a 9.5 score . Somalia and North Korea , the lowest-ranked , had 1.0 . The United States scored 7.1 , while Canada was 8.7 and Chile was 7.2 . Haiti , the lowest-ranked nation in the Western Hemisphere , scored 1.8 . Next-worst was Venezuela with 1.9 . Transparency International , headquartered in Berlin , reports having 90 chapters worldwide . The organization says it works with partners in government , business and civil society to develop and implement effective measures to combat corruption .","question":""}
{"answer":"BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Officials on Monday announced the death of a second child who consumed contaminated milk powder . More than 1,200 others have been sickened , according to China 's Health Ministry . Of that number , 340 infants are hospitalized and 53 are considered to be in serious condition . Government inspectors are testing baby formula around China and plan to release their results on Tuesday , said Li Changjiang , head of the State Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine , according to the Xinhua news agency . The manufacturer , Sanlu Group , has recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of babies developing kidney stones , Xinhua said . Watch what Sanlu has done '' Sanlu , one of China 's leading dairy producers , has also sealed off more than 2,100 tons of contaminated product , and another 700 tons still need to be recalled , the news agency said . It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder , according to China Daily . In 2004 , at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition . The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand , according to the paper . More than 170 other babies were hospitalized as a result of drinking the cheap milk powder . Chinese police have questioned 78 people -- including dairy farmers and milk dealers -- about the most recent contamination , a Chinese official told Xinhua Saturday . Sanlu would not say whether its employees are being investigated , Xinhua said . Testing by Sanlu found tripolycyanamide , also known as melamine , in 700 tons of its product , said Zhao Xinchao , the vice mayor of Shijiazhuang , the news agency reported . Zhao told the news agency that the suspects added water to the milk they sold to Sanlu to make more money , then added the chemical so the diluted milk could still meet standards . Inspectors found the chemical in Sanlu infant formula produced by one of the company 's partner producers in northwest Gansu Province , an official said Sunday . Two of 12 samples randomly selected from the Sanlu milk powder produced by the Haoniu Dairy Company in Jiuquan City tested positive for melamine , said Xian Hui , the vice-governor of Gansu . Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones , urinary tract ulcers , and eye and skin irritation . The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants . Hundreds of Wal-Mart and Carrefour stores in China are pulling the Sanlu milk powder from their shelves , Xinhua said . This episode marks the latest in a string of tainted products produced in China . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled more than 150 brands of cat and dog food last year after finding that some pets became ill or died after eating food tainted with melamine , the same chemical found in the powdered milk . Two Chinese businesses , a U.S. company and top executives of each were indicted by a federal grand jury in February in connection with tainted pet food , which resulted in deaths and serious illnesses in up to thousands of U.S. pets , federal prosecutors said . In October 2007 , regulators and retailers in the United States recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . In November , shipments of the popular toy Aqua Dots were found to have been contaminated with a toxic chemical that turned into a powerful `` date rape '' drug if swallowed , causing some children who ate the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness . And in February , a Maryland candy distributor pulled Pokemon-brand Valentine lollipops from store shelves after bits of metal were found in the sealed treats , authorities said . Officials on Monday announced the death of a second child who consumed contaminated milk powder . Of the more than 1,200 others who have been sickened , 340 infants were hospitalized , and 53 considered to be in serious condition , according to China 's Health Ministry .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a second vaccine intended to protect against cervical cancer . GlaxoSmithKline has manufactured a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer . Cervarix , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline , was approved Friday for prevention of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus -LRB- HPV -RRB- types 16 and 18 . The vaccine is approved for use in girls and women ages 10 to 25 years and is to be administered in three doses . After the initial shot , the second and third doses are to be given within six months . `` The licensure of Cervarix adds another option in the prevention of cervical cancer , '' said Dr. Karen Midthun , acting director of the FDA 's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research . `` It has the potential to save lives from cervical cancer as well as reduce the need for biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the necessary follow-up from abnormal Pap tests . '' According to GlaxoSmithKline , the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions , regardless of HPV type . `` The vaccine contains two HPV types -LRB- 16 & 18 -RRB- responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in North America , '' said Sarah Alspach , a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman . `` But approximately 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by other cancer-causing HPV types . Cervarix has been shown to reduce the incidence of pre-cancers resulting from cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18 . '' The vaccine will be available this year , according to GSK , which did not divulge the price . Cervarix will be competing with Merck & Company 's Gardasil , the first cervical cancer vaccine , which won FDA approval in June 2006 . Gardasil , for girls and women ages 9 to 26 , prevents against cervical , vulvar and vaginal cancers and protects against HPV types 11 , 16 and 18 . Gardasil 's approval has been broadened by the FDA to include an indication for boys and young men ages 9 through 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11 . `` This vaccine is the first preventive therapy against genital warts in boys and men ages 9 through 26 , and , as a result , fewer men will need to undergo treatment for genital warts . '' Midthun said . According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention , HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the nation . More than 40 types of HPV can infect genital areas , according to the disease agency . But because many of them are not visible to the naked eye , most people who become infected do n't know it .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Veteran goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt has received his first international call-up since 2003 as Germany coach Joachim Low named seven players from Bayern Munich in a preliminary 27-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa . The 35-year-old Butt will be competing for a starting place with Schalke 's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen 's Tim Wiese as Bayer Leverkusen 's Rene Adler has been ruled out with a rib injury . Captain Michael Ballack , who plays for English club Chelsea , is the only man selected who does not feature in the German Bundesliga . Stuttgart 's Brazil-born forward Cacau is included , but his former clubmate Thomas Hitzlsperger misses out despite the absence of injured Leverkusen midfielder Simon Rolfes as he has not been playing regularly for his Italian club Lazio . `` This was a very difficult decision for me , '' Low told reporters on Thursday . `` Thomas has never disappointed us and made a key contribution in helping us qualify . `` He is a reliable player , but he barely played in the last few months before he left Stuttgart and has also played very little at Lazio . '' Low will reduce the squad to 23 by the June 1 deadline for submission ahead of the tournament 's kick-off 10 days later . Butt , who has won three caps , will not be able to feature in next Thursday 's friendly against Malta as he will be needed by Bayern in the German Cup final against Bremen in Berlin on May 15 . His clubmates Holger Badstuber , Mario Gomez , Miroslav Klose , Philipp Lahm , Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger will also sit out the Malta game in Aachen along with Bremen 's Wiese , Per Mertesacker , Marko Marin and Mesut Ozil . The 21-year-old Badstuber has yet to win a cap for Germany and made his senior debut for Bayern in the first game of this season , covering at left-back despite being a central defender . Attacking midfielder Muller , 20 , will seek to add to his sole cap after also impressing this season , scoring the first hat-trick of his career in the 3-1 win over Bochum last weekend which effectively gave Bayern the league title . Ballack will also be away playing for Chelsea in the FA Cup final on May 15 , before joining the squad in Sicily with the Werder quartet , while the Bayern players will not be in camp until after the Champions League final on May 22 . Bayern , who had eight players in the squad that finished third on home soil four years ago , can complete the first leg of a potential treble by clinching the Bundesliga title this weekend , when Louis Van Gaal 's side face bottom club Hertha Berlin . Germany will face Hungary in Budapest on May 29 and then Bosnia-Herzegovina in Frankfurt on June 3 before heading to South Africa .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -- France coach Raymond Domenech has again omitted striker David Trezeguet from his squad for this month 's friendly against Morocco and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ukraine . Happier times : David Trezeguet celebrates after scoring for Juventus against Torino . Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party . The 29-year-old , who last played for France in the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in September , was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands . He played no part as Domenech 's team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month . The coach said : `` David is having a great start to the season with Juventus , but he 's in competition for a place . If we qualify , the Euro 2008 will be in eight months . A lot of things can happen in between . `` I hope David will help Juventus win the Italian league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us , and that he will find his form again for France . '' Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa , who made his debut as a substitute against the Faroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory . Ben Arfa is joined in the squad by club-mate Karim Benzema , while Bolton 's Nicholas Anelka is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury . Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury , but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway . `` A player of Patrick 's dimension is going to be missed , but we just have to accept it and get on with it . Pat should be coming to see us because he 's a leader , and he 's the captain , '' Domenech added . France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21 . Domenech 's team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17 . If the Glasgow game ends in a draw , France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket .

{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tropical Storm Arthur , the first named storm of the 2008 Atlantic season , formed Saturday near the coast of Belize , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said . Tropical Storm Arthur could make its way across the Yucatan and re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico . The storm made its way over land and was expected to weaken , but the center said the storm could re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico and regain intensity Sunday . At 11 p.m. , the center of Arthur was over the southern Yucatan Peninsula , about 80 miles -LRB- 125 km -RRB- west of Chetumal , Mexico , and about 120 miles -LRB- 195 km -RRB- south-southeast of Campeche , Mexico . It was moving west at about 7 miles -LRB- 11 km -RRB- per hour . The storm 's maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph -LRB- 65 km\/hr -RRB- , with higher gusts , mainly over water east of its center . Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 260 miles -LRB- 415 km -RRB- from the center of the storm , forecasters said . The government of Belize issued a tropical storm warning for the nation 's coast , and the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Catoche south to the border with Belize . A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area -- in this case , within the next six to 12 hours . The storm was forecast to dump up to 10 inches of rain over Belize , up to 15 inches in isolated areas , the hurricane center said . The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season begins Sunday . On Thursday , Tropical Storm Alma , the first one of the year in the eastern Pacific , formed near the west coast of Central America , according to the National Weather Service . The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over the high terrain of Central America . The federal government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted this month that the Atlantic season would be more active than normal , with up to 16 named storms and up to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or above . The noted Colorado State University hurricane forecasting team predicted this year that there would be 15 named storms , eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes . The team calculated a 69 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. coast . A survey released this week found that 50 percent of 1,100 adults surveyed in Atlantic and U.S. Gulf Coast states did not have disaster plans or survival kits . `` Nearly one in three said they would not prepare their home until a storm is within 24 hours of landfall , '' Bill Read , director of the National Hurricane Center , said Thursday . `` Now is the time to buy all that stuff , '' he said upon the release of the survey by polling firm Mason-Dixon .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama reached out to Iran on Friday -- the start of the Iranian New Year -- in a video message offering `` the promise of a new beginning '' that is `` grounded in mutual respect . '' Obama 's message to Iran echoes his inaugural speech , where he said `` we seek a new way forward . '' The message is a dramatic shift in tone from that of the Bush administration , which included Iran , along with North Korea and Iraq , in an `` axis of evil . '' It also echoes Obama 's inaugural speech , in which he said to the Muslim world , `` we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . '' In Friday 's video , Obama said : `` The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . You have that right , but it comes with real responsibilities . And that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the Iranian people and civilization . '' There was no immediate response from Tehran to Obama 's message , but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month that his country would welcome talks with the United States `` in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect . '' The United States , several European nations and Israel suspect that Tehran has been trying to acquire the capacity to build nuclear weapons , but Iran says its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes . Last month , the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report saying that Iran has reached `` nuclear weapons breakout capability '' -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb . The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency . However , an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data , saying Iran 's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material . That has n't been done , the official said . The United States has had tortuous relations with Tehran since the Islamic revolution in 1979 , but the Obama message speaks of `` new beginnings '' with the promise of a new year . `` We have serious differences that have grown over time . My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States , Iran and the international community , '' the president said . `` This process will not be advanced by threats . We seek , instead , engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect . ''","question":""}

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a lifetime of playing characters past-their-prime , Clint Eastwood appears to still be enjoying his own . Clint Eastwood stars as inspector Harry Callahan in `` Dirty Harry '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- . Just last week the 78-year-old actor , best-known for his portrayal of `` tough guys '' like `` Dirty Harry , '' was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival . The American film-maker accepted the Palme d'Or -LRB- only the second they 've ever given for lifetime achievement -RRB- , while he was in town promoting his new film `` Gran Torino . '' What is your favorite Clint Eastwood movie ? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . Eastwood both directs and co-stars in `` Gran Torino , '' as a prejudiced Korean war veteran who comes to the rescue of troubled Asian teens who live next door . For Eastwood the honor caps a 40 year career acting , directing , producing and composing . During this time , he has won five Academy Awards , five Golden Globes and received many more nominations . The Hollywood veteran earned perhaps most acclaim for two films : `` Unforgiven '' -LRB- 1992 -RRB- and `` Million Dollar Baby '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . For each of these films he was awarded both Best Director and Best Picture Oscars , as well as being nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role . Eastwood got his break in 1959 , landing the role of Rowdy Yates in the television series `` Rawhide . '' A successful seven-year run helped turn Eastwood into a household name and landed him several other roles in so-called Spaghetti Western films , including the hit `` A Fist Full of Dollars '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , directed by Sergio Leone . Leone then re-hired Eastwood for two more successful films : `` For a Few More Dollars '' -LRB- 1965 -RRB- and `` The Good , the Bad and the Ugly '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . The trilogy earned Eastwood greater fame and a reputation for playing tough-guy , gun-slinging cowboys . Eastwood found another friend in director Don Siegel who gave him perhaps his most iconic role , starring in `` Dirty Harry '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- as no-nonsense , `` loose-cannon '' cop Harry Callahan . The film was such a hit that it four spin off sequels were made : `` Magnum Force '' -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , `` The Enforcer '' -LRB- 1976 -RRB- , `` Sudden Impact '' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- -LRB- the highest grossing film of the series -RRB- , and `` The Dead Pool '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- . In the 1990s Eastwood returned to westerns -- this time as director as well as star -- earning critical acclaim and a monumental nine Oscar nominations for `` Unforgiven '' -LRB- 1992 -RRB- . Throughout the decade he also had considerable success helming blockbuster projects , like `` In the Line of Fire '' -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , `` Bridges of Madison County '' -LRB- 1995 -RRB- and `` True Crime '' -LRB- 1999 -RRB- . In 2000 Eastwood co-starred in the box-office hit `` Space Cowboys . '' In 2004 , he put employed his entire array of movie skills directing , producing , scoring and co-starring alongside Hillary Swank in boxing drama `` Million Dollar Baby . '' Until his most recent return to the screen in `` Gran Torino , '' Eastwood had been concentrating on directing , releasing two films about World War II in 2006 , `` Flags of our Fathers '' and `` Letters from Iwo Jima '' and directing Angelina Jolie to BAFTA , Golden Globe and Oscar nominations this year in `` Changeling . '' Swedish director Ingmar Bergman is the only other film-maker to have received the Palme d'Or for lifetime achievement from the Cannes Film Festival .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Mad Men '' and `` Damages '' found themselves on top when the nominations for the 60th Annual Primetime Emmys came out Thursday morning -- but , again , there was no love for HBO 's `` The Wire . '' Emmy nominee Jon Hamm stars as ad exec Don Draper in `` Mad Men , '' which earned 16 nominations . AMC 's `` Mad Men '' and FX 's `` Damages '' made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama . The pair , which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist , have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though `` Damages '' star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show 's audience . `` We need all the help we can get , '' she told The Associated Press . On the other hand , HBO 's `` The Wire '' -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations . It did receive one nod , for writing . The series , though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans , has received little recognition from the Emmys , with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005 . Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year '' Indeed , HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded `` The Sopranos , '' which won best drama last year after a storied run . `` Mad Men , '' which has made AMC into a player , was allegedly turned down by the cable giant , and shows such as the quickly canceled `` John From Cincinnati '' and `` Rome '' have n't had the same impact . On the other hand , `` In Treatment '' received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne 's performance as a therapist , and the network 's comedies , particularly `` Entourage , '' have performed strongly . Moreover , the network 's short-form programming , such as the miniseries `` John Adams '' and the TV movie `` Recount , '' dominated their Emmy categories : `` John Adams '' led all nominees with 23 nominations , and `` Recount , '' about the 2000 presidential election battle , received 11 . `` The network has made up for -LSB- its lack of drama series success -RSB- in other forms , '' Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN . `` It 's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program . '' HBO led all networks with 85 nominations . Among broadcast networks , ABC led with 76 nominations . Among regularly scheduled TV series , `` 30 Rock '' earned 17 nominations and `` Mad Men '' received 16 . The 17 nominations for `` 30 Rock '' were a record number in a single year for a comedy series . Newcomer `` Pushing Daisies , '' the whimsical series on ABC , received 12 nominations . Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and has n't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise , Schneider said . `` It was nice that voters still remembered it , '' he said . Along with `` Damages '' and `` Mad Men , '' nominees for best drama include `` Boston Legal , '' `` Dexter , '' `` House '' and `` Lost . '' Comedy series nominees are `` Curb Your Enthusiasm , '' `` Entourage , '' `` The Office , '' `` 30 Rock '' and `` Two and a Half Men . '' Cable series dominated the dramatic acting nominations , with four of the six actors and three of the five actresses appearing on basic or pay cable . Best actor in a drama nominees are Byrne -LRB- `` In Treatment '' -RRB- , Bryan Cranston -LRB- `` Breaking Bad '' -RRB- , Michael C. Hall -LRB- `` Dexter '' -RRB- , Jon Hamm -LRB- `` Mad Men '' -RRB- , Hugh Laurie -LRB- `` House '' -RRB- and James Spader -LRB- `` Boston Legal '' -RRB- . `` Dexter , '' which originated on Showtime , earned a short run on CBS following the writers strike .

Sarah Silverman earned three nominations , all for different programs : one for a guest shot on `` Monk , '' another for contributing to `` Jimmy Kimmel Live '' and a third for producing her own `` The Sarah Silverman Program . '' Kristin Chenoweth , Neil Patrick Harris and TV academy Chairman John Shaffner announced the nominations Thursday . Chenoweth was particularly bubbly , throwing in a non sequitur about once dating `` Survivor '' host Jeff Probst and declining to sing `` Happy Birthday '' because `` the Emmys ca n't afford me to sing that song '' due to licensing arrangements . Both Chenoweth -LRB- `` Pushing Daisies '' -RRB- and Harris -LRB- `` How I Met Your Mother '' -RRB- were nominated in supporting actor categories . Two highly rated shows , `` Grey 's Anatomy '' and `` Desperate Housewives , '' were snubbed . `` Grey 's , '' a regular nominee for best drama , was left off that list , though star Sandra Oh was nominated for best supporting actress . `` Housewives , '' which won six Emmys its debut season , was ignored in both best comedy series and best actress in a comedy series categories . Two guest stars did receive nominations . Stephen Colbert , nominated for individual performance in a variety or musical program , put everything in perspective . `` What an honor , unless I do n't win , '' he told the AP .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hydroxycut products , popular dietary supplements used for weight loss , have been linked to liver damage and are being recalled , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday . The FDA has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries , including a death , linked to Hydroxycut products . The FDA said it has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries linked to Hydroxycut products , which are also used as energy enhancers and as fat burners . The reports include the 2007 death of a 19-year-old man living in the Southwest , which was reported to the FDA in March . Other serious liver problems reported included liver damage that resulted in a transplant in 2002 , liver failure , jaundice , seizures and cardiovascular problems . The FDA is warning consumers to immediately stop using 14 Hydroxycut products manufactured by Iovate Health Sciences Inc. of Oakville , Ontario , and distributed by Iovate Health Sciences USA Inc. of Blasdell , New York . The company is voluntarily recalling the following products : Hydroxycut Regular Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Max Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Regular Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Drink Packets -LRB- Ignition Stix -RRB- , Hydroxycut Max Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Liquid Shots , Hydroxycut Hardcore RTDs -LRB- Ready-to-Drink -RRB- , Hydroxycut Max Aqua Shed , Hydroxycut 24 , Hydroxycut Carb Control and Hydroxycut Natural . Watch more on the FDA 's concern '' According to the FDA , last year , Iovate sold more than 9 million units of Hydroxycut products , which were distributed widely to grocery stores , health food stores and pharmacies . `` The FDA urges consumers to discontinue use of Hydroxycut products in order to avoid any undue risks . Adverse events are rare , but exist . Consumers should consult a physician or other health care professional if they experience symptoms possibly associated with these products , '' said Dr. Linda Katz , interim chief medical officer of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition . Liver damage is rare , but patients who experienced problems were taking doses recommended on the product label , the FDA said . Symptoms include brown urine , nausea , vomiting , fatigue , stomach pain , itching and light-colored stools . The FDA has not determined what specific ingredients are responsible for the problems , because the products contain a variety of overlapping ingredients and herbal extracts . Dietary supplements sold before October 1994 are not required to undergo any FDA review before going to market . The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 required manufacturers to ensure a supplement to be safe before marketing . But manufacturers still do n't need to register a product with the FDA or get approval before selling a supplement . The agency can take action against an unsafe supplement once it 's on the market . Since December 2007 , any serious adverse event reported to the manufacturer must now be reported to the FDA within 15 days . The Council for Responsible Nutrition , the leading trade association representing the dietary supplement industry , said that both the FDA and Iovate `` took appropriate action today .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Latino voters strongly support President Barack Obama and his Democratic Party , despite dissatisfaction with the administration 's deportation policies , according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center . The results are good news for Obama and Democrats for next year 's election , as Hispanics are the fastest-growing population group in the country and comprise a major voting bloc . According to the survey , Latino registered voters favor Obama over Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney or Texas Gov. Rick Perry by margin of more than 2-to-1 . The results are similar to the presidential election in 2008 , when Obama got 67 % of the Latino vote compared with 31 % for Republican candidate Sen. John McCain . Hispanic voters have traditionally identified with the Democratic Party , and the Pew survey 's results showed that connection continues . It said two-thirds of Hispanic registered voters identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party , while 20 % felt that way about the Republican Party . `` It is interesting that among Latino voters , the voters who are registered , there is a lot of support for the Democrats , but also for Barack Obama , '' Mark Hugo Lopez , executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center , said in an interview with CNN . The survey of 1,200 Hispanic adults was conducted in English and Spanish from November 9 through December 7 , and has a margin of error of 3.6 % . While showing strong Latino support for Obama and Democrats , the survey also showed Hispanics dislike immigration policies of the Obama administration , which increased deportations to 395,000 in 2009 and 387,000 in 2010 . According to the Pew survey , 59 % of Latino respondents disapproved of the administration 's handling of deportations , while 27 % approved . At the same time , the survey found that less than half of the Hispanic respondents -- 41 % -- knew that more deportations were occurring under the Obama administration than the Bush administration that preceded it . A strong majority -- 77 % -- of Latino respondents who were aware of the increased deportations under Obama disapproved of his administration 's policy , while just over half of those unaware of the increase also expressed disapproval . Hispanics accounted for 97 % of deportees in 2010 , according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Americans and an Israeli were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for painstakingly mapping out the thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome -- work that paves the way for new antibiotics . U.S. researcher Thomas Steitz is one of three scientists sharing the 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry . Inside all animals , plants and bacteria are DNA molecules that contain the blueprint for life . Ribosomes are an organism 's protein factories . They use the information in the DNA to make the tens of thousands of proteins that enable the organism to function properly . These proteins include hormones , enzymes and hemoglobin , which transports oxygen . From a medicinal standpoint , the ribosome is important because it is what antibiotics target . In a bacterial strain , antibiotics bind to the ribosomes , preventing them from making the proteins the bacteria need to survive . Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz and Israeli Ada Yonath shared the $ 1.4 million prize for mapping the position of the thousands and thousands of atoms that make up ribosomes . Their three-dimensional models showed how different antibiotics bind to the ribosome . `` These models are now used by scientists in order to develop new antibiotics , directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering , '' said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which awards the prize . Ramakrishnan , a U.S. citizen who was born in India , is a senior scientist and group leader at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , England , according to the Nobel Prize Web site .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that infants born as a result of assisted reproductive technology , or ART -- such as in vitro fertilization and the use of donor eggs -- are two to four times more likely to be born with certain types of birth defects than infants conceived naturally . But , the study 's lead author says , the overall risk is still relatively low . With any pregnancy , there is a 3 percent risk of having a baby with a birth defect . `` The most important findings were that for infants conceived using ART , we see an increased risk for certain birth defects , '' said Jennita Reefhuis , Ph.D. , an epidemiologist at the CDC 's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities . She says that children conceived using ART were found to have twice the risk of septal heart defects -LRB- a `` hole '' in the heart -RRB- , more than twice the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate , and four times the risk of two gastrointestinal defects . As part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study , which gathers information on birth defects from 10 states , Reefhuis and her colleagues compared 281 births using ART with more than 14,000 naturally conceived births . The researchers looked at approximately 18 categories of birth defects , but only those four were found to be `` statistically significantly associated with ART . '' The study findings pertain only to single births ; the researchers did not find a link between ART and birth defects among multiple births . ART increases the chances of having a multiple birth , and infants born as part of a multiple birth are more likely to have birth defects regardless of the method of conception . `` It is important for parents to realize that the individual risk for these birth defects remain low , '' Reefhuis said . `` It sounds like a lot to say ' a two - to fourfold increased risk , ' but you have to keep in mind that the starting risk for these individual defects is actually pretty low . '' Still , says Reefhuis , in the interest of full disclosure and because the use of ART is on the rise , it is important to make these higher risks known . `` I think it 's important for people to be aware that there may be an increased risk for birth defects with ART , '' she said . `` But it is also really important for couples to realize that with any pregnancy , there is a 3 percent risk of a birth defect regardless of any exposures during pregnancy . '' Elizabeth Ginsburg , M.D. , president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the medical director of in vitro fertilization at Brigham and Women 's hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , says the study adds to a growing body of evidence . Ginsburg is not connected to the CDC study . `` I think the take-home message is that if you have infertility and you are going to get help to try to conceive , there is some evidence that you might be at increased risk of having a baby with problems , '' Ginsburg said . `` The big question it raises is , is there something biologically different about people with infertility , '' Ginsburg said . `` It would n't be shocking to find out that there may be some biological difference that makes it more difficult for them to conceive as well as putting them at risk of a higher chance of having babies with some sort of adverse outcome . '' ART , which has been used in the United States since 1981 , is defined as any procedure that involves surgically removing eggs from a woman 's ovaries , combining them with sperm in the laboratory , and returning them to the woman 's body or donating them to another woman . It does not include intrauterine -- or artificial -- insemination or egg-stimulating drugs such as Clomid . It is estimated that more than 1 percent of babies born in the United States are conceived using ART , and that number has been steadily rising , with the rate doubling between 1996 and 2004 . In 2005 , 134,000 ART procedures were performed , resulting in approximately 52,000 births . Almost 12 percent of women ages 15 to 44 report having used some kind of infertility treatment , according to a 2002 national survey .","question":""}

{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pop singer Ricky Martin declared publicly this week what he avoided discussing for years : He is gay . `` I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man , '' Martin wrote on his official Web site . `` I am very blessed to be who I am . '' A decade ago , when ABC 's Barbara Walters pressed Martin to address rumors about his sexuality , he declined to confirm or deny them . `` I just do n't feel like it , '' Martin said . Now , Martin wrote , `` these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I did n't even know existed . '' The 39-year-old Puerto Rican native started off with the Latin boy band Menudo before launching his solo career in 1991 . His song `` Livin ' La Vida Loca '' rose to the top of the music charts in 1999 and propelled Martin to stardom . Martin said he decided years ago to not share `` my entire truth '' with the world because people he loved warned him that `` everything you 've built will collapse . '' `` Allowing myself to be seduced by fear and insecurity became a self-fulfilling prophecy of sabotage , '' he wrote . `` Today I take full responsibility for my decisions and my actions . '' The decision to come out was initiated a few months ago , when he began writing his memoirs , he said . `` I got very close to my truth , '' he wrote . `` From the moment I wrote the first phrase I was sure the book was the tool that was going to help me free myself from things I was carrying within me for a long time , '' he wrote . `` Things that were too heavy for me to keep inside .

This has to change . This was not supposed to happen five or 10 years ago , it is supposed to happen now . Today is my day , this is my time , and this is my moment .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress pleaded guilty Thursday to a weapons charge stemming from a shooting incident at a nightclub last year , the Manhattan district attorney said . Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress will serve two years in prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges . Burress , 32 , pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and will serve two years in prison , according to Alicia Maxey Greene , spokeswoman for district attorney Robert M. Morgenthau 's office . Two years of supervised release will follow his jail term , she said . Burress is free on bail and will be sentenced September 22 . A grand jury indicted the former New York Giants football player earlier this month on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and a single count of reckless endangerment in the second degree . He pleaded not guilty to those charges earlier this year . Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg November 29 , 2008 , with a .40 - caliber semi-automatic pistol he was carrying in the waistband of his jeans . The incident occurred in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan . A teammate who was with Burress , linebacker Antonio Pierce , drove him to a hospital and arranged to have the pistol delivered to Burress ' New Jersey home , according to an August 3 statement from the district attorney 's office . The district attorney also sought charges against Pierce , but the grand jury did not indict him . Burress was not licensed to carry a pistol in either New York or New Jersey . No one , including employees of the New York Presbyterian Hospital and the NFL , called the police to report the gunshot wound , as required by law . One of the hospital workers was suspended after the incident . Burress became a hero to New York Giants fans in the 2008 Super Bowl when he caught the game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning with 35 seconds remaining in the game . In the following year , however , Burress ' career with the Giants was marred by a series of incidents in addition to the shooting . He was suspended from the team in early October for missing a practice , and later that month the NFL fined him $ 45,000 after he argued with a referee and threw a football into the stands during a game . Burress was suspended from the Giants immediately after the shooting incident . The team released him in April . CNN 's Chloe Melas contributed to this report","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Only one-quarter of Americans think the federal stimulus plan has helped the middle class , while a majority say it has helped bankers and investors , according to a new national poll . A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning indicates that 25 percent of the public thinks the stimulus has benefited the middle class . One-third of the people questioned think the stimulus has helped low-income Americans , with just over four in 10 saying the plan has benefited business executives . A majority , 54 percent , think the stimulus has helped bankers and investors . `` Opinions on the economic stimulus bill are colored by the perception that it has helped fat cats , but not ordinary Americans , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` It 's possible that the belief that the stimulus bill helped bankers and CEOs is due to the public confusing the stimulus bill with the various bailout bills that were passed at roughly the same time last year . '' The survey also indicates that one-quarter think the stimulus has helped people in their own community , with three in 10 saying it has hurt people in their community and 45 percent saying the plan has had no effect . According to a CNN poll released Sunday , 56 percent of the public opposes the stimulus , with 42 percent supportive of the plan . Last March , just weeks after President Obama signed the stimulus bill into law , a CNN survey indicated that 54 percent supported the program , with 44 percent opposed . The program , formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , attempts to stimulate the country 's economy by increasing federal spending and cutting taxes , at a total cost to the government of $ 862 billion . No Republicans in the House of Representatives and only three in the Senate voted for the bill . The stimulus was initially thought to have a price tag of $ 787 billion , but the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday increased its forecast for how much the stimulus will add to the nation 's deficit , raising its estimate by $ 75 billion .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What recession ? Christie 's , the famed auction house , this week sold a nearly 36-carat diamond for $ 24.3 million , which it said was the highest price for a diamond sold at auction . The 35.56-carat diamond dates back to the 17th century . The previous record was a mere $ 16.5 million for a 100-carat diamond in 1995 , Christie 's said . `` In the midst of these challenging times , we were thrilled to achieve an historic price for an historic diamond , '' said Francois Curiel , chairman of Christie 's Europe and auctioneer for Wednesday 's sale . The 35.56-carat Wittelsbach blue diamond , dating to the 17th century , was purchased by international jeweler Laurence Graff , the auction house said in a release . Graff was bidding against Aleks Paul of Essex Global Trading , a professional of Russian origin based in New York , Christie 's said . `` Known as ` Der Blaue Wittelsbacher ' since 1722 , it is one of very few diamonds which can claim 17th century heritage , incredible rarity and exceptional beauty . '' The diamond , mined in India nearly 400 years ago , has been privately owned since 1964 . Until 1723 , Christie 's said , all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India . The diamond has a royal lineage . Christie 's traces it thus : King Philip IV of Spain -LRB- 1605-1665 -RRB- selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter , the Infanta Margarita Teresa -LRB- 1651-1673 -RRB- . She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria -LRB- 1640-1705 -RRB- , who later became Holy Roman Emperor . When she died in 1673 , her husband retained the diamond , which was passed on to his heirs . In 1722 , the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria -LRB- 1701-1756 -RRB- married the Bavarian Crown Prince , Charles Albert -LRB- 1697-1745 -RRB- . It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III -LRB- 1845-1921 -RRB- in 1918 . The world 's largest deep blue diamond is the `` Hope Diamond , '' a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . Diamonds apparently are recession-proof . Christie 's reported jewelry sales of $ 226 million for the first half of 2008 , calling it `` the best jewelry season ever seen at auction . '' Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007 , Christie 's said . According to Christie 's , key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $ 8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond , which sold for $ 7.1 million on June 11 in London .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Although it did n't set a franchise record , `` The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 '' had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $ 139.5 million , according to studio estimates . That 's the fifth-best opening weekend ever , behind `` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 , '' `` The Dark Knight , '' `` Spider-Man 3 , '' and `` The Twilight Saga : New Moon , '' which held on to the franchise record . `` New Moon '' debuted to a slightly better $ 142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago . What 's interesting is how closely `` Breaking Dawn '' followed `` New Moon 's '' trajectory . `` New Moon '' grossed $ 72.7 million its first day , and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday . By comparison , `` Breaking Dawn '' earned $ 72 million on Friday -LRB- the third-best opening day ever -RRB- , and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today . `` New Moon '' ultimately finished its domestic run with $ 296.6 million , and it 's too early to tell whether `` Breaking Dawn '' will wind up a bit short of that final figure . Even if it does , Summit Entertainment wo n't be complaining about grossing nearly $ 300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise . And , of course , the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here . `` Breaking Dawn '' took in $ 144 million from 54 foreign territories this week , pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $ 283.5 million . Summit reports that `` Breaking Dawn '' attracted a crowd that was , unsurprisingly , 80 percent female . What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie 's audience was n't as young as you 'd think , with 60 percent over the age of 21 . According to CinemaScore , 30 percent of the film 's audience was under 18 , but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34 . The popular conception is that The `` Twilight Saga '' is merely a teenage phenomenon , but these figures seem to prove otherwise . The $ 110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B + rating from CinemaScore graders . In second place was Warner Bros. ' 3-D animated sequel `` Happy Feet Two , '' which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $ 22 million . The 2006 original , an Oscar winner for best animated feature , opened to $ 41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges . `` Happy Feet Two '' was saddled with mediocre reviews , which might have discouraged some parents . Furthermore , five years could have been too long of a wait , especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor . The original `` Happy Feet '' was released a year after March of the Penguins , when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist . That moment has clearly passed . The $ 135 million sequel earned a B + rating from CinemaScore moviegoers , and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally . The rest of the top five consisted of holdovers . The 3-D action flick `` Immortals '' dropped a harsh 62 percent for $ 12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both `` 300 '' -LRB- 54 percent -RRB- and `` Clash of the Titans '' -LRB- 57 percent -RRB- . `` Jack and Jill '' witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $ 12 million . And even though `` Happy Feet Two '' underperformed , `` Puss in Boots '' lost much of its family audience . The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $ 10.7 million in its fourth weekend . In limited release , Alexander Payne 's `` The Descendants , '' starring George Clooney , debuted to $ 1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish . The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $ 42,150 per location . Only `` Midnight in Paris , '' `` The Tree of Life , '' and `` Jane Eyre '' opened to stronger per-theater averages this year , and those movies started out on far fewer screens than `` The Descendants . '' 1 . The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 -- $ 139.5 mil 2 . Happy Feet Two -- $ 22.0 mil 3 . Immortals -- $ 12.3 mil 4 . Jack and Jill -- $ 12.0 mil 5 .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Motor Sport 's governing body , the FIA , have formally confirmed the entry list for the 2010 Formula One season -- with potential newcomers US F1 omitted from the grid . The financially-troubled team had asked the FIA if they could miss the first four races of the season in order to attract extra sponsorship , but have instead been told that they must re-apply if they are to be on the grid for the following season . The official entry list shows 12 teams and 24 drivers -- two teams more than last season . Three new teams are lining up -- Lotus , Virgin Racing and Hispania Racing -- with Toyota deciding to leave the sport . There are also two team name changes . Last year 's winning constructor 's Brawn GP have been taken over by Mercedes , while BMW Sauber have reverted back to being the Sauber team , although they have to retain the BMW title for this season due to legal obligations . Meanwhile , there is also no place on the grid for the proposed Serbian-backed Stefan GP team , who had been hoping to gain a late entry in place of US F1 . An official FIA statement read : `` The US F1 Team have indicated they will not be in a position to participate in the 2010 FIA Formula One world championship . `` Having considered the various options , the FIA confirms it is not possible for a replacement team to be entered for the championship at this late stage . `` In the coming days the FIA will announce details of a new selection process to identify candidates to fill any vacancies existing at the start of the 2011 season . '' US F1 have faced a race against time to have their car ready for the grid , after a number of sponsors opted to pull out the project . Production of the car had been stopped with the team struggling to pay wages , resulting in a number of staff choosing to leave . Team principal Ken Anderson is yet to comment on whether he will attempt to make the grid for the 2011 season . The decision leaves Argentinian Jose Maria Lopez , who had already been offered a drive with US F1 , without a team . Tuesday also saw the final driver appointment confirmed , with Karun Chandhok becoming the second Indian to compete in the sport having been named by Hispania Racing . The 26-year-old follows in the footsteps of Narain Karthikeyan , who had one season with Jordan in 2005 .

{"answer":"CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President-elect Barack Obama told the nation Tuesday night that `` the dream of our founders is alive '' and that he 's ready to fulfill his campaign mantra of bringing change to America . `` Change has come to America , '' President-elect Barack Obama told the nation on Tuesday night . `` At this defining moment , change has come to America , '' Obama , who will be the nation 's first black president , told a crowd of about 125,000 people in Chicago 's Grant Park . Obama , born in Hawaii to a white mother and black father , said his victory proves that America is a place where all things are possible . Paying tribute to the legions of volunteers and voters who carried him to victory , Obama echoed the words of Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address , saying those legions proved `` a government of the people , by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth . '' `` This is your victory , '' he told his supporters , praising `` working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $ 5 and $ 10 and $ 20 to this cause . '' Watch Obama say all things are possible in U.S. \u00c2 '' Obama pledged to heal partisan wounds left after a bruising election battle , again using the words of Lincoln , the first Republican in White House . `` As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours , ` We are not enemies , but friends ... though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . ' `` Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long , '' Obama said . Obama used the life of 106-year-old Ann Nixon Cooper of Atlanta , Georgia , to illustrate what the nation has overcome in her lifetime , including the Depression , world wars , the nation 's quest for civil rights , a man on the moon , the fall of the Berlin Wall and even a world connected by technology . `` Tonight , let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next century ; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper , what change will they see ? What progress will we have made ? '' Obama said . `` This is our chance to answer that call . This is our moment , '' he said . Obama hinted he 's even looking beyond his first term , and through the first eight of those next hundred years . `` The road ahead will be long . Our climb will be steep . We may not get there in one year or even one term , but America -- I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there . I promise you -- we as a people will get there , '' he said . Obama congratulated his rival John McCain and praised McCain 's service to the country as a politician and Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam . `` He fought long and hard in this campaign , and he 's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves , '' Obama said . `` I look forward to working with -LRB- him -RRB- to renew this nation 's promise in the months ahead . '' Watch Obama 's praise of John McCain \u00c2 '' He also thanked his wife , Michelle , and daughters , Sasha and Malia , for their patience through the long presidential campaign . `` You have earned the new puppy that 's coming with us to the White House , '' he told his daughters . Obama spent the first part of his historic Election Day voting , visiting campaign staffers and playing a little basketball . Following an Obama campaign tradition , he arrived Tuesday afternoon at a gym on Chicago 's west side , where a campaign spokeswoman said he met with friends for a game of round ball . The game was the latest stop in Obama 's busy day , which began early in the morning at a polling station in his Hyde Park neighborhood . Earlier , a smiling Obama and his wife cast ballots at the Shoesmith Elementary School . `` I hope this works , '' Obama said after placing his ballot into a scanning machine . `` I 'll be really embarrassed if it does n't .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With a week to go before Election Day , most recent national polls show Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama with an advantage . But how much are they to be believed ? As Election Day gets closer , will the race tighten in the polls ? The most recent national CNN poll of polls showed Obama with an 8-point lead over Republican presidential nominee John McCain , 51 percent to 43 percent . The polls were conducted October 21 through October 26 . Most other national polls show Obama with a lead ranging between 5 points and double digits . A look at CNN polling during the same period before Election Day in 2000 and 2004 suggests that political observers and campaign supporters ought to be cautious in declaring the race over because of current polling numbers . See the latest state and national polls When a presidential race has a non-incumbent in the lead , like this year , the poll numbers tend to tighten as Election Day gets closer , CNN senior researcher Alan Silverleib said . `` Any time it looks like they are on the verge of voting somebody new into office , there is buyer 's remorse , '' he said . `` Based on that , and the fact that the country has been so polarized in recent elections , there 's pretty good reason to think that the polls might tighten up a little bit . '' Four years ago , a national CNN poll of polls released about a week before Election Day showed President Bush leading Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry by 3 points , 49 percent to 46 percent . The poll was released October 25 and reflected likely voters ' choice for president . Election Day was November 2 in 2004 . A national CNN poll of polls released November 1 showed Bush leading Kerry by 2 points , 48 percent to 46 percent . President Bush won by 3 percentage points , 51 percent to 48 percent . In 2000 , it was a bit of a different story . Election Day arrived November 7 that year . A CNN\/USA Today\/Gallup tracking poll conducted October 29 through October 31 showed Bush , then the Texas governor , leading Democratic Sen. Al Gore , 48 percent to 43 percent . The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points . A subsequent poll conducted November 2 through November 4 , released two days before the voters cast their ballots , showed the same results . Gore , however , ended up winning the popular vote by about 540,000 votes . When broken down by percentage , both candidates had about 48 percent of the popular vote . Bush won the Electoral College , and thereby the presidency , by 5 electoral votes . Two of the battleground states this year , as in many recent presidential elections , are Ohio and Florida . What did the polls say before Election Day in those states four years ago ? In Florida , a CNN\/USA Today\/Gallup poll conducted about a week before Election Day showed Bush leading Kerry 51 percent to 43 percent . The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points and was conducted October 21 through October 24 . Kerry caught up to Bush in the polls before Election Day and led by a single point , 48 percent to 47 percent , in a similar poll conducted October 28 through October 31 . The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . Bush won Florida by 5 percentage points in 2004 . In Ohio four years ago , a CNN\/USA Today\/Gallup poll showed Kerry leading Bush by a point -- 49 percent to 48 percent -- about two weeks before Election Day . The poll was conducted October 17 through October 20 and had margin of error of plus or minus 4 points . A week before November 7 , Election Day , a similar poll showed Kerry leading Bush 50 percent to 46 percent . The poll was conducted October 28 through October 31 , and the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points . Bush won Ohio by 2 points in 2004 , 51 percent to 49 percent . Obama leads McCain in recent CNN poll of polls conducted in both states . In Florida , he leads McCain 49 percent to 45 percent . The polls were conducted October 23 through October 26 . In Ohio , Obama has an 8-point lead over McCain , 50 percent to 42 percent . The polls were conducted October 22 through October 27 . ` Buyer 's remorse ' in recent history There have been a few examples of such `` buyer 's remorse '' in recent history , Silverleib said . `` We saw that with -LSB- Arkansas Gov. Bill -RSB- Clinton in 1992 , when the polls suddenly tightened up during the last week , '' he said . `` It was almost like people saying , ` Do we really want this guy ? ' '' They did . Clinton soundly defeated President George H.W. Bush , 43 percent to 37 percent . In another example , polls tightened during the 1968 presidential race between Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat Hubert Humphrey . Nixon led by double digits among registered voters in late September , according to a Gallup analysis published Monday . The lead dwindled to 8 points in a poll conducted October 17 through October 22 . By early November , Nixon was clinging to a 1-point lead . The poll was conducted October 29 through November 1 and surveyed likely voters , according to Gallup . Nixon won by less than 1 percentage point . `` Humphrey had all the momentum at the end , and there 's an open question there that had that election gone on for another week , Humphrey might very well had won , '' Silverleib said . There is then the oft-cited example of Thomas Dewey and Harry Truman in 1948 . Polls predicted that Dewey would win , but Truman pulled off the upset . Silverleib , however , is reluctant to cite that race as illustrative of the accuracy of contemporary polls . `` People talk about Dewey and Truman , but they stopped polling a couple of weeks before the election , '' he said , adding , `` polling then was n't nearly as refined a science as it is now . '' However , in what might be a bit of sobering news for the McCain campaign , since 1956 , front-runners in late October lost the popular vote only twice after being ahead in the Gallup poll a week before Election Day , according to that polling organization 's analysis . Obama held a lead in both of Gallup 's likely voter tracking polls released Tuesday .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN Student News -RRB- -- February marks the beginning of Black History Month , a federally recognized , nationwide celebration that provides the opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the significant roles that African-Americans have played in the shaping of U.S. history . But how did this celebration come to be , and why does it take place in February ? We should emphasize not Negro History , but the Negro in history . What we need is not a history of selected races or nations , but the history of the world void of national bias , race hate , and religious prejudice . - Dr. Carter G. Woodson -LRB- 1875-1950 -RRB- on founding Negro History Week , 1926 Dr. Carter G. Woodson , considered a pioneer in the study of African-American history , is given much of the credit for Black History Month , and has been called the `` Father of Black History . '' The son of former slaves , Woodson spent his childhood working in coalmines and quarries He received his education during the four-month term that was customary for black schools at the time . At 19 , having taught himself English fundamentals and arithmetic , Woodson entered high school , where he completed a four-year curriculum in two years . He went on to receive his Master 's degree in history from the University of Chicago , and he eventually earned a Ph.D from Harvard . Disturbed that history textbooks largely ignored America 's black population , Woodson took on the challenge of writing black Americans into the nation 's history . To do this , Woodson established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History . He also founded the group 's widely respected publication , the Journal of Negro History . In 1926 , he developed Negro History Week . Woodson believed that `` the achievements of the Negro properly set forth will crown him as a factor in early human progress and a maker of modern civilization . '' Woodson chose the second week of February for the celebration because it marks the birthdays of two men who greatly influenced the black American population : Frederick Douglass -LRB- February 14 -RRB- , an escaped slave who became one of the foremost black abolitionists and civil rights leaders in the nation , and President Abraham Lincoln -LRB- February 12 -RRB- , who signed the Emancipation Proclamation , which abolished slavery in America 's confederate states .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A new national poll suggests a majority of Americans oppose legalizing same-sex marriages , but the survey indicates a vast generational divide on the issue . The recent poll shows that those who have a gay friend or relative are more likely to support gay marriage . Fifty-four percent of people questioned in a CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday say marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid , with 44 percent suggesting they should be considered legal . But among those 18 to 34 years old , 58 percent said same-sex marriages should be legal . That number drops to 42 percent among respondents aged 35 to 49 , and to 41 percent for those aged 50 to 64 . Only 24 percent of Americans 65 and older support recognizing same-sex marriages , according to the poll . While a majority of those polled oppose legalizing gay marriage , six of ten said states that do not recognize gay marriages should allow civil unions . When it comes to supporting civil unions , the poll indicates a similar generational shift . Three states -- Massachusetts , Connecticut and Iowa -- currently allow same-sex marriages . A law passed by Vermont legislators that makes gay and lesbian marriages legal takes affect in September . New Hampshire lawmakers are close to passing a similar bill . `` It 's not surprising that three Northeastern states are the first to take this step , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland , referring to Massachusetts , Connecticut and Vermont . `` A majority of people who live in the Northeast say they approve of same-sex marriage . Solid majorities in the South , Midwest and West all oppose gay marriage . '' Forty-nine percent of those questioned say they have a family member or close friend who is gay . That 's up eight points from 1998 and 17 points from 1992 . Fifty-eight percent of those aged 18 to 34 say they have a family member or close friend who 's gay . That drops to just one in three of people 65 or older . `` People who say they have a gay friend or relative support same-sex marriage , '' Holland notes . `` Most of those who say they do n't know anyone who is gay , oppose gay marriage . '' The poll 's release comes just three days after Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced he would step down from the high court after this year 's session ends in late June . Any Supreme Court nomination battle between conservatives and progressives will most likely include hot-button social issues , like gay marriage . `` Republicans do n't have the votes to defeat President Obama 's choice for the Supreme Court . They have to get some Democrats to join them , possibly on a hot-button social issue , '' says Bill Schneider , CNN senior political analyst . The poll indicates that close to 40 percent of Democrats oppose legalizing gay marriage . But Schneider says there 's a risk for conservatives if they make same-sex marriage an issue in the fight over a Supreme Court nomination . `` Young voters strongly favor marriage equality . They 're the future of American politics , '' says Schneider . The CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted April 23-26 , with 2,019 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just one in 10 Latino high school dropouts earns a high school equivalency degree , compared with two in 10 African-American dropouts and three in 10 white dropouts , the Pew Hispanic Center said Thursday . The equivalency degree , called the General Educational Development -LRB- GED -RRB- credential , `` is widely regarded as the best ` second chance ' pathway to college , vocational training and military service for adults who do not graduate from high school , '' the center said on its website . Latinos also have a much higher high school drop-out rate than blacks or whites . About 41 percent of Latinos 20 and older in the United States do not have a regular high school diploma , compared with 23 percent of black adults and 14 percent of white adults , Pew said . Among Latinos , Pew noted , significant differences exist between those who were born in another country and those born in the United States . About 52 percent of foreign-born Latino adults are high school dropouts , compared with 25 percent of the native born , Pew said . Among Latino dropouts , about 21 percent of those born in the United States have a GED , compared with 5 percent of those born abroad , the research center said . A greater percentage of U.S.-born Latinos obtain GEDs because they are more aware of the opportunities available to them , said Richard Fry , the Pew Hispanic Center researcher who compiled the report . `` For the foreign-born , it takes them a little bit of time to learn about the GED , '' Fry told CNN . `` It takes a little bit of time to figure things out . '' Fry said he obtained the information by performing an analysis of newly available educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2008 American Community Survey . That Census Bureau survey was the first to differentiate between those who graduated from high school and those who obtained a GED , Fry said . Previous surveys had lumped both categories together . The Pew analysis also found that in 2008 , Latino adults with a GED had a higher unemployment rate than those with a high school diploma -- 9 percent versus 7 percent . However , the report said , Latino full-time , full-year workers with a GED had about the same mean annual earnings -LRB- $ 33,504 -RRB- as full-time , full-year Latino workers with a high school diploma -LRB- $ 32,972 -RRB- . The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues . Release of the report comes amid heightened tensions over a recent Arizona law that requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals ' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance . Opponents have called for an Arizona tourism boycott and the measure has drawn criticism from Mexico and several Latin American nations . Fry said timing of the report 's release was coincidental . `` There 's nothing magical about it , '' he said . `` The report 's been done for about a week or so and it was time to get it out the door .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serbian police are conducting another search for war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic and another fugitive , the office of the war crimes prosecutor in Belgrade said Friday . Ratko Mladic , pictured in 1993 , is the highest-ranking war crimes suspect still at large . The search , launched at the request of Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic , is being conducted around the town of Arandjelovac , 45 miles -LRB- 75 kilometers -RRB- south of Belgrade , the prosecutor 's office said . Serbia is offering a reward of 1 million euros for information leading to the capture of Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian Serb general wanted by the United Nations ' International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , ICTY , in the Hague . A reward of $ 250,000 is offered for information leading to the arrest of Serbia 's other fugitive , Goran Hadzic . Mladic is the highest-ranking figure from the conflict to remain at large following the July arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . Mladic commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The U.N. tribunal indicted Mladic in 1995 , along with 51 others , on charges involving war crimes and atrocities committed during four years of civil war . In July 1996 , an international arrest warrant was issued for Mladic after investigators collected evidence at the site of the Srebrenica massacre . Mladic stepped down as military commander in November 1996 and returned to Belgrade . But he disappeared after former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 . The 66-year-old faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity over the killing of some 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995 . He 's also wanted for his role in the 1992 shelling of Sarajevo . In 1992 , as hostilities broke out in Sarajevo , Mladic led the `` shelling and sniping to target civilian areas of the city and its civilian population and institutions , killing and wounding civilians , and thereby also inflicting terror upon the civilian population , '' the war crimes tribunal contends . The status of Mladic is one of the major stumbling block 's to Serbia 's admission to the European Union . In April Serbia 's government signed a preliminary agreement setting the country on the path to full EU membership . But ratification of the agreement was made conditional on Serbia sending Mladic to the Hague . CNN 's Ben Blake in London , England , contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some $ 700 million in economic stimulus money intended to upgrade baggage screening systems at airports will go further than originally expected , Department of Homeland Security officials said Wednesday . The new systems can process up to 500 bags an hour , compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour on the older machines , the TSA said . The DHS said the money will now upgrade systems at 10 additional airports . Earlier this year the DHS announced funding for baggage screening at airports in 15 cities . The money will be used to speed up construction of in-line baggage screening systems , which take advantage of the airline 's existing conveyor belt systems to check bags , eliminating the need for minivan-size bomb detection systems now found in many airport lobbies . Government auditors have long complained about existing systems , which the Transportation Security Administration rushed into place to meet congressional deadlines after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . At airports with in-line systems , airline workers at the ticketing counters place the bags on conveyor belts , which pass through explosive detectors on their way to the aircraft . That is more efficient than stand-alone systems , which the TSA employees must staff . In addition , in-line systems can process up to 500 bags an hour , compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour processed by stand-alone machines , the TSA said . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement that DHS was able to `` stretch our resources '' by managing the recovery money and by negotiating with airports . In addition to the $ 700 million intended for checked baggage systems , $ 300 million is being allocated for checkpoint technology , such as new X-ray machines , `` whole body imaging '' technology and bottled liquid scanners . The new airports expected to get stimulus money for in-line explosive detection systems are : \u2022 Washington Dulles International Airport -LRB- Chantilly , Virginia -RRB- \u2022 Lambert-St .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Conan O'Brien suggested in a statement Tuesday that he will not accept NBC 's proposal to move him and `` The Tonight Show , '' which he 's hosted for seven months , to 12:05 a.m. ET . NBC has proposed moving `` The Tonight Show '' from its traditional 11:35 p.m. slot so that the show 's former host , Jay Leno , could host a half-hour show then . `` My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of ` The Tonight Show . ' But I can not participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction , '' O'Brien said . `` Some people will make the argument that with DVRs and the Internet a time slot does n't matter . But with the Tonight Show , I believe nothing could matter more . `` There has been speculation about my going to another network but , to set the record straight , I currently have no other offer and honestly have no idea what happens next . My hope is that NBC and I can resolve this quickly so that my staff , crew , and I can do a show we can be proud of , for a company that values our work . '' Read O'Brien 's full statement After Leno left `` The Tonight Show '' last year -- as part of an agreement reached six years ago giving it to O'Brien -- he began hosting `` The Jay Leno Show '' for NBC in the fall , airing at 10 p.m. ET . But ratings for the 10 p.m. show were low , and on Sunday , NBC announced that it was taking Leno out of the prime-time slot because the show `` did n't meet affiliates ' needs '' despite performing at acceptable levels for the network . The last show will air February 11 to make way for the 2010 Winter Olympics , which airs starting February 12 . Jeff Gaspin , chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment , said the plan was for Leno to host a new , half-hour show at 11:35 p.m. ET , followed by `` Tonight '' with O'Brien at 12:05 a.m. and Jimmy Fallon 's `` Late Night '' show moving to 1 a.m. . As of Sunday , NBC was still negotiating with the three hosts over the proposed lineup . iReport : Share your view on the late-night shakeup O'Brien , in his statement Tuesday , said the plan was n't acceptable . `` For 60 years the ` Tonight Show ' has aired immediately following the late local news . I sincerely believe that delaying ` The Tonight Show ' into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting , '' O'Brien said . '' ` The Tonight Show ' at 12:05 simply is n't ` The Tonight Show . ' `` Also , if I accept this move I will be knocking the ` Late Night ' show , which I inherited from David Letterman and passed on to Jimmy Fallon , out of its long-held time slot . That would hurt the other NBC franchise that I love , and it would be unfair to Jimmy . '' Fox 's president of entertainment , Kevin Reilly , told reporters on Monday that his network may be interested in O'Brien should he leave `` Tonight . '' `` I love him , '' Reilly said at the Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena , California . `` It 's a very compatible fit for our brand . He is one of the few guys in the planet who has demonstrated he can do one of these shows every night . '' In monologues on their respective shows on Monday , Leno and O'Brien had zingers about the looming shakeup . `` NBC said the show performed exactly as they expected it would and then canceled us . Do n't confuse this -LSB- with -RSB- when we were on at late night and performed better than expected and they canceled us . That was totally different , '' Leno quipped .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. George Tiller , whose Kansas women 's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion , was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning , police said . Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians that performed late-term abortions . Wichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City , Kansas , area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller , who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions . The killing , which came about 16 years after Tiller survived a shooting outside his Wichita clinic , took place shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday at Reformation Lutheran Church . Officers found the 67-year-old dead in the foyer , police said . Witnesses provided a description of the car and a license number of the killer 's getaway vehicle , Wichita police spokesman Gordon Bassham said . Police stopped a blue Ford Taurus matching the description about three hours later in Gardner , about 30 miles southwest of Kansas City , and took the driver into custody . No charges had been filed Sunday evening and no motive for the killing was immediately known , but Wichita police Detective Tom Stoltz told reporters : `` We think we have the right person arrested . '' `` We will investigate this suspect to the Nth degree -- his history , his family , his associates -- and we are just in the beginning stages of that , '' Stoltz said . See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller 's murder '' Tiller 's slaying drew condemnation from supporters , from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama , who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek `` common ground '' on the issue of abortion . `` However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they can not be resolved by heinous acts of violence , '' Obama said in a statement issued by the White House . The shooting prompted U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to direct federal marshals to `` offer protection to other appropriate people and facilities around the nation , '' according to a statement from the Department of Justice . Tiller had been practicing medicine for nearly 40 years , said Peter Brownlie , president of the Kansas City-based regional Planned Parenthood office . His patients were `` almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy , '' and where a woman 's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued , Brownlie said . He and his staff had been picketed for years , with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood , Brownlie said . His clinic suffered serious damage from a bomb in the mid-1990s , and he was shot through both arms in 1993 by an anti-abortion activist who is currently serving time in federal prison . `` He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis , '' Brownlie said . `` As recently as early this month the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so . '' Watch Tiller describe the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 '' Tiller had armed security at his clinic and a `` pretty rigorous '' security procedure at home , Brownlie said . But he `` made an effort to live his life as normally as possible knowing he could be a target at any time , '' he said . In a statement issued through Tiller 's lawyers , his family -- a wife , four children and 10 grandchildren -- said their loss `` is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America . '' `` George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence , '' his family said in a written statement . `` We ask that he be remembered as a good husband , father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere . '' In March , Tiller was acquitted of 19 counts of performing procedures unlawfully at his clinic . In 2008 , a probe initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges . Leading anti-abortion groups condemned Sunday 's shooting , emphasizing they wanted to shut down Tiller 's practice by legal means . Operation Rescue , which has led numerous demonstrations at Tiller 's clinic , called the shooting as a `` cowardly act . '' And the National Right to Life Committee , the largest U.S. anti-abortion group , said it `` unequivocally condemns any such acts of violence regardless of motivation . '' `` The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life , '' it said . `` The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal . '' But Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry , who is no longer affiliated with the group , called Tiller `` a mass murderer . '' `` We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God , '' Terry said in a written statement . `` I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller 's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions . Abortion is still murder , and we still must call abortion by its proper name . '' The National Organization for Women , which supports abortion rights , called Tiller 's killing an act of `` domestic terrorism . '' And NARAL Pro-Choice America said Tiller had worked for years under `` intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence . '' If Tiller was killed because of his work , he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993 . See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 '' In 1998 , a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his Amherst , New York , home . Anti-abortion activist James Kopp was later arrested in France and is serving life in prison . In 1994 , Dr. John Bayard Britton and one of his volunteer escorts were shot and killed outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola , Florida . Paul Hill , a former minister , was convicted of the killings and executed in 2003 . And in 1993 , another doctor , David Gunn , was shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic . His killer , Michael Griffin , is serving a life sentence . In addition , a nurse at a Birmingham , Alabama , clinic was maimed and an off-duty police officer was killed in a 1998 bombing by Eric Rudolph , who included abortion among his list of anti-government grievances . Rudolph admitted to that attack and three other bombings -- including the 1996 attack on the Olympic games in Atlanta , Georgia -- and is currently serving life in prison .

Patrick Leahy , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , helped close the debate by stressing the historic nature of the nomination . `` It is distinctively American to continually refine our union , moving us closer to our ideals . Our union is not yet perfected , but with this confirmation , we will be making progress , '' Leahy said on the Senate floor . `` Years from now , we will remember this time , when we crossed paths with the quintessentially American journey of Sonia Sotomayor , and when our nation took another step forward through this historic confirmation process . '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , took aim at what he claimed was Sotomayor 's inability to refrain from bringing her personal political opinions to bear on her rulings . `` This is the most fundamental test for any judge and all the more so for those who would sit on our nation 's highest court , where a judge 's impulses and preferences are not subject to review . Because I 'm not convinced that Judge Sotomayor would keep this commitment , I can not support her nomination . '' Several Republicans , however , bucked party leadership by voting in favor of Sotomayor . Sen. George Voinovich , R-Ohio , announced Thursday morning that he had decided to back Sotomayor after weighing a range of factors , including her education , experience and temperament . `` Judge Sotomayor is not the nominee I would have selected if I were president , but making a nomination is not my role here today , '' Voinovich said . `` My role is to examine her qualifications to determine if she is fit to serve . ... Based on my review of her record , and using these factors , I have determined that Judge Sotomayor meets the criteria to become a justice on the Supreme Court . '' Voinovich was joined by Maine 's Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , New Hampshire 's Judd Gregg , Indiana 's Richard Lugar , Missouri 's Kit Bond , Florida 's Mel Martinez , South Carolina 's Lindsey Graham and Tennessee 's Lamar Alexander . Watch the Senate vote '' In a telling political sign , none of the Republicans who voted for Sotomayor is seeking re-election in 2010 . Conservative activists , including the powerful National Rifle Association , mounted a concerted effort to rally GOP opposition to Sotomayor . The abortion issue also played a significant role in the nomination , with abortion-rights supporters backing Sotomayor and opponents urging her defeat . `` Today 's historic vote is a sign of progress for Americans who want a Supreme Court that values individual freedom and privacy , '' said Nancy Keenan , head of the group National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America . Charmaine Yoest , head of Americans United For Life , praised the 31 Republican senators who opposed Sotomayor for a `` stunning vote of ` no confidence ' in a nominee whose background of abortion advocacy and record of judicial interventionism raise serious questions about her fitness for the high court . '' Underlying the debate over Sotomayor was the larger political question of whether the Republican Party risked alienating Hispanic voters by opposing the first Latina nominee . The party 's share of the Hispanic vote dropped sharply in last year 's presidential election . `` If you meet all of the challenges that you are told you need to meet and still you can be told no , despite fidelity to Constitution , the law and precedent , then it sends a tough message to us as a community , '' said Sen. Robert Menendez , D-New Jersey . Sotomayor 's confirmation capped an extraordinary rise from humble beginnings . Her parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II . Her father worked in a factory and did n't speak English . She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project , not far from the stadium of her favorite team , the New York Yankees . Her father died when she was 9 , leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother . Her mother , whom Sotomayor has described as her biggest inspiration , worked six days a week to care for her and her brother , and instilled in them the value of an education . Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale Law School , where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal . She worked at nearly every level of the judicial system over a three-decade career before being chosen by President Obama to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court . Accepting the nomination , Sotomayor thanked Obama for `` the most humbling honor of my life . '' After the selection , Sotomayor was touted by her supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal . She has served as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1998 . She was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton . Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court . Before her judicial appointments , she was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes .

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination , the CDC said late Monday . The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville , New York , was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli , a potentially deadly species of bacteria . The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe 's , Price Chopper , Lancaster and Wild Harvest , Shaw 's , BJ 's , Ford Brothers , and Giant Food Stores . The exact products affected are listed on the USDA 's Web site . The recall was for distribution centers in eight states , but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states . Each package is printed with `` EST. 492 '' inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label . They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28 , the USDA said . Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall , the USDA said . E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and in the most severe cases , kidney failure . The very young , seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness . The USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products , whether they are fresh or frozen , and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit . The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature , the FSIS said . Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak , eight are in Massachusetts ; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire ; two each are in Maine , Pennsylvania and South Dakota ; and one each is in California , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Vermont , according to the CDC .","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- African-Americans are extremely supportive of President Obama , but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year , according to a new national poll . The CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey , released Tuesday , also indicates that Obama 's presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations , but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country . More than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job Obama 's doing in the White House , far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president . But when asked how they personally feel about Obama 's presidency , only 42 percent of black respondents say they 're thrilled , with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled . The 42 percent who are thrilled is down from 61 percent in January , when Obama was inaugurated . `` African-Americans are still big fans of the first black president in U.S. history , but the thrill is gone , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . According to the poll , 51 percent of African-Americans say Obama 's presidency has brought some improvement in race relations in the U.S. , but only 18 percent feel it 's the start of a new era . Another 23 percent say they 've seen a real change in race relations over the past 11 months and 7 percent say things have gotten worse . The survey indicates that three-quarters of blacks believe race relations will improve eventually , which is up from 49 percent of blacks who felt that way a year before Obama was elected . `` Whites take a dimmer view of Obama 's effect on race relations , with a third believing that the new presidency has not changed race relations in the country and 15 percent of whites saying that Obama has made race relations worse , '' Holland added . `` Not surprisingly , whites are less supportive of Obama , although for a notable number of whites , their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he 's not been liberal enough . '' The CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 16-20 , with 1,160 adult Americans , including 259 African-Americans and 786 whites , questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6 percentage points for the African-Americans sample .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Texas grand jury indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on sexual assault charges , and five of his followers also face a variety of charges , state Attorney General Greg Abbott said . Members of the polygamous FLDS revere jailed leader Warren Jeffs as their prophet . Jeffs was charged in the Tuesday indictment with sexual assault of a child , a first-degree felony . A conviction on the charge could mean a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $ 10,000 , said Dirk Fillpot , a spokesman for the attorney general . Jeffs , 52 , is the so-called leader and `` prophet '' of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , which broke off from mainstream Mormonism in the 1890s over the practice of polygamy . The FLDS openly practices polygamy at its Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado , Texas , and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line : Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona . Jeffs is accused in the indictment of assaulting a child `` younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant '' in January 2005 . The alleged victim , whose name is redacted on the document , `` was a person who the defendant was prohibited from marrying or purporting to marry or with whom the defendant was prohibited from living under the appearance of being married '' under Texas law . The indictments , which were handed down by a grand jury in San Angelo , Texas , also charge four of Jeffs ' followers with single counts of sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 17 . One of the four also faces a count of bigamy . A fifth follower is charged with three counts of failure to report child abuse . The Texas attorney general 's office was cooperating with other agencies to ensure the five others would be taken into custody , Fillpot said . Their names have not been made public , and only Jeffs ' indictment has been released . Jeffs has been in custody since August 2006 , when he was arrested during a routine traffic stop after spending several months on the FBI 's 10 most wanted fugitives list . Jeffs is serving two consecutive sentences of five years to life in prison on accomplice to rape charges in Utah for his role in the marriage of a sect member to his 14-year-old cousin . He is being held Arizona while he awaits trial on similar charges . It was not immediately clear when Jeffs would be brought to Texas . Authorities seized more than 400 children in April during a raid on the Texas ranch . The children were returned to their families after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children and lacked evidence to show they faced imminent danger of abuse . In May , DNA samples were taken from Jeffs as part of a criminal investigation into allegations that he `` spiritually '' married four girls ranging in age from 12 to 15 , authorities said . A search warrant seeking the DNA samples said marital records -- known as bishop 's records -- from the ranch show that Jeffs married a 14-year-old girl on January 18 , 2004 , in Utah . The records showed that Jeffs `` married '' two 12-year-olds and a 14-year-old at the YFZ Ranch , according to the search warrant . One of the 12-year-olds , believed to have married Jeffs on July 27 , 2006 , was sexually assaulted by Jeffs later that day , the search warrant said . The warrant made reference to pictures of Jeffs with his alleged underage brides . In one photograph , the warrant states , he is kissing one of the 12-year-olds . In another , he is shown with a 15-year-old wife at the birth of their child in October 2004 . Authorities had said the DNA samples would determine whether he is the father of the children born to underage mothers . FLDS spokesman Rod Parker , who is vacationing in Colorado this week , had no immediate comment on the indictment Tuesday . `` As far as an indictment of Warren Jeffs , I 'd want to know a little more before I start talking about it , '' he said . On Thursday , the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to hold a hearing on polygamy and the need for a `` coordinated state and federal response , '' according to an agenda . Carolyn Jessop , a former FLDS member who recently wrote a book about leaving her marriage and the sect , is scheduled to testify , along with federal prosecutors , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and the attorneys general of Texas and Arizona .","question":""}

{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. military announced Wednesday that coalition forces recently killed al Qaeda in Iraq 's `` charismatic '' senior leader in northern Iraq . Abu Qaswarah was second only to Abu Ayyub al-Masri -LRB- pictured -RRB- in al Qaeda in Iraq leadership . Abu Qaswarah , also known as Abu Sara , was killed during an operation in Mosul on October 5 , the military said . The Moroccan native was second-in-command to al Qaeda in Iraq -LRB- AQI -RRB- leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri , according to the military . He had `` historic ties '' to al-Masri 's predecessor , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , and senior al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the military said . Abu Qaswarah -- who became AQI 's senior leader in northern Iraq in June 2007 -- was the target of the military raid in Mosul earlier this month , the military said . Coalition forces tracked him down inside a building in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul , which `` served as a key command and control location for AQI , '' according to the military . `` Upon entering the building , forces were immediately fired upon , '' the military said . `` Coalition forces returned fire in self-defense , leading to the death of five terrorists . It was later determined that one of the five was positively identified as Abu Qaswarah . '' The U.S. military described Abu Qaswarah as a `` charismatic '' leader who rallied al Qaeda in Iraq 's northern network after `` major setbacks to the terrorist organization across Iraq . '' Groups comprised mainly of former Sunni insurgents -- known as Awakening Councils or `` Sons of Iraq '' -- have turned against al Qaeda in Iraq , helping to diminish its presence in several parts of the country . The U.S. military credits them with playing a key role in bringing about the nationwide drop in violence that coincided with the `` surge '' of U.S. forces . Abu Qaswarah -- who trained with al Qaeda in Afghanistan -- helped bring foreign terrorists into northern Iraq , where they carried out a spate of suicide attacks , according to the military . He also organized and led AQI 's attacks in Mosul , including the `` failed attempt to destroy the Mosul Civic Center during the holy month of Ramadan , '' which took place in September , the military said . That attack , the military said , `` could have killed hundreds of innocent Iraqis . '' The military said Abu Qaswarah 's death `` will significantly degrade AQI operations in Mosul and northern Iraq , leaving the network without a leader to oversee and coordinate its operations in the region .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A grand jury has indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on a second sexual assault charge in connection with a probe of his Texas compound , prosecutors said Wednesday . The charge against Warren Jeffs stems from a probe into his sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch near Eldorado , Texas . The Schleicher County , Texas , grand jury charged Jeffs , who already could be sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of a different charge in Utah , with a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault . The indictment is Jeffs ' second in Schleicher County . In July , he was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17 . Grand jurors have also indicted three more members of Jeffs ' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , prosecutors said Wednesday . One member faces a count of conducting the unlawful marriage of a minor , another faces three counts of bigamy and a third faces three counts of bigamy and one count of tampering with evidence . The Texas charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado , about 190 miles northwest of San Antonio . In April , child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound , citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse . After a court battle , the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June , saying the state had no right to remove them and there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch . To date , 12 people associated with the compound have been indicted as part of the investigation , Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said . Jeffs , 52 , is the leader and `` prophet '' of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS , an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church . The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch , as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line -- Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona . In Utah , Jeffs was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old . He is awaiting trial in Arizona , where he faces similar charges . He faces a sentence of up to life in prison for the Utah conviction , and he also could face another life term if convicted of the Texas charges . His attorney in Arizona , Michael Piccarreta , has questioned the motives of Texas authorities , telling CNN in a July interview that the state 's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort `` to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas .

Friends and colleagues were saddened by her death . `` Natasha was brilliant , beautiful , funny , talented beyond measure , as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp , '' said Jodie Foster , who worked with Richardson in `` Nell , '' in a statement . `` Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her . May Liam , her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment . '' `` Natasha combined the best of -LSB- her parents , Vanessa -RSB- Redgrave and -LSB- Tony -RSB- Richardson : the enormous depth and emotional force of a great actor on the one hand , and the intelligence and objectivity of a great director on the other . She was a one-of-a-kind , a magnificent actress , '' said director Sam Mendes in a statement . Mendes directed Richardson in her Tony-winning `` Cabaret '' performance . Richardson was practically born to perform . Her grandfather , Sir Michael Redgrave , was a famed British actor . Her mother , Vanessa Redgrave , is an Oscar-winning actress , and her father , the late director Tony Richardson , helmed such films as `` Look Back in Anger , '' `` The Entertainer '' and the Oscar-winning `` Tom Jones . '' Natasha Richardson 's uncle Corin Redgrave , aunt Lynn Redgrave , and sister Joely Richardson are also noted performers . But being part of a family of actors was n't always easy for Richardson . Her parents divorced when she was 4 and her mother , involved in controversial political causes , gave away a lot of money , putting the family in financial straits , according to the BBC . Then there was the family heritage , of which Richardson once said , `` Though my name opened doors it did n't get me work , and a lot of pressure comes from having a mother who is considered one of the greatest actresses of her generation , '' the BBC reported . In 2007 , Richardson worked with her mother in the film `` Evening . '' Richardson said she made one point to director Lajos Koltai about the relatives working together . `` This is a unique opportunity , '' she said she told him . `` This is the one time my mother and I are going to play mother and daughter on screen , so you 've got to take advantage of it . '' Watch Richardson talk about working with her mom '' Richardson 's first film role was a bit part in her father 's `` The Charge of the Light Brigade '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , made when she was 4 . After a handful of roles through her teens and early 20s , she broke through as Mary Shelley in Ken Russell 's film `` Gothic , '' and followed that up as Patty Hearst in Paul Schrader 's 1988 film of the same name . iReport.com : Share memories of Richardson Richardson 's other notable films included `` The Handmaid 's Tale '' -LRB- 1990 -RRB- ; the TV movie `` Zelda '' -LRB- 1993 -RRB- ; `` Nell '' -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , alongside Neeson , whom she married in 1994 ; the 1998 remake of `` The Parent Trap '' ; and `` Wild Child '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- . Watch Larry King and his panel talk about Richardson 's career and death '' But some of Richardson 's greatest successes were on the stage . At 22 , she played opposite her mother and Jonathan Pryce in a London production of Anton Chekhov 's `` The Seagull '' ; the performance earned her the London Drama Critics ' most promising newcomer award . She won a Tony for her performance as Sally Bowles in the 1998 revival of `` Cabaret '' and earned raves for her Blanche DuBois in a 2005 production of `` A Streetcar Named Desire .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- William Safire , a onetime speechwriter for President Nixon who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times , has died at age 79 , the newspaper announced Sunday . William Safire died in Maryland following a battle with pancreatic cancer , The New York Times reported . Safire joined the Times as a columnist in 1973 . In addition to his conservative news columns , which he wrote until 2005 , he wrote a language column for the paper 's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death . He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978 . In 2006 , President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest U.S. civilian honor . Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville , Maryland , the newspaper reported . Born in New York in 1929 , Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers , television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University . After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s , he was credited with putting together the 1959 `` kitchen debate '' between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year 's American National Exhibition in Moscow . Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time . `` What I was publicizing was the typical American house , '' he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July . `` It was my kitchen . '' The next year , he went to work for Nixon 's first , unsuccessful presidential bid . He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968 , when the Republican eventually won the White House , and became one of the administration 's top speechwriters . Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew 's denunciation of journalists as `` nattering nabobs of negativism . '' But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973 , when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times . His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a `` congenital liar '' -- held down the right flank of the Times ' op-ed page for more than three decades . He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance , who as President Carter 's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud . Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980 . And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq 's Kurdish population . He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s , when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt , and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , writing that `` nobody came out of this war more nobly '' than the Kurds . Safire also wrote four novels , several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968 . A new edition came out in 2008 . He is survived by his wife , Helene , two children and one grandchild .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Women run a lower risk of having babies with certain birth defects if they eat a diet rich in fruits , vegetables , and whole grains during their childbearing years , a new study suggests . Women who followed healthy Mediterranean-style diets in the year before pregnancy were up to one-half as likely as those who ate diets high in meat , fat , and sugar to have a baby with anencephaly , a neural-tube defect that blocks the development of the brain and tends to result in miscarriage . Compared with fat - and sugar-heavy diets , healthier diets -- which included plenty of folate , iron , and calcium -- were also associated with up to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip , a one-quarter lower risk of cleft palate , and a one-fifth lower risk of spina bifida , another neural-tube defect . `` Diet quality matters , and it was protective , '' says Suzan L. Carmichael , Ph.D. , the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine , in Palo Alto , California . Health.com : Feed the Belly : Recipes for a healthy pregnancy The defects covered in the study are very rare overall , occurring in less than 0.1 % of all births . They have become less common since the 1990s , when government health officials led a campaign to increase folic-acid intake among pregnant women through supplements and fortified grain products . Deficiencies in folic acid -- the synthetic form of folate , a B vitamin -- have been linked to both neural-tube defects and cleft lip and palate . Carmichael and her colleagues took into account whether the women in the study were taking folic acid , which suggests that a healthy diet provides protection against birth defects over and above that provided by folic acid . Women of childbearing age should , however , still take folic-acid supplements , says Gail Harrison , Ph.D. , a professor of community health services at the UCLA School of Public Health , in Los Angeles . `` Folic acid has made a difference , '' says Harrison , who was not involved in the study . `` In countries that have used fortification levels higher than the U.S. , it has made an even bigger impact . '' Health.com : How to soothe heartburn during pregnancy Most research on diet and birth defects has focused on single nutrients , such as vitamins A and B12 -LRB- in addition to folate -RRB- . Carmichael and her colleagues took a different approach by looking at overall diet quality -- a method that has become common in cancer and heart-disease research . The government-funded study , which appears this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , compared the diets of 3,824 mothers whose children experienced birth defects with those of 6,807 mothers of healthy children . The researchers collected detailed questionnaires about the women 's diets in the year before they became pregnant , and used that data to score their diet quality on two indexes , one modeled on the U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines and another based on the Mediterranean diet . Both indexes considered fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and `` good '' fats to be healthy , and saturated fats and sweets to be unhealthy . Health.com : Good fats , bad fats : how to choose Across the board , women with the healthiest diets were far less likely to have had children with birth defects than the women with the poorest-quality diets . High scores on both indexes were associated with a reduced risk of defects , although the association was stronger for the USDA score . Seventy-eight percent of the women took supplements containing folic acid during early pregnancy , but higher-quality diets were protective regardless of whether the women took folic acid . The study authors and other experts strongly recommend that pregnant women continue taking folic-acid supplements . But the study does raise the general question of whether `` eating the right foods '' can provide health benefits that supplements do not , says David R. Jacobs Jr. , Ph.D. , a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota , in Minneapolis . Health.com : Diabetes ? 7 tips for a healthy pregnancy `` We have evolved to eat food . We have not evolved to eat supplements , '' says Jacobs , who cowrote an editorial accompanying the study . `` If you would like to be healthy , the better way to do that is by getting what you need from food rather than isolated compounds .

{"answer":"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The 2012 box office got off to a fine start this weekend , as Paramount 's `` found footage '' -LRB- riiiight ... -RRB- horror movie `` The Devil Inside , '' which the studio acquired for just under $ 1 million , earned a tremendous $ 34.5 million in its first three days , becoming the first breakout box office star since `` The Lion King 3D . '' In fact , the strong debut marks the third-best January opening of all time behind `` Cloverfield '' -LRB- $ 40.1 million -RRB- and a re-release of `` Star Wars '' -LRB- $ 35.9 million -RRB- . Is this a sign of things to come in 2012 ? Perhaps . But it 's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies . Demonic tales have made a mini-comeback in the last few years -- starting with the success of 2005 \u2032 s `` The Exorcism of Emily Rose , '' which earned $ 75.1 million domestically . Since then , similar titles like 2009 \u2032 s `` The Haunting in Connecticut '' -LRB- $ 55.4 million -RRB- , 2010 \u2032 s `` The Last Exorcism '' -LRB- $ 41 million -RRB- , and 2011 \u2032 s `` Insidious '' -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets . `` Insidious , '' for example , cost just $ 1.5 million to make . Of course , the `` Paranormal Activity '' movies -LRB- the fourth of which was just announced this week -RRB- are the biggest success stories of this whole trend . A total of $ 8 million has been spent making the three `` found footage '' movies , yet they have earned $ 296.7 million domestically . Paramount marketed `` The Devil Inside '' in much the same way the studio markets the `` Paranormal '' films . Commercials included ample shots of audiences screaming at the screen , and viewers were encouraged to use social media to chat up the film with the `` Tweet Your Scream '' campaign . Indeed , all the promotional costs -- certainly a much higher number than the budget -- helped `` The Devil Inside '' achieve a stellar debut , but where does it go from here ? Well , it falls . Fast . Due to their overwhelmingly young audiences , who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend , horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office , but `` The Devil Inside , '' with its utterly terrible `` F '' CinemaScore grade -LRB- some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an `` F '' or closer to the `` C '' range -RRB- , will likely plummet even more quickly . Not that it really matters , though -- the horror pic is already in the black , and it may finish with as much as $ 70 million . In second place , `` Mission : Impossible - Ghost Protocol , '' another Paramount film , continued its comeback performance with $ 20.5 million in its fourth weekend . The action blockbuster , which became the biggest hit of the holidays , has now earned $ 170.2 million , and it should finish well above $ 200 million . `` Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows '' held onto third place with a $ 14.1 million weekend . The sequel , which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original `` Sherlock Holmes , '' has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks . After two weekends , `` Shadows '' was trailing `` Sherlock Holmes '' by $ 59.7 million , but over the past two weeks , the sequel has narrowed that gap to $ 22.7 million , and it now has a running total of $ 157.4 million -- still disappointing , but not nearly the disaster it first appeared . `` The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo '' finished the frame in fourth place with $ 11.3 million , dipping only 24 percent , the smallest drop in the Top 10 . Could the edgy adaptation finally be finding its adult audience now that the warm n ' fuzzy holiday season is over ? After 19 days , `` Dragon Tattoo '' has grossed $ 76.8 million , and if it maintains strong holds like this , it should pass $ 100 million . `` Alvin and the Chipmunks : Chipwrecked '' rounds out the Top 5 . The kiddie threequel , which has majorly underperformed compared to expectations , dropped 42 percent to $ 9.5 million . It has now grossed $ 111.6 million total . The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing . Two of them , `` War Horse '' and `` We Bought A Zoo , '' are performing respectably , though . The films earned $ 8.6 and $ 8.5 million , respectively , this weekend , and they have nearly identical totals of $ 56.8 million and $ 56.6 million . Still , there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that `` War Horse '' -LRB- which cost $ 66 million -RRB- is performing admirably , while `` We Bought A Zoo '' -LRB- which cost $ 50 million -RRB- kind of fizzled , to which I say : Huh ?! In eighth place is a movie which has actually fizzled -- at least domestically . `` The Adventures of Tintin , '' Steven Spielberg 's expensive motion-capture animation , dropped 42 percent this weekend to $ 6.6 million and $ 61.9 million total . In ninth place , Focus Features ' `` Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy , '' which expanded into 809 theaters this weekend , performed admirably in its wider release . The well-reviewed spy drama maintained a robust $ 7,129 per theater average , giving the film a $ 5.8 million weekend and an early $ 10.4 million total after five weekends . `` New Year 's Eve '' held onto a spot in the Top 10 for one final weekend . The ensemble romantic comedy fell 48 percent to $ 3.3 million . The film has earned $ 52 million -LRB- less than half the gross of Valentine 's Day -RRB- , and it likely wo n't make it much further . 1 . The Devil Inside - $ 34.5 million 2 . Mission : Impossible -- Ghost Protocol - $ 20.5 million 3 . Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows - $ 14 million 4 . The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - $ 11.3 million 5 .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite the bruising battle over their proposals to overhaul health care , congressional Democrats have maintained an advantage over their Republican counterparts on one key measure , according to a new national poll . A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday indicates that a bare majority of Americans , 51 percent , believe that the Democrats ' policies are good for the country , with 46 percent saying that those policies would take the U.S. in the wrong direction . Fifty-three percent of people questioned in the poll said the GOP 's polices would move the nation in the wrong direction , with 42 percent saying Republican policies are good for the country . `` The numbers for both parties are virtually unchanged since late August , just before President Barack Obama 's health care speech to Congress opened the latest round of debate on this divisive issue , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . Democrats will be defending their large majorities in Congress next year when all 435 House seats and more than a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs . `` This advantage on policy could be an important edge for the Democrats heading into the 2010 midterm elections , '' Holland added . `` But independents will be the key to the midterms , and the numbers among independents spell bad news for both parties among that important group . '' In an August survey , independent voters ' views of GOP policies were evenly divided . But a majority of independents now say Republicans would move the country in the wrong direction . Nonetheless , the number of independents who dislike Democratic policies , now at 57 percent , is higher than the 52 percent who hold a negative view of Republican policies . The survey suggests that Sen. Joe Lieberman is taking a hit in popularity due to his opposition to a major element in the health care bill . The Connecticut independent , who caucuses with the Democrats to give the party a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority in the Senate , threatened to undermine the bill unless compromises were made . Lieberman opposed the creation of a government-run public insurance option and the expansion of Medicare to individuals as young as 55 . Both of those proposals were dropped from the bill this month , enraging many liberals . According to the poll , Lieberman 's favorable rating has dropped 9 percentage points , from 40 percent to 31 percent , from early December . His unfavorable rating has risen 6 percentage points , from 28 percent to 34 percent . `` Lieberman 's biggest decline -- a 14-point drop -- came among independents , '' Holland said . `` Only Republicans continue to like Lieberman . '' The survey also indicates that just one in five Americans trust the federal government always or most of the time , down 4 percentage points from a year ago . The CNN\/Opinion Research poll was conducted December 16 through Sunday , with 1,160 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After about 30 hours of deliberation , a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago . Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing . Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square , Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced . Now 69 , he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29 . Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date , Spector quietly answered , `` Yes . '' Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict , and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson 's family . But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector 's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal . `` We do n't believe justice was done , '' Weinberg said . Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing , citing Spector 's years-long `` pattern of violence '' involving firearms . Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict '' `` This was not an isolated incident , '' Fidler said , noting Spector 's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s . `` The taking of an innocent human life , it does n't get any more serious than that . '' Spector 's wife , Rachelle , was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday , as was Clarkson 's mother , Donna . Clarkson , 40 , was found dead , slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector 's Alhambra , California , mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003 . A mistrial was declared in Spector 's first trial in September 2007 . After deliberating 15 days , jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict . Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial . Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction . In closing arguments at the retrial , prosecutor Truc Do called Spector `` a very dangerous man '' who `` has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women . Lana just happened to be the sixth . '' Weinberg argued that the prosecution 's case hinged on circumstantial evidence . He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out . Do pointed out , however , to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done , the prosecutor said . A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict . `` This entire jury took this so seriously , '' she said with tears in her eyes , before adding that `` it 's tough to be in a jury , '' because another person 's life is in the jury 's hands . Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie `` Barbarian Queen '' and appeared in many other films , including `` DeathStalker , '' `` Blind Date , '' `` Scarface , '' `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High '' and the spoof `` Amazon Women on the Moon . '' She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood 's House of Blues at the time of her death . In the 2007 trial , Spector 's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38 - caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector 's home . But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace . Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms . His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home , pistol in hand , saying , `` I think I killed somebody . '' Spector 's retrial began in October . Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector . Spector 's professional trademark was the `` Wall of Sound , '' the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner , Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s . iReport.com : What do you think of this verdict ? The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called `` little symphonies for the kids '' -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes ' `` Be My Baby '' and the Righteous Brothers ' `` You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' . '' Spector co-produced the Beatles ' final album , `` Let It Be , '' and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up . His recording of Harrison 's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year . Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 , but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson 's death .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- A remake , a prequel , and one woefully misguided bird-watching comedy could n't take down Hugh Jackman and the robots of `` Real Steel '' at the box office this weekend . `` Steel '' punched up an estimated $ 16.3 million this weekend , marking a healthy 40 percent drop from its $ 27.3 million debut . As evidenced by the film 's impressive 64 percent boost on Saturday , it appears that `` Real Steel '' is playing as an outright family affair , and that sort of appeal will help it achieve small drops in the coming weeks . Still , the $ 110 million Dreamworks film , which is being distributed by Disney 's Touchstone Pictures , has a very long way to go before it 's in the black . So far , `` Real Steel '' has earned $ 51.7 million in ten days . Paramount 's $ 24 million remake `` Footloose '' managed to open in second place with $ 16.1 million , a rather lackluster result . Instead of playing like a hyped-up event movie , `` Footloose '' played much more like a typical dance flick . It attracted fewer dance fans than movies like `` Save the Last Dance '' -LRB- 2001 , $ 23.4 million opening -RRB- and `` Step Up '' -LRB- 2006 , $ 20.7 million opening -RRB- , but it performed on the same level as `` Step Up 3D '' -LRB- 2010 , $ 15.8 million opening -RRB- and `` You Got Served '' -LRB- 2004 , $ 16.1 million -RRB- . The film played best with women , who made up 75 percent of the audience , and older moviegoers , who composed 61 percent of the opening weekend crowd . `` Footloose '' earned a solid `` A '' CinemaScore grade , and strong word-of-mouth could help it dance its way out of financial trouble , but it will not be able to match the $ 80 million total that the original `` Footloose '' achieved back in 1984 . In third , Universal 's horror prequel `` The Thing '' did n't scare up many ticket sales this weekend , opening with $ 8.7 million . The film , which totes a reported $ 35 million budget , performed below Universal 's expectations , becoming the latest 2011 horror film to not connect with audiences . Movies like `` Scream 4 '' -LRB- $ 38.2 million total -RRB- , `` The Rite '' -LRB- $ 33 million -RRB- , and `` Priest '' -LRB- $ 29.1 million -RRB- have all struggled at the box office this year . Even `` Thing '' star Mary Elizabeth Winstead 's former franchise film , `` Final Destination 5 , '' performed unremarkably , earning only $ 42.1 million . The best comparison for `` The Thing '' is probably `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark , '' which opened with a similar $ 8.5 million and finished with $ 23.2 million . Considering `` The Thing '' earned a weak `` B - '' CinemaScore grade and a sad $ 2,990 per theater average , that total is about the best it can hope for . George Clooney 's political thriller `` The Ides of March '' held very well in its sophomore weekend , dipping only 28 percent to $ 7.5 million in fourth place . That decline is far less severe than Clooney 's other recent political flicks , `` The American '' and `` The Men Who Stare At Goats , '' which dropped by 57 and 54 percent in their second weekends , respectively . Perhaps Clooney has made a political movie that 's a bit more palatable for general audiences -- or perhaps it 's just the Ryan Gosling effect . Either way , after ten days , `` Ides , '' which cost Sony $ 12.5 million to produce , has earned $ 22.2 million . If it keeps up the soft declines , it could become a serious Oscar contender . `` Dolphin Tale '' spent one last weekend in the Top 5 , sliding 31 percent to $ 6.3 million . After four weekend 's Warner Brothers ' surprise 3-D hit has accrued a nice $ 58.7 million total . Along with `` Moneyball '' -LRB- $ 57.7 million after four weeks -RRB- and `` The Lion King 3D '' -LRB- $ 90.5 million after five -RRB- , `` Dolphin Tale '' is one of the few box office bright spots since `` The Help . '' The weekend 's other new wide release , `` The Big Year , '' debuted way back in ninth place with $ 3.3 million out of 2,150 theaters . Fox spent $ 41 million on the Jack Black , Steve Martin , Owen Wilson bird-watching collaboration that was n't quite a comedy , was n't quite a drama , was n't quite a competition film , and apparently was n't at all enticing for audiences , who gave the picture a `` B - '' CinemaScore grade . Between the financial failure of `` The Big Year , '' and 2006\u00e2 $ \u00b2 s `` Hoot , '' which opened to $ 3.4 million out of 3,018 theaters , maybe Hollywood should think twice about the appeal of birds at the box office . They do n't always soar . In limited release , Pedro Almodovar 's deeply creepy `` The Skin I Live In '' got off to a strong start , with $ 231,000 in six theaters , good for a robust $ 38,500 per theater average . Internationally , tastes were n't quite as refined , as `` The Smurfs '' finally passed $ 400 million overseas . 1 . Real Steel -- $ 16.3 mil 2 . Footloose -- $ 16.1 mil 3 .

{"answer":"United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Delegates from the United States and other nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a fiery speech that criticized Washington , capitalism and the world body itself . Though incendiary statements from Ahmadinejad are nothing new , tension in the hall grew as the Iranian leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on New York and Washington . `` Some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack , '' Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly . He followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing `` the declining American economy and its scripts on the Middle East in order to save the Zionist regime . The majority of the American people , as well as most nations and politicians around the world , agree with this view . '' That appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats . Representatives from the United States , Britain , Sweden , Australia , Belgium , Uruguay and Spain walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that U.S. government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq . President Barack Obama already had delivered his address to the General Assembly and had left the grounds before Ahmadinejad spoke . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president `` found the comments to be outrageous and offensive , given how close we are to ground zero , '' the New York site of the attacks . And Mark Kornblau , a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N. , said in a statement , `` Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people , Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable . '' A European Union diplomat said that all 27 member nations had agreed to walk out if Ahmadinejad made inflammatory statements during his address . The exits did not deter the Iranian leader from his line of attack , however . Ahmadinejad went on to compare the death toll in the September 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in Afghanistan in Iraq . `` It was said that some 3,000 people were killed on September 11th , for which we are all very saddened , '' he said . `` Yet , up until now in Afghanistan and Iraq , hundreds of thousands of people have been killed , millions wounded and displaced , and the conflict is still going on and expanding . '' Ahmadinejad also continued the attack on capitalism that he began during a Monday address at the Millennium Global Development Summit . He linked the U.S.-led conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with wars for colonial expansion in Africa , Latin America and Asia . The Iranian president also touched on the recent controversy over a Florida pastor 's plans to burn copies of the Quran , the Muslim holy book , by waving copies of a Bible and a Quran as he declared his respect and reverence for both . And he concluded his address with a defense of Iran 's nuclear ambitions , discussing a recently submitted statement to the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .

Jimena bears down Tuesday evening on Baja California , with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas in its path . Meanwhile , Tropical Storm Erika formed in the Atlantic on Tuesday , east of the northern Leeward Islands , the National Hurricane Center said . Jimena 's maximum wind speed dropped from 125 mph to 120 mph -LRB- 195 kph -RRB- , according to the U.S. National Weather Service 's 5 p.m. PT -LRB- 8 p.m. ET -RRB- update . `` A gradual weakening is forecast during the next 24 to 48 hours , '' the weather service said . `` However , Jimena could be near major hurricane strength when it makes landfall . '' The storm 's center is forecast to come ashore on Thursday morning , but the weather service warned that `` because it will be moving parallel to the coastline , any slight change in direction could have a huge impact in the location and timing of landfall . '' Mexico 's government extended a hurricane warning for most of the southern half of the Baja peninsula -- from Punta Abreojos on the peninsula 's west coast to Mulege on its east coast , according to the National Weather Service .

In addition to damaging winds , the storm could bring as much as 15 inches of rain , forecasters said . Jimena -- the 10th named storm of the Pacific season -- was centered about 85 miles -LRB- 135 km -RRB- west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas , according to the weather service .

The day before , airlines offered extra flights to leave the area . Lionel Alvarez , who runs a resort hotel called `` Las Ventanas al Pariaso '' in the town of San Jose del Cabo , found a silver lining to the coming storm . `` The wind is refreshing a little bit because of the high temperatures we 've gone through in the past few days , '' he said . But Alvarez , like other locals , had work to do in preparation of Jimena . `` We protect the property by dismantling all that could be dangerous , fly or can be broken , '' he said . Authorities had asked about 10,000 people to evacuate the area , but many had decided to wait out the storm .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prescription drug overdose is now the fastest-growing drug problem in the country , surpassing the number of people who overdosed during both the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the black tar heroin epidemic of the 1970s combined , the Obama administration says . The problem is so severe , the administration is releasing a plan to combat what it calls a crisis of epidemic proportions . `` The toll our nation 's prescription drug abuse epidemic has taken in communities nationwide is devastating , '' said Gil Kerlikowske , White House director of national drug control policy . `` We share a responsibility to protect our communities from the damage done by prescription drug abuse . '' According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy , in 2007 about 28,000 people died from drug overdoses . Most were accidental and were related to prescription drugs . `` Today , we are making an unprecedented commitment to combat the growing problem of prescription drug abuse , '' said Vice President Joe Biden as he announced the administration 's plan Tuesday morning . `` The government , as well as parents , patients , health care providers , and manufacturers all play a role in preventing abuse . This plan will save lives , and it will substantially lessen the burden this epidemic takes on our families , communities , and workforce . '' The effort , called `` Epidemic : Responding to America 's Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis , '' is primarily aimed at cracking down on abuse of opioids , some of the most powerful pain relievers on the market . Opioids are a class of drugs used to treat chronic pain and include products like OxyContin , Vicodin , Darvon , Dilaudid and Demerol . When abused they can be highly addictive . Prescriptions for these painkillers have increased dramatically over the past 10 years . In 2000 pharmacies filed 174 million opioid prescriptions . By 2009 that number was 257 million . According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , over the past five years , hospital emergency room visits linked to prescription drug abuse or misuse have doubled . `` Unintentional drug overdose is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and is now the leading cause of injury death in 17 states , '' said Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` There are effective and emerging strategies out there to address this problem . Support for this action plan will help us implement those strategies which will go a long way to save lives and reduce the tremendous burden this problem has on our health care system and our society . '' The plan seeks to reduce abuse and drug diversion , educate both parents and health care providers , find better ways to dispose of unused pills , and beef up enforcement efforts by clamping down on pill mills and doctor shopping . The Food and Drug Administration will provide support by requiring an opioids Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to determine that a drug 's benefits outweigh its risks . Under this process , drug manufacturers must make educational materials on proper prescribing and disposal available to anyone writing prescriptions for long-acting and extended-release painkillers . The agency must approve all materials before they are released . `` Long-acting and extended-release opioid drugs have benefit when used properly and are a necessary component of pain management for certain patients , but we know that they pose serious risks when used improperly , with serious negative consequences for individuals , families and communities , '' said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg . `` The prescriber education component of this opioid -LRB- risk evaluation and mitigation strategy -RRB- balances the need for continued access to these medications with stronger measures to reduce their risks . '' Thirty-five states already have prescription drug monitoring programs in place that help track how prescriptions are prescribed and distributed by authorized healthcare providers and pharmacies . The program 's main goal is to prevent abuse and diversion at the retail level . Under the new plan , agencies will work to establish prescription drug monitoring programs in every state . The Drug Enforcement Agency will be heavily involved in enforcement , recovering prescription drugs , and focusing on doctors who illegally prescribe and dispense these drugs . They will also target `` doctor shoppers '' -- people who visit multiple doctors to secure multiple prescriptions and pill mills . `` When abused , prescription drugs are just as dangerous and just as addictive as drugs like methamphetamine or heroin , '' DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said . `` The more we can do to stop the abuse of prescription drugs , the more effective we will be in reducing the death , destruction and despair that accompanies all drug abuse . '' A number of other federal agencies will also be involved in the effort , including the departments of Health and Human Services , Justice , Defense and Veterans Affairs .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as `` a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal health officials are expanding efforts to ensure no additional bacteria-tainted cantaloupes get to consumers in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness in more than a decade . The Food and Drug Administration said it has teamed up with state officials in the effort . `` FDA and its state partners are conducting checks at retail stores , wholesalers and distributors to make sure they have received notification about the Jensen Farms ' whole cantaloupe recall and that they have taken appropriate action to notify their customers and remove the recalled whole cantaloupes from the shelves , '' the agency said in a statement Wednesday . Thirteen people have died in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 , according to records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12 . It was traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms ' fields in Granada , Colorado . What you need to know about Listeria As of Monday , it had grown to 18 states , 72 illnesses and 13 deaths , according to the CDC 's latest statistics . `` Because some of the wholesalers and distributors may have further distributed the recalled cantaloupes to food processors , it is possible that additional products that contain cantaloupe from Jensen Farms could be recalled , '' the FDA said . `` There is no indication of foreign distribution at this time . '' In 1998 , 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs , according to a CDC database . Food poisoning 101 In the current outbreak , four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in New Mexico , two each in Colorado and Texas , and one each in Kansas , Maryland , Missouri , Nebraska , and Oklahoma . Public health officials also have reported illnesses in California , Florida , Illinois , Indiana , Montana , North Dakota , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wyoming . Listeria can grow even at low temperatures and can also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick , so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks , officials said . Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults , according to the CDC , but it is particularly dangerous for older adults , people with weakened immune systems . In pregnant women , it can cause miscarriages , stillbirth and premature delivery . Pregnant women may experience only mild flu-like symptoms , said Dr. David Acheson , a former chief medical officer for the FDA who is now the managing director for food and import safety practice at Leavitt Partners , a firm which advises clients on health care and food safety . Listeria can be devastating to a fetus , he said , particularly in the second or third trimesters , so pregnant women who may have been exposed and have any flu-like symptoms should see a doctor . Symptoms can be more pronounced in the elderly or those with compromised immune systems , he said . About 1,600 people become seriously ill because of the bacteria each year , the CDC reports , and about 260 die . How to keep your food safe","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Didier Drogba came off the bench to rescue a point for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi on Saturday to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . Didier Drogba scored for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . Ivory Coast needed only a point from their match with the bottom-placed team in African qualifying Group E but found themselves a goal down in the 64th minute when Jacob Ngwira put the hosts ahead at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre . Elephants coach Vahid Halilhodzic responded by throwing on Chelsea striker Drogba who was able to level the scores in the 67th minute . Malawi pushed for a winner as the second half wore on but were unable to add to the score and Ivory Coast secured the point they required for qualification . The result brought Ivory Coast 's 100 percent run in the group to an end but ensured they will feature in the World Cup Finals for a second time following their debut appearance in 2006 . Malawi also improved their chances of qualifying for the African Cup of Nations by moving third with four points , just behind Burkina Faso who have six and Guinea who are now last with three points . Elsewhere in the African qualifying zone Egypt recorded a 1-0 win over Zambia in their Group C clash in Konkola to potentially set up a deciding match with Algeria in Cairo next month . Egypt were on the back foot in the first half and were indebted to goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary who frustrated the Zambia fans with several fine saves as the visitors struggled to get to grips with the pitch at the Konkola Stadium . But the Pharaohs were a much-improved side after the half-time break and Hosny Abd-Rabou secured all three points with the only goal of the game in the 68th minute . Egypt defender Sayed Moawad laid off the ball for Abd-Rabou to fire a powerful right-footed shot past Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene and into the top corner of the net . The result means qualification will go right down to the wire even if Algeria take maximum points from their clash with bottom side Rwanda on Sunday and go three points clear of Egypt at the top of the group . Cameroon moved a step closer to qualification as they remained top of Group A with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Togo in Yaounde . The Indomitable Lions took the lead in the 32nd minute through Newcastle midfielder Geremi when he smashed home the rebound after Togo goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale had saved his initial shot from the penalty spot . Lyon 's Jean Makoun doubled the advantage two minutes after the interval after he tapped home following a mazy dribble by Samuel Eto'o and Achille Emana made the points safe in the 52nd minute with a low drive . Gabon remain a point behind Cameroon after they clinched a 3-1 win over Morocco in Libreville having taken the lead after Hicham Mahdoufi put through his own net moments before half-time . Eric Mouloungou and Daniel Cousin gave Gabon a three-goal lead before Adel Taarabt pulled one back for Morocco with a late consolation . Paul Le Guen 's Cameroon side , who had looked doubtful to qualify when he took over , are in pole position at the top of the group with 10 points ahead of Gabon on nine , Togo on five and Morocco with three .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gillette said Saturday it was `` limiting '' golfer Tiger Woods ' role in its marketing programs to give him the privacy he needs to work on family relationships after disclosures of his `` infidelity . '' In a statement , the Boston , Massachusetts-based body grooming company said it supports Woods ' decision to take `` an indefinite break '' from professional golf . On his Web site Friday , Woods admitted to infidelity and said he was taking a break from the sport to focus on his family . `` In the midst of a difficult and unfortunate situation , we respect the action Tiger is taking to restore the trust of his family , friends and fans , '' Gillette spokesman Mike Norton said in the statement . `` We fully support him stepping back from his professional career and taking the time he needs to do what matters most . We wish him and his family the best . `` As Tiger takes a break from the public eye , we will support his desire for privacy by limiting his role in our marketing programs , '' Norton said . Woods ' Friday posting said : `` After much soul searching , I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf . I need to focus my attention on being a better husband , father and person . '' `` I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people , most of all my wife and children , '' Woods ' statement said . `` I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness .

In the week following the crash , Woods apologized for `` transgressions '' that let his family down . The same day , US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs , a 24-year-old cocktail waitress . US Weekly 's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with New York nightclub hostess Rachel Uchitel , an assertion she vigorously denied , according to The New York Post . It was not immediately clear how Woods ' hiatus would affect his other sponsorships , which include Nike , Gatorade and Electronic Arts . `` He is the best golfer in the world and one of the greatest athletes of his era , '' Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in a statement . `` We look forward to his return to golf .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On his final full day in office , President Bush issued commutations for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant -- suspected of drug smuggling at the time -- and then covering it up . An artist 's sketch shows Ignacio Ramos , left , and Jose Compean . The prison sentences of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean will now end March 20 . Ramos had received an 11-year prison sentence ; Compean had received a 12-year term . They began serving their sentences in January 2007 . The Office of the Pardon Attorney was still reviewing the clemency request when Bush made his decision , Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said . `` The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they , and their families , have suffered enough for their crimes , '' a senior administration official said . `` Commuting their sentences does not diminish the seriousness of their crimes . Ramos and Compean are convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law and have been severely punished , '' the official stated . `` This commutation gives them an opportunity to return to their families and communities , but both men will have to carry the burden of being convicted felons and the shame of violating their oaths for the rest of their lives . '' The official noted that both Democratic and Republican members of Congress have supported a commutation , including President-elect Barack Obama 's incoming White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , and Texas GOP Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn . The head of the labor union representing Border Patrol agents told CNN Radio he was `` grateful '' that Bush commuted the sentences but questioned why the prison terms wo n't end until March 20 . `` I would be quite curious to learn why they have to wait another two months for an unjust sentence , '' said Rich Pierce , president of the National Border Patrol Council . He said the union 's ultimate goal would be for the men to get their Border Patrol jobs back . The shooting happened February 17 , 2005 , on the border southeast of El Paso , Texas . During their trial , Ramos and Compean said the illegal immigrant , Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila , had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest . Aldrete-Davila , however , said he was unarmed and was attempting to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun . Aldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande . Ramos and Compean were ultimately convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon , lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila 's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure . After receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents , Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States . The case quickly became a political flash point , with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila . Bush has granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations over his eight years in office , far fewer than Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in their two-term administrations . During the final months of the Bush administration , speculation has swirled around the question of whether former vice presidential aide Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby would be granted the presidential favor . Libby was convicted in March of 2007 of four counts of lying and impeding a federal investigation into the leak of information that revealed that Valerie Plame was a covert CIA operative . Among the more notable people who have applied for -- but not received -- some form of clemency are : former Rep. Randall `` Duke '' Cunningham , R-California , who was convicted of receiving bribes ; publishing executive Conrad Black , who was found guilty of fraud ; former junk bold salesman Michael Milken , who pleaded guilty to securities fraud ; and former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers , convicted of accounting fraud . The parents of John Walker Lindh , who was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty to supporting terrorists in Afghanistan , held a news conference in December urging Bush to commute their son 's sentence . There is a long tradition of presidents issuing pardons and commutations during their final days in office . Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich during his last hours in office , setting off a firestorm of controversy . A commutation reduces a convict 's prison term , but the conviction remains on the person 's record . A pardon , however , wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction . A president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses , although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person 's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release . Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans . E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals . Known as `` e-cigarettes , '' the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals , spiced with flavors such as chocolate , cola or bubble gum . While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a `` healthy way '' to smoke , federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user . `` The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public , '' said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg , commissioner of the FDA . CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere , one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes , after the FDA announcement , and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment . Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval , the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user . That is why the FDA began to test them . The FDA 's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes . In releasing its information , the FDA did not identify the two companies , but said in one sample , diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected . Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them , the FDA said . The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008 . To date , 50 shipments have been stopped . The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . `` We know very little about these devices , said Dr. Jonathan Samet , director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California , `` but to say they are healthy -- that 's highly doubtful . '' Samet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings . Dr. Jonathan Winickoff , chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium , said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes . `` It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations , or even enforce rules that they not be used , '' he said . `` Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products , '' said Dr. Matthew McKenna , director of the Office of Smoking and Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` It 's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general . '' The FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court . The FDA suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA 's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program either online , by regular mail , fax or phone . CNN 's Valerie Willingham contributed to this report .","question":""}

That would mean 260,000 to 540,000 barrels had leaked as of 10 days ago . The Exxon Valdez leaked about 250,000 barrels into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . The busted well is spewing oil at a rate of at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day , U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt told reporters Thursday . A barrel of oil has 42 gallons , so that 's 504,000 to 798,000 gallons a day . That 's more than twice as much as previous estimates , which put the rate at 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day . It 's also the more conservative estimate of two reached by two separate teams of government scientists who used two different methods , McNutt told reporters Thursday . One team looked at the oil on the surface and came up with the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day . A second team used a different method and came up with a range of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels per day , McNutt said . The official estimate uses the range where the estimates overlap . The lower end of the government estimate -- 12,000 barrels per day -- would mean that about 18.6 million gallons of oil has been spilled since the April 20 oil rig explosion that started the leak . The higher end -- 19,000 barrels per day -- would mean 29.5 million gallons has been spilled . The Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil . Worldwide , there have been more than a dozen bigger oil spills than the Gulf spill . The worst was the destruction of Kuwaiti terminals and tankers by Saddam Hussein 's forces during the 1991 Gulf war , which spilled 240 million gallons , according to the Oil Spill Intelligence Report . The amount of oil spilled could have very specific financial ramifications for BP . If the government finds the company negligent or the leak avoidable , BP will owe royalties on the lost oil , Minerals Management Service spokesman Nicholas Pardi told CNN . `` Now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the Gulf , '' said Jeremy Symons , senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation . `` BP has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions . It 's as if two Exxon Valdez tankers have already run aground , and more are on the way if they do n't get this hole plugged . `` This independent government estimate shows what we expected all along -- BP can not be trusted , because every gallon of oil that is spilled means they will pay more in fines and liability , '' Symons said . The estimates are preliminary and based on new methodologies , McNutt said in a teleconference . The first team , which got the lower estimate , analyzed how much oil was on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on a given date , using aerial imaging . They estimated that `` 130,000 to 270,000 barrels -LRB- were -RRB- on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on May 17 , '' McNutt said . `` We estimate that , in addition , as of May 17 a similar volume of oil had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated , '' she said . That led those scientists to the range of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day . The second group used video observations to arrive at the higher figure . The scientific teams were composed of federal scientists , independent experts and representatives from universities around the country , McNutt said . BP , which owns the well , was not involved except to provide raw data , she said .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week , a police spokesman said Wednesday . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero , but New York city officials said no . The controversial , outspoken president wanted to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said , citing Iranian officials . But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site , `` and it would not be possible for him to go where other people do n't go , '' Kelly told CNN . Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero , police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN . But , he said , `` If there were a further request , we 'd reject it '' because of security fears . Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader '' The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision , but in a statement issued Wednesday evening , it called the rejection `` unfortunate . '' Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda . Ahmadinejad 's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks , Mohammed Khatami , condemned them , and Tehran cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda 's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed . The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days . The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center , when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers . A third jet hit the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers . `` It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terror , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground , '' State Department spokesman Tom Casey said . Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit . Hillary Clinton , the New York senator and Democratic front-runner , called the request `` unacceptable . '' Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , a leading Republican , called it `` shockingly audacious . '' And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that `` under no circumstances '' should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site . Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the site should not be `` used as a photo op . '' Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad 's hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium . Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants , but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is `` very ill '' and has been hospitalized , according to Cambridge University , where he is a professor . Stephen Hawking in Pasadena , California , in March . Cambridge University said the 67-year-old is `` comfortable '' and will stay overnight at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge . Hawking , one of the world 's most famous physicists , is also a cosmologist , astronomer , and mathematician . Wheelchair-bound Hawking is perhaps most famous for `` A Brief History of Time , '' which explored the origins of the universe in layman 's terms . The book is considered a modern classic . Hawking has Lou Gehrig 's Disease -LRB- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , or ALS -RRB- , which is usually fatal after three years . Hawking has survived for more than 40 years since his diagnosis . On his Web site , Hawking has written about living with ALS . `` I try to lead as normal a life as possible , and not think about my condition , or regret the things it prevents me from doing , which are not that many , '' he wrote . He added : `` I have been lucky , that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case . But it shows that one need not lose hope . '' The disease has left him paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand . Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing , dressing , eating , even speech . He uses a speech synthesizer with an American accent . Hawking has been married and divorced twice . In 2004 , police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking 's daughter that his second wife was abusing him . Authorities said they found no proof . His Web site says he has three children and one grandchild . Hawking was born in Oxford , England , on what turned out to be an auspicious date : January 8 , 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei . A Cambridge University spokesman told CNN : `` Professor Hawking is very ill and has been taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital , Cambridge . '' Professor Peter Haynes , head of the university 's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics , said : `` Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague , we all hope he will be amongst us again soon . '' At Cambridge , he holds the position of Lucasian Professor Mathematics -- the prestigious post held from 1669 to 1702 by Sir Isaac Newton . Hawking has guest-starred , as himself , on Star Trek : The Next Generation and The Simpsons . He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe , his choice would be Marilyn . In October , CNN 's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking . The following are some quotes from that interview : `` Over the last twenty years , observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in ' A Brief History of Time . ' The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now , rather than slowing down ... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds . '' CNN 's Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus -LRB- HPV -RRB- has prompted a widespread freeze on the country 's national vaccination program . Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008 , the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers . More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service -LRB- NHS -RRB- started administering it in September 2008 . Natalie Morton 's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in Coventry . Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine , according to media reports . It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton 's death . Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death . Glaxo Smith Kline , the manufacturer of Cervarix , issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a `` precautionary measure . '' Watch reaction to Natalie Morton 's death '' `` At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown , '' the company said in a statement posted on their Web site . `` Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night , we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie 's death is conducted . '' On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations . `` As a purely precautionary measure , we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case , '' a spokesperson for the NHS said . `` Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches , they should continue with the vaccination program . '' Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine . What is HPV ? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus . Although there are more than 100 types of HPV , only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer . Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts . HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease . Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life , according to the British National Health Service . HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix . Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer . Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV . What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine ? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV -LRB- 16 and 18 -RRB- that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women . The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm , or thigh , in three doses within six months , and is recommended for teenage girls . How effective is the Cervarix vaccine ? According to the manufacturer , Glaxo Smith Kline , Cervarix is over 99 percent effective . Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV ? No . Gardisil , manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide . Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV -LRB- 16 , 18 , 6 and 11 -RRB- . Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions , such as genital warts . Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck . Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated , 32 deaths were reported , though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence . Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK ? According to the NHS , Cervarix , `` was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria . The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated . '' When was the vaccine introduced ? In September 2008 , England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13 , and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls . Do condoms protect against HPV ? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission , but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover . What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine ? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries , according to the NHS . The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site , nausea , a mild temperature , dizziness , diarrhea and muscle aches . In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as '' a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman convicted in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart pleaded guilty in the attempted kidnapping of Smart 's cousin a month later , court officials said Monday . In exchange for Wanda Barzee 's plea of guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping , prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart 's abduction , said Nancy Volmer , spokeswoman for Utah state courts . Barzee , 64 , pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in connection with Smart 's abduction . As part of that plea agreement , she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband , Brian David Mitchell , federal prosecutors have said . Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart , then 14 , at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family 's Salt Lake City home in June 2002 . Smart was found nine months later , walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy , Utah , in the company of Barzee and Mitchell , a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts ' home . The month after Smart was kidnapped , prosecutors alleged , Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin , but were unsuccessful . The girl was 15 years old at the time , according to CNN affiliate KSL . She is not named in court documents . `` Mr. Mitchell 's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened , which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee , '' the court documents said . Following her arrest in 2003 , Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl , and planned to hold her , along with Smart , in the couple 's camp in the mountains , according to court documents . Sentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge , Volmer said . Barzee faces between one and 15 years in prison , but prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence , according to court documents . Federal prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison for her in exchange for her cooperation against Mitchell . Federal sentencing was set for May 19 , but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee 's cooperation against Mitchell is complete . At the hearing in federal court , Barzee apologized to Smart , according to a transcript . `` I 'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it , '' she said . `` I 'm so sorry , Elizabeth , for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family . It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day . '' Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell 's . After years of being declared incompetent , she recently was declared competent to stand trial , according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper . A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated , and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple , the Tribune said . At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October , Smart , now 21 , testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California . Just after her abduction , Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her , she said . During the nine months of her captivity , Smart testified , no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell . U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has not yet ruled on Mitchell 's competency . State court proceedings are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. government has charged an international arms dealer with conspiring to sell a rebel group millions of dollars in weapons `` to be used to kill Americans in Colombia , '' federal prosecutors announced Tuesday . Viktor Bout is accused of selling missiles , rockets and other weapons to FARC , a Colombian rebel group . Viktor Bout , who was recently captured in Thailand , had agreed to sell the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -LRB- FARC -RRB- surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , `` ultralight '' airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release . There was no immediate public response from Bout , who remains in custody in Thailand . Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals , conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . FARC is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department . Justice Department officials said they are seeking Bout 's extradition to the United States . The indictment alleges that Bout made agreements with FARC between November 2007 and March of this year . In their news release , federal prosecutors said Bout agreed to sell weapons `` to two confidential sources '' working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , who had `` represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the FARC , with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack United States helicopters in Colombia . '' The news release also refers to a `` covertly recorded meeting in Thailand on March 6 , 2008 . '' `` With the unsealing of this indictment , we are one step closer to ensuring Bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist , '' DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Loenhart said in the news release . Attorney General Michael Mukasey last month singled out Bout as a leading example of a new breed of organized crime leaders who operate across international boundaries to amass wealth without regard to political ideology . `` Viktor Bout has long been considered by the international community as one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , '' U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in the news release Tuesday . Bout 's assets in the United States were frozen in 2004 after he allegedly shipped weapons to Liberia in violation of U.S. government restrictions .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Syrian arms dealer was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to sell weapons as part of a plot to kill Americans in Colombia , according to prosecutors . Syrian-born arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar , seen in a file photo , tried to sell weapons to undercover U.S. agents . Monzer al-Kassar was also ordered Tuesday to forfeit all of his assets , according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York . Al-Kassar 's co-defendant Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy received a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the conspiracy . Both men were convicted in November of five charges , including conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals , conspiracy to acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles , conspiracy to provide support for FARC guerrillas in Colombia , and money laundering . The federal indictment paints al-Kassar as an international arms dealer with a hand in conflicts in nearly every part of the world , with a web of bank accounts and front companies across Europe and the Middle East . Al-Kassar was arrested in Spain in 2007 on a U.S. warrant and his associate Moreno Godoy was arrested in Romania . Both were extradited to the United States . The arrests stemmed from an undercover sting operation involving U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posing as members of FARC . During the 16-month operation , the agents arranged to buy more than 12,000 weapons from the two men , according to the indictment . Al-Kassar agreed to provide surface-to-air missiles for the FARC to shoot down American helicopters , and also offered to send 1,000 men to fight with the FARC , plus explosives and men who could train the FARC in how to use them , the indictment charged . Al-Kassar demanded 3,500,000 euros -LRB- $ 4.4 million -RRB- as `` partial payment '' for the weapons , it said . Justice Department officials say al-Kassar has been a source of weapons and military equipment for armed combatants since the 1970s . Kassar had told journalists before he was arrested that he had retired from arms dealing , but the United States says he had been involved since the 1970s , providing weapons and military equipment to armed factions in Nicaragua , Cyprus , Bosnia , Croatia , Iran , Iraq , Somalia , and elsewhere .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Carolina State University women 's basketball coach Kay Yow , who won more than 700 games in nearly four decades of coaching , died Saturday after a long struggle with breast cancer , the university said . North Carolina State University 's Kay Yow , in 1996 , was one of only six coaches to amass 700 wins . She was 66 . Yow , who was in her 38th season as a coach , had amassed numerous awards , including inductions into the Women 's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame . In her 34 years on the sidelines for the Wolfpack , her teams won four Atlantic Coast Conference titles , averaged 20 wins a season , appeared in 20 of 27 NCAA tournaments and reached the Final Four in 1998 . She was one of only six coaches in the women 's game to win at least 700 games , the university said . She also coached the 1988 women 's Olympic basketball team to a gold medal in Seoul , South Korea . Yow was beloved by her players , colleagues and fans , and in 2007 , N.C. State christened the court in Raleigh 's Reynolds Coliseum in her name . Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987 , Yow had been active in efforts to raise awareness and money to battle the disease , which forced her to miss two games during the 2004-05 season and another 16 in the 2006-07 season , the university said . She helped establish the Kay Yow\/WBCA Cancer Fund , which raised money for the cause . About three weeks ago , Yow announced that she was stepping away from coaching duties for the remainder of the 2008-09 season , after missing four straight games because of an extremely low energy level . `` Stepping away from coaching is one of the hardest decisions I have had to make , '' Yow said January 6 , according to N.C.

{"answer":"Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Saddam Hussein 's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- also known as Chemical Ali -- was executed Monday , an Iraqi government spokesman said . He was hanged after having been convicted on 13 counts of killings and genocide , Ali al-Dabagh said . Al-Majeed had been sentenced to death in four separate trials , including one that focused on his involvement in a poison gas attack against Iraqi Kurds that killed about 5,000 people . His execution had been delayed for political rather than legal reasons . It is not clear what change , if any , led to the reported execution . Al-Majeed had been held in United States custody since his capture in 2003 . But he was handed over to the Iraqi authorities in the 24 hours before his execution , U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill told CNN 's Diana Magnay on Monday . The 1988 poison gas attack on the village of Halabja , which earned al-Majeed his nickname , was part of the Anfal campaign , in which the Hussein regime killed at least 100,000 Iraqi Kurds . The campaign is believed to be worst poison gas attack on civilians ever . Al-Majeed was sentenced to death separately for his role in putting down a Shiite uprising against Hussein in 1991 , and for his part in putting down a Baghdad revolt in 1999 . Estimates of the Shiite death toll in the 1991 rebellion range from 20,000 to 100,000 . Al-Majeed was convicted of playing a key part in the slaughter during the revolt in southern Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War . One of his co-defendants in the Anfal case , Sultan Hashem , is a prominent Sunni leader who is considered a key player in efforts to reconcile the country 's once-dominant Sunni community with the Shiite majority that now wields political power . Hashem was also sentenced to death , but Iraq 's Sunni Arab Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi has long refused to sign his execution order . That delayed the execution of al-Majeed and another defendant as well . Iraqi law requires all three members of the Iraqi presidency council -- the president and two vice-presidents -- to sign execution orders . It does not say what happens if they do not sign .

{"answer":"-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- It 's Nobel Prize announcement week , and if you had Carol W. Greider , Elizabeth Blackburn , or Jack Szostak in your office pool , you 're off to a good start -LRB- the trio will share this year 's Nobel Prize in Medicine -RRB- . As we await news of the rest of the winners , here are some stories about past Nobel laureates . Nobel Prize winners receive a medal and a cash award . 1 . Robert Lucas , winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the theory of `` rational expectations , '' split his $ 1 million prize with his ex-wife . If there were a Nobel Prize for Foresight or Timing , she should be nominated , based on a clause in their divorce settlement from seven years earlier : `` Wife shall receive 50 percent of any Nobel Prize . '' The clause expired on October 31 , 1995 . Had Lucas won any year after , he would have kept the whole million . 2 . Physicist Lise Meitner , whose work helped lead to the discovery of nuclear fission , was reportedly nominated for the Nobel Prize 13 times without ever winning -LRB- though nominations are kept secret , so we do n't know for sure -RRB- . This makes her the Dynasty of the Nobel Prize scene -- that show was nominated for 24 Emmy Awards but never won . Other analogies we 'd accept : The Color Purple -LRB- 11 Oscar nominations in 1985 , no wins -RRB- , the Buffalo Bills or Minnesota Vikings -LRB- 4 Super Bowl losses each without a victory -RRB- and William Jennings Bryan -LRB- three-time Democratic nominee for President , losing twice to McKinley and once to Taft . -RRB- 3 . People who refused the prize : \u2022 Le Duc Tho was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with Henry Kissinger for their roles in brokering a Vietnam cease fire at the Paris Peace Accords . Citing the absence of actual peace in Vietnam , Tho declined to accept . \u2022 Jean Paul Sartre waved off the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature . His explanation : `` It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre , Nobel Prize winner . A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution , even if it takes place in the most honorable form . '' \u2022 Afraid of Soviet retribution if he traveled to Stockholm to claim his prize , Boris Pasternak declined to accept the 1958 Prize in Literature , which he 'd earned for Doctor Zhivago .

{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday he sees no change in U.S. policy toward Iran despite the U.S. promise of a `` new beginning . '' Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would change its policy when the U.S. did so as well . Khamenei said a change in rhetoric is not enough , and Washington must practice what it preaches , according to the English-language Press TV channel in Iran . He also promised that Iran will change its policy if the United States does so as well , Press TV reported . Khamenei 's comments , which he made in a televised address to mark the start of the Iranian New Year on Friday , come a day after U.S. President Barack Obama reached out to Iran in a videotaped message . A spokesman for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemned U.S. foreign policy Friday in response to the video . Obama 's message spoke of `` new beginnings '' with the promise of a new year . `` My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States , Iran and the international community , '' the president said in his message Friday . Obama said the United States seeks engagement with Iran that is `` honest and grounded in mutual respect . '' The president 's message is part of a dramatic shift in tone from that of the Bush administration , which branded Iran as part of an `` axis of evil '' along with North Korea and Iraq . It also echoes Obama 's inaugural speech in which he told the Muslim world , `` We seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . '' Ahmadinejad said last month that Iran would welcome talks with the United States `` in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect . '' Khamenei also said world powers have come to realize they are not able to block Iran 's nuclear progress . He looked back on the February 25 testing of Iran 's first nuclear power plant , at Bushehr , as one of the `` joyful developments '' of the past year . Last month , the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report saying that Iran has reached `` nuclear weapons breakout capability '' -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb . The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency . However , an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data , saying Iran 's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material . That has n't been done , the official said . The United States has had tortuous relations with Tehran since the Islamic revolution in 1979 . Meanwhile , the widow of the late founder of the Islamic Republic , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , died Saturday morning after a long period of illness , the Iranian-run Islamic Republic News Agency said . A funeral for Khadije Saghafi was scheduled to be held Sunday in Tehran and she was set to be laid to rest in Khomeini 's tomb , the agency reported . Khomeini was the leader of the 1979 revolution that led to the toppling of the shah of Iran and the ushering in of an Islamic state . He died in 1989 .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Boys may soon be able to get Gardasil , the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus . Gardasil , a vaccine against human papillomavirus , would be given to boys exactly as it is to girls . A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted Wednesday to recommend that the vaccine be made available to boys and young men aged 9 to 26 for protection against genital warts caused by HPV . The vaccine protects against four types of HPV , and two of those are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical and anal cancers , and HPV-associated penile and throat-and-neck cancers . The other two cause 90 percent of genital warts cases , researchers say . At Wednesday 's advisory committee meeting , pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. , maker of Gardasil , presented data from three clinical trials that the company claims supports broadening the distribution of the vaccine to include males . The trials included more than 5,400 boys and men from six continents and 23 countries . According to Anna Giuliano , an independent scientist at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa , Florida , and the trials ' principal investigator , `` The data clearly demonstrates that there was a benefit to men in receiving Gardasil . Overall , we saw a 90 percent reduction in disease -- genital warts and pre-cancerous lesions -- caused by HPV in men and an 89 percent reduction in genital warts incidence . `` Essentially , we have a really fantastic opportunity to extend the benefit of the vaccine to men , '' Giuliano said . `` This is a sexually transmitted infection ; if we can reduce infection and related diseases in men , we have the potential to have a much broader public health impact by reducing the overall burden of infection and disease in the community at large . '' Giuliano said there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine . There were some minor side effects such as pain at the injection site and low-grade fever . The vaccine would be administered in boys and young men exactly as it 's been given to girls and young women : three doses over a period of six months . Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said the cost will be $ 130 per dose . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , about 20 million Americans are infected with HPV . There are 6.2 million new infections each year . The CDC says that at least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get an HPV infection at some time in their life . The American Social Health Association says HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus and puts that number at 75 percent or more . The CDC says that although HPV is very common in both sexes , most men wo n't develop symptoms or serious health problems , and there is no test to detect the virus in men . The only approved HPV test on the market is for women , for use in cervical-cancer screening . The advisory committee also voted that Cervarix , a new HPV vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline , appeared to be safe and effective for girls and young women 10 to 25 years of age . Cervarix has been approved in Europe . `` This is an important step in cancer prevention for the millions of girls and young women at risk for cervical cancer , '' said Barbara Howe , vice president and director of North American vaccine development for GlaxoSmithKline . `` If approved , Cervarix will provide protection against cervical cancer , a devastating disease that is responsible for thousands of deaths in U.S. women each year . '' Still , the panel recommended that Glaxo do more studies that would monitor miscarriages and other problems reported by patients . In a final review , both applications will be considered by the FDA , which usually -- but not always -- follows the recommendations of its advisory committees .","question":""}
{"answer":"A whopping 70 percent of American kids are n't getting enough vitamin D , and such youngsters tend to have higher blood pressure and lower levels of good cholesterol than their peers , according to two new studies published this week in the journal Pediatrics . Low vitamin D levels also may increase a child 's risk of developing heart disease later in life , experts say . People who drank milk less than once a week were among those most at risk for vitamin-D deficiency , a study found . `` We were astounded at how common it was , '' says study author Dr. Michal Melamed , an assistant professor of medicine , epidemiology , and population health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , in the Bronx , New York . `` There is a lot of data that suggests adults with low vitamin-D levels are at risk for diabetes , high blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , and a lot of cancers , and if kids start out with low levels and never increase them , they may be putting themselves at risk for developing all of these diseases at a much earlier age . '' Vitamin D is often called the `` sunshine vitamin '' because the human body makes it only when exposed to sunlight -- although it only takes 10 to 15 minutes a day to make an adequate amount . Vitamin D , which helps the bones better absorb calcium , is also added to multivitamins and milk . In Melamed 's study , the researchers looked at the vitamin D levels of more than 6,000 people ages 1 to 21 . They checked for vitamin-D deficiency , which is defined as less than 15 nanograms per milliliter of blood -LRB- ng\/mL -RRB- , and vitamin-D insufficiency , which is defined as 15 to 29 ng\/mL . Overall , 7.6 million , or 9 percent , of U.S. children were vitamin-D deficient , and another 50.8 million , or 61 percent , had insufficient levels of this important vitamin in their blood . Children with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to have high blood pressure and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein , also known as good cholesterol -- two factors that are considered major risk factors for heart disease later in life . Health.com : How cholesterol affects your heart 's health Children with low vitamin-D levels also had higher levels of parathyroid hormone than their counterparts with adequate vitamin D in their blood .

They were also more likely to be children with darker skin , including non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans . -LRB- Children with darker skin are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D because they have more melanin than their fairer counterparts .

Health.com : Why belly fat increases type 2 diabetes risk The best vitamin-D boosting strategy involves a three-pronged approach , says Melamed . `` You can get a little bit from food , but not as much as you need , '' she says . `` Supplements are readily available , and kids like to take Flintstones or gummy-bear multivitamins , which typically contain vitamin D. '' Also , parents should help their children get at least 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure daily without sunscreen . `` Set your watch and then apply sunscreen after 15 minutes , '' Melamed says . Some children , including those in high-risk groups , may need to be screened to check for low vitamin-D levels . Dr. Michael F.

{"answer":"CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich vowed Friday to fight federal corruption charges and stay on the job , despite calls for his resignation amid allegations that he attempted to sell President-elect Barack Obama 's former Senate seat . Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich spoke to reporters at a news conference Friday but did not take questions . `` I will fight , I will fight , I will fight until I take my last breath . I have done nothing wrong , '' Blagojevich said in a brief news conference in Chicago . `` I 'm not going to quit a job that people have hired me to do . '' The spirited comments were the first public statements from the second-term governor about the allegations since his arrest December 9 on federal corruption charges . Federal prosecutors have accused the governor of trying to sell Obama 's former Senate seat . Prosecutors also allege the governor and his former chief of staff , John Harris , tried to have Chicago Tribune editorial board members fired by leveraging state assistance to the parent company of the newspaper , the Tribune Co. , in its sale of Wrigley Field . Blagojevich said he was `` dying '' to show his innocence , but maintained he would reserve his comments for an appropriate forum . `` I 'm not going to do what my accusers and political enemies have been doing , and that is talk about this case in 30-second sound bites on ` Meet the Press ' or on the TV news , '' he said . `` I have on my side the most powerful ally there is , and it is the truth .

Omar is expected to continue gathering strength as it passes east of the Virgin Islands in the next few hours and makes its way to the northern Leeward Islands Thursday morning , the hurricane center said . At 11 p.m. , Omar was moving northeast at about 20 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph . The hurricane 's center was about 30 miles -LRB- 45 km -RRB- southwest of St. Croix and about 105 miles -LRB- 165 km -RRB- southwest of St. Martin . A hurricane warning -- meaning winds of 74 mph and higher are expected within a day -- is in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands , the islands of Vieques , Culebra , St. Martin , Saba , St. Eustatius , St. Barthelemy , the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla . See where Omar is headed '' Puerto Rico is under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch , as are St. Kitts and Nevis , the hurricane center said .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A visit to the Eiffel Tower , the Statue of Liberty and the Pyramids is on the itinerary of most jet-setting travelers . Visiting the Eiffel Tower was voted the most overrated experience by tourists . But some of the most famous and iconic tourist attractions in the world are the most disappointing to actually visit , according to a survey of British tourists . And those questioned did n't think too highly of their own country 's best-known landmarks either , with Big Ben , Buckingham Palace and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain also turning people cold . Travel expert Felice Hardy explained why many tourists , often after spending inflated amounts on reaching and then viewing the most famous places , are left with a feeling of anti-climax . `` It 's easy to be swayed by brochures that opt for the mainstream and focus on clich\u00e9d tourist sights around the world , '' she said . `` But many of them are overcrowded and disappointing . `` Pick carefully and do n't always go for the obvious . Natural phenomena are usually more exciting than the man-made , and can be wonderfully free of tourists . '' The Eiffel Tower -- described by Hardy as `` frustratingly overcrowded and overpriced '' -- was dubbed the most disappointing international sight . Britain 's biggest letdown was Stonehenge , a sacred Druid sight in the rural south of England , which was dismissed as `` an isolated pile of rocks in a usually muddy field '' by Hardy . The Diana fountain resembled `` a colorless wet skateboard park '' while as far as Big Ben was concerned : `` Once you 've seen it , you 'll know what time it is -- time to go somewhere else . '' Three of America 's most famous sights -- New York 's Times Square and Statue of Liberty plus The White House in Washington also made the list of shame . But the 1,267 adults questioned by Virgin Travel Insurance also nominated the best places to visit in the world , with the Treasury in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan topping the list .

{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rapper Kanye West and his business manager face vandalism , battery and grand theft charges in connection with a scuffle with photographers at Los Angeles International Airport last September . Rapper Kanye West has been charged after an incident last year involving two photographers . The Los Angeles County district attorney declined to file felony charges , but L.A. City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo decided to charge West , 31 , and Don Crawley , 33 , with misdemeanors Wednesday . Police arrested West on September 11 , 2008 , after an altercation with two paparazzi , airport police said . The incident , which took place near the airport 's Terminal 4 , occurred between the rap star and Crawley -- his road manager and bodyguard -- and a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos , airport police said . The cameras of the paparazzi were damaged in the altercation , police said . West was charged with one count of vandalism , one count of grand theft and one count of battery , according to Frank Mateljan , the spokesman for the city attorney . Crawley was charged with two counts of vandalism , two counts of grand theft and two counts of battery , Mateljan said . If convicted of all charges , West could face up to two years and six months in jail , while Crawley could face up to five years , he said . Their arraignment hearing is set for April 14 at the Los Angeles Airport Courthouse , he said . West , a 10-time Grammy winner , and Crawley were in the airport to catch a flight to Honolulu , Hawaii , police said . The pair were outside of passenger security screening when the incident occurred . CNN could not immediately reach the star 's publicist for comment . The celebrity Web site TMZ posted a video of the incident shot by one of its reporters , who was also in the terminal when the altercation occurred . The video was short and chaotic , and the man whom TMZ identifies as West never shows his face , which is shrouded in the hood of a gray sweatshirt . According to the Web site , after West grabbed the camera from the photographer , Crawley took it from him , leaving the rap star with the lighting component . The video shows the man in the gray sweatshirt and another man in a red sweatshirt -- whom TMZ identifies as Crawley -- each smashing parts of a camera on the ground . Then the man in red approaches the camera as it is filming . He reaches out for the camera , and it appears a struggle ensues . As airport officials arrive , the man walks off . TMZ reported that after the incident with the first photographer , Crawley grabbed the TMZ reporter 's camera and allegedly broke it . Police stopped West and Crawley as they tried to leave to go through security to board the plane , the Web site said . TMZ is partly owned by AOL , part of CNN 's parent company , Time Warner . West quickly became a hip-hop star after his first album , `` College Dropout , '' debuted in 2004 , earning him a best rap album Grammy that year . He twice matched that feat with 2005 's `` Late Registration '' and 2007 's `` Graduation . '' West also has won three best rap song Grammys for his hits `` Jesus Walks , '' `` Diamonds from Sierra Leone '' and `` Good Life . '' His other four Grammys include two best rap solo performance awards , one for best rap performance by a duo or group , and one for best R&B song for his role in helping write `` You Do n't Know My Name , '' a song performed by Alicia Keys . The platinum rapper is also known for controversial outbursts , most notably in 2005 , when he went off script during an NBC telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina , saying , `` George Bush does n't care about black people .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Foreign nationals who are HIV-positive will find it easier starting Monday to visit the United States . The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed HIV infection from the list of diseases that prevent non-U.S. citizens from entering the country . HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus -- the virus that causes AIDS . Advocates for HIV-positive people said the new policy was long overdue , calling it `` a significant step forward for the United States . '' `` The end of the HIV travel and immigration ban is the beginning of a new life for countless families and thousands who had been separated because of this policy , '' said Steve Ralls , spokesman for Immigration Equality , a national rights organization for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and HIV-positive individuals . `` This is a new beginning for them . '' The final rule was approved in November and went into effect Monday . The new regulation takes HIV infection out of the category of `` communicable diseases of public health significance , '' the CDC said . It also removes required testing for HIV infection from the U.S. immigration medical screening process and eliminates the need for a waiver for entry into the United States . U.S. laws and regulations enacted since 1952 have made persons `` who were afflicted with any dangerous contagious disease '' ineligible to receive a visa to enter the country . People infected with HIV have been restricted since 1987 , when Congress directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to add HIV to its list of diseases of public health significance . The United States Global Leadership Against HIV\/AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 , which President Bush signed on July 30 , 2008 , removed the statutory requirement that mandated the inclusion of HIV on the list of diseases of public health significance that barred entry in the United States . The legislation did not , however , automatically change the existing regulations , administered by HHS , that continued to list HIV as a `` communicable disease of public-health significance '' and required the more cumbersome visa process . The United States was one of 13 countries that restricted entry of HIV-positive visitors , according to amfAR , an AIDS research foundation .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Robin van Persie hat-trick earned Arsenal a thrilling 5-3 win over their west London rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Saturday . Chelsea started the match strongly taking the lead in the 14th minute when Juan Mata delivered an inch-perfect cross for Frank Lampard to guide a header past Szczesny in the Arsenal goal . The home side continued to dominate possession but Arsenal hit back in the 36th minute when Aaron Ramsey threaded the ball through to Gervinho who selflessly squared the ball back for van Persie to side-foot past Petr Cech . Chelsea had a goal disallowed two minutes later with Ramires being ruled offside , but earned a deserved halftime lead when John Terry bundled the ball home from a corner kick in the 45th minute . Arsenal were far from finished though and hit back four minutes after the break as Alex Song played in Andre Santos who squeezed a shot underneath Cech to level the scores at 2-2 . Six minutes later , Theo Walcott gave the Gunners the lead -- unleashing a fierce shot inside Cech 's near post after outwitting three Chelsea defenders . A 25-yard strike from Mata restored parity for Chelsea in the 80th minute , but van Persie put Arsenal ahead again five minutes later , pouncing on a mistake by John Terry to slot home his second before lashing home his third in injury time to seal a remarkable win . Manchester United bounced back from the 6-1 battering from their city rivals last weekend edging past Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park . Havier Hernandez was on hand to side-foot home from a Patrice Evra cross in the 19th minute to give United the lead after they had made a bright opening to the match . Everton battled their way back into the match and came close to an equalizer -- Leighton Baines hitting the crossbar from a free-kick , while David De Gea saved smartly from Leon Osman . But despite the pressure , United held firm to cement second place in the table behind leaders , Manchester City who enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers . Edin Dzeko opened the scoring for City in the 52nd minute with Aleksandar Kolarov adding a second 15 minutes later . City 's Belgian defender Vincent Kompany was sent off in the 75th minute for a challenge on Kevin Doyle -- the resulting penalty was converted by Stephen Hunt . But Adam Johnson -LRB- who came on for Dzeko midway through the second half -RRB- netted in injury time to ensure Robert Mancini 's side maintained their five-point lead at the top of the table . First half goals from Charlie Adam and Andy Carroll proved enough for Liverpool who beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at The Hawthorns . Liverpool were awarded a penalty in the 9th minute when Luis Suarez was bundled over in the box -- Adam making no mistake with the spot kick . Suarez was involved again in the second , setting up Carroll who poked a shot past advancing West Brom keeper Ben Foster . Despite a host of chances in the second half Liverpool could n't extend their lead , but the win lifts them to fifth . West Brom are 13th with 11 points . Norwich City came from two goals down to earn a 3-3 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers -- a result which keeps Steve Kean 's side in the bottom three . Norwich are in eighth place .

{"answer":"BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut , killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders , according to American and Lebanese officials . Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut . The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries , and the sole passenger walked away unscathed , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said . Both were Lebanese nationals , he said . An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries , the spokesman said . Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut 's Dora area , contradicting earlier reports of four . Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion , which was caused by a 15-kilogram -LRB- 33-pound -RRB- bomb placed in a car before the explosion , the security forces said . The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack , said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia . `` I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded , and certainly to the families of those who were killed , that our condolences are with them , '' she added . It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb . A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack , and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy . But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target . `` We do n't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened , who is responsible , who is exactly being targeted , '' he told reporters during the State Department 's daily briefing . `` We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us . '' Citing security concerns , McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman . A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night `` out of respect to the victims of today 's terrorist explosion . '' In addition to the American , an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast , according to a Western diplomatic source . Video of the scene showed several damaged cars , including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal . A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage . Mohammed Chatah , senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , pointed out that the attack happened during `` a major political crisis '' in Lebanon , which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud . `` This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation , '' Chatah told CNN . Tuesday 's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western , anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital . Most recently , an explosion in Beirut 's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj , the head of operations for the Lebanese army , and his bodyguard on December 12 . Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president . Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president . The nation has been without a president since November 23 , when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term . In February 2005 , the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. soldier convicted of rape and murder two decades ago will be executed December 10 in the nation 's first military execution since 1961 , the Army said Thursday . Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , since 1988 . A court-martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville , North Carolina , area , and sentenced him to death . Gray 's execution by injection will be carried out by Fort Leavenworth soldiers at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute , Indiana , the Army said in a news release . Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg . He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post . Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes , which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987 . Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms . The general court-martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes . In July , President George W. Bush approved the Army 's request to execute Gray . `` The president took action following completion of a full appellate process , which upheld the conviction and sentence to death , '' the Army said in the news release . `` Two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied during the appellate processing of Pvt. Gray 's case . '' Members of the U.S. military have been executed throughout history , but just 10 have been executed with presidential approval since 1951 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , the military 's modern-day legal system .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three more members of a polygamous sect led by Warren Jeffs are facing sexual assault charges , Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said Tuesday . The latest charges come two months after Warren Jeffs and five followers were indicted in Texas . On Tuesday , a Texas grand jury indicted the three male members of Jeffs ' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints compound outside Eldorado , Abbott said . Each faces one felony count of sexual assault of a child . Two of them also face felony bigamy charges . The identities of the men were not released because they had not been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon . In July , the Schleicher County grand jury indicted Jeffs and four of his Texas FLDS followers on child sexual assault charges . Jeffs was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17 . A fifth follower was charged with failure to report child abuse . The charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch . In April , child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound , citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse . After a court battle , the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June , saying that the state had no right to remove them and that there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch . Jeffs , 52 , is the leader and `` prophet '' of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS , an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church . The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line : Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona . Jeffs , who is facing a sentence in Utah of up to life in prison and is awaiting trial in Arizona , could face another life sentence in Texas if convicted on the latest charge . In Utah , he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old . He faces similar charges in Arizona . His attorney in Arizona , Michael Piccarreta , has questioned the motives of Texas authorities . He said in July that the state 's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort `` to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday that he wo n't push to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center during his visit to the United Nations next week . Iran 's president said he wanted to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks . The controversial leader asked to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks , but New York city officials on Wednesday denied that request , citing safety concerns at what is now a construction site . Ahmadinejad said he would try to visit the site `` if we have the time and the conditions are conducive . '' But if local officials can not make the proper arrangements , `` I wo n't insist , '' he said in an interview to be aired Sunday on CBS ' `` 60 Minutes . '' The Bush administration considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism , and State Department spokesman Tom Casey called the request `` the height of hypocrisy . '' CBS correspondent Scott Pelley told Ahmadinejad he `` must have known that visiting the World Trade Center site would infuriate many Americans . '' `` Well , I 'm amazed , '' he said , surprised by the question . `` How can you speak for the whole of the American nation ? The American nation is made up of 300 million people . There are different points of view over there . '' More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center , when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers . A third jet hit the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers . Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda . Ahmadinejad 's predecessor , Mohammed Khatami , condemned the attacks and cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda 's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed . But the United States calls Iran the world 's top state sponsor of terrorism because of its support of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah and other militant groups . Washington and Tehran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days . The Bush administration has also accused Iran of meddling in Iraq and Afghanistan , where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . It accuses Iran of supplying advanced explosives to Shiite Muslim militias , some of which have used the devices against U.S. troops . Ahmadinejad also has drawn fire for his hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy international demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium . Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants , but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to create a nuclear bomb . The Iranian leader has made statements suggesting that Israel be politically `` wiped off the map , '' though he insists that can be accomplished without violence . He has questioned the existence of the Holocaust , the genocidal Nazi campaign against European Jews , and warned Europeans that they may pay a heavy price for its support of Israel . Ahmadinejad is also slated to speak on the campus of Columbia University during his visit , university President Lee Bollinger said . His presence is likely to spark protests on and off campus . Bollinger said the appearance is part of the World Leaders Forum -- an annual university event `` intended to further Columbia 's long-standing tradition of serving as a major forum for robust debate .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Vick turned himself in to authorities on Monday to get a head start on serving his sentence for running a dogfighting ring , the U.S. Marshals Service said . Michael Vick leaves court in Richmond , Virginia , in August after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges . The Atlanta Falcons quarterback is scheduled to be sentenced on December 10 on a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling the dogfighting operation . Vick , 27 , voluntarily turned himself in around noon , said Kevin Trevillan of the Marshals Service , and is being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw , Virginia , until the sentencing hearing . The quarterback , who has been suspended indefinitely by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge . Vick pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors . `` From the beginning , Mr. Vick has accepted responsibility for his actions and his self-surrender further demonstrates that acceptance , '' Vick 's attorney , Billy Martin , said in a statement . `` Michael wants to again apologize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time , '' Martin 's statement said . CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Vick started his sentence early `` to get it out of the way . '' Watch Toobin explain why Vick would surrender early '' On September 25 , a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants -- Purnell Peace , 35 , of Virginia Beach , Virginia ; Quanis Phillips , 28 , of Atlanta , Georgia ; and Tony Taylor , 34 , of Hampton , Virginia -- on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at Vick 's home outside Newport News . The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against the four men : one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights . Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term . In addition , Taylor faces three additional counts of unlawful torture and killing of dogs . A hearing in that case is set for November 27 , but Vick does not have to be in court at that time . In September , Vick was put under tight restrictions by the federal court after he tested positive for marijuana use . Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13 , a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows . As a result , U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to `` submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance . '' Those methods could include random drug testing , a remote alcohol testing system `` and\/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing , '' the order said . Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , `` or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer , '' the order said . He was to be electronically monitored during that time . Vick must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling `` if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer '' at his own expense , the order said .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Senate passed groundbreaking legislation Thursday that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity . President Obama has said the country must make significant changes to ensure equal rights . The expanded federal hate crimes law now goes to President Obama 's desk . Obama has pledged to sign the measure , which was added to a $ 680 billion defense authorization bill . President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure . The bill is named for Matthew Shepard , a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998 , and James Byrd Jr. , an African-American man dragged to death in Texas the same year . `` Knowing that the president will sign it , unlike his predecessor , has made all the hard work this year to pass it worthwhile , '' said Judy Shepard , board president of the Matthew Shepard Foundation named for her son . `` Hate crimes continue to affect far too many Americans who are simply trying to live their lives honestly , and they need to know that their government will protect them from violence , and provide appropriate justice for victims and their families . '' Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate-crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality . Attorney General Eric Holder has asserted that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs . Holder called Thursday 's 68-29 Senate vote to approve the defense spending bill that included the hate crimes measure `` a milestone in helping protect Americans from the most heinous bias-motivated violence . '' Watch survivor of attack discuss legislation '' `` The passage of this legislation will give the Justice Department and our state and local law enforcement partners the tools we need to deter and prosecute these acts of violence , '' he said in a statement . Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , called the measure `` our nation 's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people . '' `` Too many in our community have been devastated by hate violence , '' Solmonese said in a statement . `` We now can begin the important steps to erasing hate in our country . '' This month , Obama told the Human Rights Campaign , the country 's largest gay rights group , that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians . `` Despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open , '' he said during his address at the dinner for the Human Rights Campaign . `` This fight continues now , and I 'm here with the simple message : I 'm here with you in that fight . '' Among other things , Obama has called for the repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military , the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . He also has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act . The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage , for federal purposes , as a legal union between a man and a woman . It allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages . The Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers . More than 77,000 hate-crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007 , or `` nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade , '' Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June . The FBI , Holder added , reported 7,624 hate-crime incidents in 2007 , the most current year with complete data .","question":""}

Five people each have died in New Mexico and Colorado from consuming the tainted fruit , along with two people each in Kansas , Texas and now Louisiana . One has died in Indiana , Maryland , Missouri , Nebraska , New York , Oklahoma and Wyoming , the CDC said . In addition , one woman who was pregnant at the time of the illness had a miscarriage . Cases have also been reported in Alabama , Arkansas , California , Idaho , Illinois , Montana , North Dakota , Oregon , South Dakota , Texas , Virginia , West Virginia and Wisconsin . Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults , people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women , officials have said . The grower , Jensen Farms of Granada , Colorado , issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14 . The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves , the CDC said . Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately , even if some of them have been eaten , the CDC said . If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe , they are urged to ask their supermarket . If the source remains unknown , the fruit should be thrown out , officials have said . Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria , which can grow at low temperatures , authorities have said , and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Music producer Phil Spector was sentenced Friday to the maximum sentence of 19 years to life for the murder six years ago of actress Lana Clarkson . Phil Spector 's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they could n't reach a verdict . That means Spector , 69 , would be 88 before he would be eligible for parole . Slumped , stone-faced and wearing a dark suit and bright red tie , he sat silently throughout his sentencing by Judge Larry Paul Fidler . Spector 's lawyer gave a $ 17,000 check to Donna Clarkson , the victim 's mother , to pay for her funeral expenses -- part of the court-ordered sentence . `` All of our plans together are destroyed , '' the mother said , reading a statement on behalf of her family . `` Now , I can only visit her at the cemetery . '' Fidler denied a motion for a new trial by defense attorney Doron Weinberg , who said he would file an appeal . `` The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason -LSB- that -RSB- he did not kill Lana Clarkson , '' Weinberg said . Watch Spector receive his sentence '' `` Obviously , he 's not very happy , '' Spector 's wife , Rachelle , told reporters about her husband . `` I 'm going to stand by him and get him out of that awful place so he can come home where he belongs . '' Clarkson , 40 , was found dead -- slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector 's Alhambra , California , mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth -- in February 2003 . View a timeline of the case '' Spector 's trial , which began in October , ended last month when jurors deliberated for 30 hours and then announced a guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge . Fidler had ruled jurors also could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter . Spector 's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they could n't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations . Jurors then were deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction . Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing , citing Spector 's years-long `` pattern of violence '' involving firearms . `` This was not an isolated incident , '' Fidler said , noting Spector 's two firearms-related convictions from the 1970s . `` The taking of an innocent human life , it does n't get any more serious than that . '' In closing arguments at the retrial , prosecutor Truc Do called Spector `` a very dangerous man '' who `` has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women . Lana just happened to be the sixth . '' Weinberg argued that the prosecution 's case hinged on circumstantial evidence . He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out . Do pointed out to jurors , however , that Clarkson had bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something he said a suicidal woman would not have done . A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict . `` This entire jury took this so seriously , '' she said with tears in her eyes , before adding that `` it 's tough to be in a jury , '' because another person 's life is in the jury 's hands . Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie `` Barbarian Queen '' and appeared in many other films , including `` Deathstalker , '' `` Blind Date , '' `` Scarface , '' `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High '' and the spoof `` Amazon Women on the Moon . '' She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood 's House of Blues at the time of her death . In the 2007 trial , Spector 's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38 - caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector 's home . But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace . Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms . His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home , pistol in hand , saying , `` I think I killed somebody . '' Spector 's professional trademark was the `` Wall of Sound , '' the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner , Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s . The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called `` little symphonies for the kids '' -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes ' `` Be My Baby '' and the Righteous Brothers ' `` You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' . '' Spector co-produced the Beatles ' final album , `` Let It Be , '' and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up . His recording of Harrison 's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year . That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector , who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 . He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson 's death .","question":""}

Tom Daschle will be announced Thursday as President-elect Barack Obama 's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , a Democratic source said Wednesday . Former Sen. Tom Daschle , shown with his wife , Linda , says he will write Obama 's health care plan . CNN has previously reported that the 61-year-old former Senate majority leader from South Dakota would be Obama 's choice , but not the announcement date . In November , Daschle said he was excited about the possibility of serving as point person in Obama 's effort to change the nation 's health care system . Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama 's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year . `` I hope to have the plan enacted by next year , and then it will take several years to implement , '' Daschle said last month . Daschle said reforming health care in the United States must be a priority in the current economic climate . `` We ca n't afford not to do it , '' he said . `` If we do nothing , we 'll be paying twice as much on health care in 10 years as we do today . '' Daschle served as Democratic leader in the Senate from 1995 until he lost a re-election bid in 2004 . Representing South Dakota , he was first elected as a congressman in 1978 and served in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 1986 . He recently wrote a book on health care titled `` Critical : What We Can Do About the Health Care Crisis . '' In the book , he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare . Most Republicans oppose any such plan , saying it would give too much power to the government . They 've also questioned Daschle 's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm . His wife , Linda Daschle , is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients . But a source close to Daschle told CNN that Linda Daschle would be leaving the firm at the end of the year to set up her own company focusing on transportation lobbying in order to clear any potential conflicts of interest .

{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani authorities have arrested two top leaders of the Islamic militant group India blames for the November massacre in Mumbai , Pakistan 's prime minister confirmed Wednesday . Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures . The top military officer in the U.S. on Wednesday said he is `` encouraged '' by Pakistan 's recent arrests of `` significant players '' in the Mumbai attacks . U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the arrests amount to `` first steps '' toward determining who plotted the three day siege last month that killed 160 people in Mumbai , India 's financial capital . `` There are more steps to follow , '' he noted . He also thanked India for showing restraint against Pakistan , which it has accused of harboring the terrorist groups behind the November massacre . Zarar Shah , a top operational commander of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , and Zakir Rehman Lakhvi , whose arrest had been reported Tuesday , were among the militant figures rounded up in recent days , Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters . Gilani would not confirm the detention of Masood Azhar , the leader of another militant group , Jaish-e-Muhammad . But he said his government has launched its own investigation into India 's allegations that the gunmen who killed more than 160 people in Mumbai had links to Pakistan . The acknowledgment came three days after Pakistani security forces raided an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir , in the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the three-day siege of India 's financial capital . Both LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad were formed to battle Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir , and both were banned after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war . The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network . According to the U.S. government , Lakhvi , 47 , has directed LeT 's military operations in southeast Asia , Chechnya , Bosnia and Iraq . Pakistan 's Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar Ahmed told CNN 's sister network in India , CNN-IBN , that Lakhvi and Azhar had been arrested on Monday . Azhar has been in Pakistan since 1999 , when he was released from an Indian prison in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian airliner . Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks told investigators that he was trained at an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad , along with the nine other attackers who were killed in the three-day siege . A Pakistani security official said the terror raids on banned militant groups are ongoing and have resulted in at least 15 arrests .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Doctors often recommend exercise for patients with fibromyalgia , but the chronic pain and fatigue associated with the condition can make activities like running and swimming difficult . Tai chi -- a slow , meditative martial art -- may be an effective alternative , a new study suggests . Fibromyalgia patients who took tai chi classes twice a week for three months experienced less pain , stiffness , and fatigue than a control group that attended lifestyle education and stretching sessions , according to the study , which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine . Tai chi involves a series of slow , fluid movements that focus on balance and deep breathing . Although it 's not clear from the study how exactly tai chi might improve fibromyalgia symptoms , both the physical activity and the meditative aspects are likely beneficial , says Chenchen Wang , M.D. , the lead researcher and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine , in Boston , Massachusetts . `` Some people need the physical improvement ; some people need more mental improvement , '' she says . `` Tai chi can help with both . '' Health.com : How fibromyalgia is diagnosed Previous research has shown that tai chi can help relieve the symptoms of arthritis and other pain conditions , but this study is the first controlled trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for fibromyalgia , which affects an estimated 10 million Americans . The study included 66 fibromyalgia patients who were randomly assigned to take one-hour tai chi classes with an experienced teacher or one-hour classes that taught coping skills , pain-management techniques , and stretching . Participants were also asked to practice tai chi or stretch on their own for 20 minutes each day , depending on which group they were in . Health.com : 13 mistakes fibro patients make After three months , Wang and her colleagues asked the patients to rate their pain symptoms , physical functioning , fatigue , and mood , all of which were combined on a single scale ranging from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms . -LRB- The patients completed the same survey before the study began . -RRB- The average score among the tai chi patients dropped from 63 to 35 , while the average for the control group dropped by just nine points , from 68 to 59 . Three months after the sessions stopped , the scores had remained roughly the same , which suggests that the benefits of the tai chi were lasting , Wang says . The results were encouraging , as existing fibromyalgia treatments -- including medication , sleep therapy , and aerobic exercise -- fail to help many patients . `` We need another approach , '' says Wang . Health.com : Medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain Robert Shmerling , M.D. , an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , in Boston , says that he often recommends alternative treatments , such as acupuncture and massage , to his fibromyalgia patients , although some of them are skeptical . `` I would certainly put tai chi on the list , '' says Shmerling , who co-wrote an editorial that accompanies the study . `` It 's difficult to take something that 's as safe as tai chi and show that it has this dramatic benefit and not be enthusiastic about it . '' The calming style of tai chi used in the study , known as Yang , may be especially effective for fibromyalgia patients , says Kim D. Jones , Ph.D. , an associate professor at the Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing , in Portland . `` It works more on the parasympathetic nervous system , ... the part of the nervous system that helps us feel calm and relaxed , '' says Jones , who studies Yang-style tai chi and yoga in fibromyalgia but was n't involved in the study . Health.com : 13 conditions that mimic fibromyalgia Jones recommends that fibromyalgia patients find a well-trained instructor rather than trying tai chi on their own . She points out that learning tai chi in a group may have its own therapeutic benefits , by boosting confidence , for instance . Many community centers offer affordable tai chi classes , but experienced teachers can be expensive and hard to come by . However , if future studies support the benefits of tai chi , insurance companies might start to cover the practice , Shmerling says .","question":""}
{"answer":"Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran 's Bushehr nuclear power plant is just weeks from operating at full capacity , the country 's top nuclear official said Saturday . Feireidoun Abbasi , the head of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , also said Tehran has shown its new Iranian-made centrifuges to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- . The Bushehr plant , located along the Persian Gulf coast , will reach its full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by February 1 , Abbasi said , according to the country 's official news agency , IRNA . The plant was connected to the country 's electric grid in September with a capacity of 60 megawatts . At 1,000 megawatts , Bushehr will be able to provide 2.5 % of Iran 's current electricity consumption , the IAEA said . Abbasi made the announcement about Bushehr while attending a meeting on Iran 's nuclear achievements held in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas . He told the meeting that Tehran had shown the new generation of its homemade centrifuge machines to the IAEA `` in a bid to demonstrate the ability of Iranian scientists , '' he said . Abbasi said the centrifuges , which are used to enrich uranium , were shown to the deputy of IAEA , Director-General Yukiya Amano , but he did not say when . It was not immediately clear whether an IAEA representative had in fact been to Iran and seen the centrifuges . The new centrifuges will enable Iran to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5 % , according to experts cited by the news agency . Uranium enriched to between 3 % and 5 % is necessary to make fuel for reactors . Uranium enriched to 93.5 % is considered weapons-grade . The construction of Bushehr -- a civilian , not military , plant -- started in 1975 when Germany signed a contract with Iran . Germany , however , pulled out of the project following the 1979 revolution that created the current Islamic republic . Iran then signed a deal with Russia in 1995 , under which the plant was originally scheduled to be completed in 1999 , but the project was delayed repeatedly . Bushehr finally opened in August 2010 . The United States and other Western nations have expressed concerns that Iran 's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology mean it is developing a nuclear program for military purposes . The IAEA said in a November report that it has `` serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions '' to Iran 's nuclear program . The agency said it has information indicating Iran has carried out `` activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device . '' Iran has denied such allegations , saying the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under IAEA supervision . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the concern is not the Bushehr plant , but other nuclear facilities like Natanz , in the middle of the country ; a facility at Qom , south of Tehran ; `` and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United Nations court convicted a former governor of Rwanda to life in prison for his role in a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country . An estimated 800,000 people -- mainly Tutsis -- were killed in Rwanda in 1994 . Tharcisse Renzaho was found guilty of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . The verdict , delivered Tuesday , is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda -LRB- ICTR -RRB- . The U.N. court is holding hearings in Arusha , Tanzania , where it is based . Renzaho was governor of the capital , Kigali , and a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994 during the country 's genocide , when extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda . It began in April of that year and within 100 days , an estimated 800,000 people were killed . The court found that Renzaho ordered soldiers , police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify Tutsi civilians to be executed . It found he ordered the distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis . Renzaho also supervised a selection process at a refugee site where about 40 Tutsis were abducted and killed , the court found . Renzaho participated in an attack at the Sainte Famille church in which more than 100 Tutsis were killed . People across Rwanda sought refuge in churches all over the country as the genocide unfolded . He also made remarks encouraging the sexual abuse of women , according to the court , and was found criminally liable for the rapes that followed . The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre . Renzaho was arrested in September 2002 in the Democratic Republic of Congo . His trial began in January 2007 and closed in September that year after hearing from 53 witnesses , including Renzaho . Throughout the trial , Renzaho maintained his innocence and said he had no association with the militia . Renzaho 's lawyer blamed the case on political interference by the Rwandan government . Renzaho has the right to appeal the verdict . The decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal . Emmanuel Rukundo , a former military chaplain , was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison . The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen , and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians . Callixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide . The court found that Kalimanzira , a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry , participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them . Prosecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis , including pregnant women and their babies .","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration raised the stakes in the health care debate Monday , releasing a new blueprint that seeks to bridge the gap between measures passed by the Senate and House of Representatives last year . If enacted , the president 's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago . The White House said it would extend coverage to 31 million Americans . Among other things , the White House said it would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies . It increases the threshold -- relative to the Senate bill -- under which a tax on high-end health insurance plans would kick in . As with both the House and Senate plans , it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program . President Obama 's plan does not include a government-run public health insurance option , an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed by both Republicans and key Democratic moderates . It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill worked in by Sen. Ben Nelson , D-Nebraska , that would exempt his Midwestern state from paying increased Medicaid expenses . Administration officials said Obama 's measure would cut the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next 10 years . They estimate the total cost of the bill to be $ 950 billion in the next decade . The Senate bill would cost an estimated $ 871 billion , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , while the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost more than $ 1 trillion . The release of Obama 's plan sets the stage for a critical televised health care summit Thursday with top congressional Republicans . The White House is trying to pressure GOP leaders to present a detailed alternative proposal in advance of the meeting . `` We view this as the opening bid for the health meeting '' on Thursday , White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told reporters . `` We took our best shot at bridging the differences '' between the House and Senate bills . `` It is our hope the Republicans will come together around -LSB- their -RSB- plan and post it online '' before the meeting . President 's health care blueprint Pfeiffer said Obama will come to Thursday 's meeting `` with an open mind . '' The president 's willing to back decent Republican ideas if the two sides can have an `` honest , open , substantive discussion '' in which `` both parties can get off their talking points , '' he said . GOP leaders have indicated they will attend the meeting but have urged Democrats to scrap the Senate and House bills completely . They characterized Obama 's proposal Monday as setting the stage for a meeting that will amount to little more than political posturing . `` The president has crippled the credibility of this week 's summit by proposing the same massive government takeover of health care based on a partisan bill the American people have already rejected , '' said House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio . `` This new Democrats-only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums , destroy jobs , raise taxes and slash Medicare benefits . This week 's summit clearly has all the makings of a Democratic infomercial . '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , released a statement calling the plan `` disappointing that Democrats in Washington either are n't listening or are completely ignoring what Americans across the country have been saying . '' White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the GOP criticisms , arguing that Republican leaders had asked for this week 's meeting for months . `` If they 're not the party of no , Thursday 's the perfect venue to be the party of yes , '' Gibbs said . Highlights of Obama 's proposal Under Obama 's plan : \u2022 The health and human services secretary would work with a seven-member board of doctors , economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium hikes . This Health Insurance Rate Authority would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved , although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators . \u2022 New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families of four making up to $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level . Compared with the Senate bill , Obama 's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $ 44,000 and $ 66,000 , according to the White House . Compared with the House legislation , it lowers premiums for families making between $ 55,000 and $ 88,000 . \u2022 The Medicare prescription drug `` doughnut hole '' would be closed by 2020 . Under current law , Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $ 2,830 on prescription drugs . It starts paying again after an individual 's out-of-pocket expenses exceed $ 4,550 . \u2022 A 40 percent tax would be imposed on insurance companies providing so-called `` Cadillac '' health plans valued at more than $ 27,000 for families . The tax would kick in starting in 2018 for all plans . In contrast , the Senate bill would apply the tax to plans valued at more than $ 23,000 for families . The House bill does not include the tax , which labor unions vehemently oppose . \u2022 The federal government would assist states by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid coverage through 2017 . The federal government would cover 95 percent of costs for 2018 and 2019 , and 90 percent in the following years . \u2022 Health insurance exchanges would be created to make it easier for small businesses , the self-employed and unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage . \u2022 Total out-of-pocket expenses would be limited , and insurance companies would be prevented from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . Insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history . \u2022 Individuals under Obama 's plan would be required to purchase coverage or face a fine of up to $ 695 or 2.5 percent of income starting in 2016 , whichever is greater . The House bill , in contrast , would have imposed a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income . The Senate plan would have required a person to buy coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income . All three plans include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans . \u2022 Companies with more than 50 employees under Obama 's plan would be required to pay a fee of $ 2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company 's workers receives federal health care subsidies . The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation . As with the individual requirement , this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans . \u2022 Some $ 40 billion in tax credits would be established for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees . \u2022 States could choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the health insurance exchanges . Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds . The White House is following the Senate 's lead . The stricter House version banned abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies . \u2022 Illegal immigrants would not be allowed to buy health insurance in the health insurance exchanges . They would be exempted from the individual insurance mandate . As with abortion , the White House is adopting the Senate 's language . CNN 's Dana Bash , Lisa Desjardins , Kristi Keck , Suzanne Malveaux , Alan Silverleib and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The medical examiner has ruled that the death of Daniel Kerrigan , the father of figure skater Nancy Kerrigan , was a homicide , the Middlesex County district attorney 's office said Tuesday . The skater 's brother , Mark , was arraigned in January on assault and battery charges in an incident involving his father , but the district attorney 's office would not say if other charges might be filed against the younger Kerrigan in light of the medical examiner 's finding . Daniel Kerrigan , 70 , died January 24 after an alleged altercation with his son at the Kerrigan home in Stoneham , Massachusetts . The Kerrigan family released a statement through their attorney expressing disappointment `` that the medical examiner would release a cause of death without having all of the relevant facts . We believe this finding to be premature and inaccurate . '' `` The Kerrigan family does not blame anyone for the unfortunate death of Dan Kerrigan , who had a pre-existing heart condition , '' said the family statement , released by attorney Tracy Miner . Mark Kerrigan , 45 , pleaded not guilty to the charges against him January 26 . Through his attorney , he denied any responsibility in his father 's death . According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley , police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. January 24 from Brenda Kerrigan , wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan . Keeley told District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son , resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor . Keeley said Mark Kerrigan told authorities `` that he did in fact have an argument with his father , the argument became physical , he grabbed his father around the neck , and at some point the father collapsed to the floor . '' According to Keeley , police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house , `` clearly intoxicated '' and `` extremely combative . '' He refused to comply with police officers , said Keeley , and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home . Mark Kerrigan 's attorney , Denise Moore , said in court that Kerrigan was unemployed , was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents . He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress , apparently from his time in the Army , she added . Despite appeals from his attorney , the judge ordered Kerrigan held on $ 10,000 cash bail . His next court appearance is expected to be February 24 . Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France . In 1994 she earned a silver medal in Lillehammer , Norway . But she is perhaps best remembered for being injured in an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding 's ex-husband and an accomplice .","question":""}

Want beautiful skin like model Megan Gale ? Do n't overdo it , experts say . Cleansing and exfoliating You do n't need to wash or scrub as often -- or as vigorously -- as you may think . `` Many women go overboard here , figuring it will make their skin look better if they do both more frequently , '' says dermatologist Leslie Baumann . `` But that only damages the skin 's natural barrier and creates dryness and irritation . '' Combination skin How often : Wash your face twice a day , and gently exfoliate once or twice a week ; this is enough to keep skin balanced and encourage cell turnover , according to experts .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tiger Woods apologized on Wednesday for `` transgressions '' that `` let his family down . '' `` I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart . I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves , '' he said in a statement on his official Web site . `` I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect . I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family . Those feelings should be shared by us alone . '' Woods made the comments in a statement posted on his Web site the same day that a gossip magazine published a story alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old New York cocktail waitress . The nightclub hostess , identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods ' mistress had called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and `` ridiculous . '' In an interview published Tuesday , Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that `` not a word of it is true . '' `` I work in clubs , and I am a businesswoman , '' Uchitel said . `` I do not have sex with celebrities , and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods . '' Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving . The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash . Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators . He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing `` the many false , unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me . '' Opinion : Woods is only human The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times , as well as three U.S. Open titles . Investigators have said they do n't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour . A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related . Uchitel said she has met Woods twice , once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan 's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend . `` That 's my job : to know these people , to have a relationship with them , to hang out with them , '' she told the Post . `` It does n't mean I am having sex with them or an affair with them . '' She said the allegations `` must feel horrible '' to Woods ' wife , Elin Nordegren . `` The worst part of it , it 's not true , '' Uchitel said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman who pleaded guilty to kidnapping Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart in 2002 -- and attempting to kidnap Smart 's cousin a month later -- will be sentenced for both offenses in state and federal court Friday . Wanda Eileen Barzee , 64 , pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in Smart 's kidnapping . As part of that plea agreement , she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband , Brian David Mitchell , federal prosecutors have said . Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart , then 14 , at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family 's Salt Lake City , Utah , home in June 2002 . Smart was found nine months later , walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Barzee and Mitchell , a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts ' home . Federal prosecutors have recommended Barzee be sentenced to 15 years in prison in exchange for cooperation against Mitchell . In state court in February , Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in the attempted kidnapping of Smart 's cousin . In exchange for her plea , prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart 's abduction , said Nancy Volmer , spokeswoman for Utah state courts . The month after Smart was kidnapped , prosecutors alleged , Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin , but were unsuccessful . The girl was 15 years old at the time , according to CNN affiliate KSL-TV . She is not named in court documents . `` Mr. Mitchell 's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened , which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee , '' the court documents say . After her arrest in 2003 , Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home to abduct the girl , and planned to hold her , along with Smart , in the couple 's camp in the mountains , according to court documents . Barzee faces between one and 15 years in state prison . But prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence if she cooperates with the case against Mitchell , said Mark Biljanic , spokesman for the Salt Lake County district attorney 's office . The federal sentencing will be held first Friday , at 10:30 a.m. , followed by the state court sentencing at 1 p.m. . When she entered pleaded guilty to Smart 's kidnapping in federal court , Barzee apologized to Smart , according to a transcript . `` I 'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it , '' she said . `` I 'm so sorry , Elizabeth , for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family . It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day . '' Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell 's . After years of being declared incompetent , she recently was declared competent to stand trial , according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper . A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated , and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple , the Tribune said . At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October , Smart , now 21 , testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California . Just after her abduction , Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her , she said . During the nine months of her captivity , Smart testified , no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell . In March , U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ruled Mitchell competent to stand trial . His federal trial is set to begin November 1 . State court proceedings against him are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Republican National Convention is kicking off in full force Tuesday in the Twin Cities -- the first time the GOP has held a presidential convention there since 1892 . Laura Bush and Cindy McCain speak at a shortened first day of the Republican National Convention Monday . The convention , delayed briefly when Hurricane Gustav hit the Gulf Coast , is also being held later in the year than any nominating convention in history . Check out these tidbits of convention history and political trivia . Location The Republican National Convention is being held in the Xcel Energy Center , the home of the National Hockey League team the Minnesota Wild . To prepare the Xcel center for the GOP convention , workers removed 3,000 seats and installed more than 25 miles of cable Sen. Barack Obama gave his first speech as the Democrats ' presumptive 2008 presidential nominee at the Xcel Center on June 3 . The Twin Cities and Denver have each received $ 50 million each in federal funds for convention security . No Republican since Richard Nixon has carried Minnesota in a presidential general election -- the longest Democratic streak of any state in the nation . The Delegates About 2,300 delegates and 2,200 alternates delegates are expected to journey to the twin cities for the event , and the Minneapolis\/St . Paul economy is expected to benefit to the tune of $ 150 to $ 160 million . The Candidates , past and present John McCain turned 72 last week ; if elected , he 'll be the oldest president sworn in to a first term . Two GOP presidential nominees were older than McCain ; Ronald Reagan was 73 in 1984 when he was running for his second term and Bob Dole was 73 in 1996 . Dole lost that election to Bill Clinton . John McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam from 1967 to 1973 ; his service awards include the Silver Star , the Bronze Star , the Legion of Merit and a Purple Heart .

{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani authorities have arrested two top leaders of the Islamic militant group India blames for the November massacre in Mumbai , Pakistan 's prime minister confirmed Wednesday . Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures . The top military officer in the U.S . on Wednesday said he is `` encouraged '' by Pakistan 's recent arrests of `` significant players '' in the Mumbai attacks . U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the arrests amount to `` first steps '' toward determining who plotted the three day siege last month that killed 160 people in Mumbai , India 's financial capital . `` There are more steps to follow , '' he noted . He also thanked India for showing restraint against Pakistan , which it has accused of harboring the terrorist groups behind the November massacre . Zarar Shah , a top operational commander of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba , and Zakir Rehman Lakhvi , whose arrest had been reported Tuesday , were among the militant figures rounded up in recent days , Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters . Gilani would not confirm the detention of Masood Azhar , the leader of another militant group , Jaish-e-Muhammad . But he said his government has launched its own investigation into India 's allegations that the gunmen who killed more than 160 people in Mumbai had links to Pakistan . The acknowledgment came three days after Pakistani security forces raided an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir , in the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the three-day siege of India 's financial capital . Both LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad were formed to battle Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir , and both were banned after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war . The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network . According to the U.S. government , Lakhvi , 47 , has directed LeT 's military operations in southeast Asia , Chechnya , Bosnia and Iraq . Pakistan 's Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar Ahmed told CNN 's sister network in India , CNN-IBN , that Lakhvi and Azhar had been arrested on Monday . Azhar has been in Pakistan since 1999 , when he was released from an Indian prison in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian airliner . Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks told investigators that he was trained at an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad , along with the nine other attackers who were killed in the three-day siege . A Pakistani security official said the terror raids on banned militant groups are ongoing and have resulted in at least 15 arrests .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Champions League newcomers Manchester City are still waiting for their first win in the competition as a double from Mario Gomez gave in-form Bayern Munich a 2-0 Group A victory at the Allianz Arena . Bayern went into the match on the back of nine successive victories and they always looked dangerous in the first half , with Bastian Schweinsteiger volleying over the crossbar from close range in the 36th minute . However , the home side took the lead just two minutes later when goalkeeper Joe Hart did superbly to keep out shots from Frank Ribery and Thomas Mueller , but Gomez was on hand to stab home from three meters out . And the same player added a second goal on the stroke of half-time when Daniel Van Buyten 's header was wonderfully saved by Hart , only for Gomez to be on hand again from close range . City could find no response after the break , and a bad night for them was made worse when manager Roberto Mancini later confirmed that former captain Carlos Tevez refused to come onto the pitch in the second half after being named only as a substitute . An angry Mancini told reporters : `` I asked him to go on and help the team . We have 11 players -- maybe he was disappointed because he did n't play from the start . If I have my way he will be out of the club . '' The result leaves Bayern top of the table with a maximum six points from their two games , with Napoli second on four points after the Italian side beat Villarreal 2-0 in Naples . They opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Marek Hamsik chested down Ezequiel Lavezzi 's cross at the back post , before firing home with his left foot . And Edinson Cavani added a second from the penalty spot just three minutes later after Lavezzi was fouled by Gonzalo Rodriguez in the area . Big-spending City , who are joint top of the English Premier League with five wins and a draw from their six games so far , are back in third with just a single point following their opening home draw against Napoli , while Spanish side Villarreal are bottom of the group without a point , or a goal , so far . Meanwhile , 2010 champions Inter Milan made it two wins out of two under new coach Claudio Ranieri with a thrilling 3-2 Group B victory at CSKA Moscow . Ranieri replaced Gian Piero Gasperini last week , and began his San Siro tenure with a 3-1 Serie A win at Bologna over the weekend . And Inter showed they had got their shock opening 1-0 defeat by Trabzonspor out of their system , by repelling a CSKA fightback to secure their first victory in the tournament . Brazilian defender Lucio fired Inter ahead from the edge of the box after just six minutes and the Italian side doubled their lead midway through the half , when Giampaolo Pazzini netted from close range after fine work from Yuto Nagatomo . However , the Russian side pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed Alan Dzagoev free-kick and Brazilian Vagner Love levelled with 13 minutes remaining with a low drive . But , just a minute later , Mauro Zarate converted from Esteban Cambiasso 's pass to give Inter a vital victory . The other group match saw Trabzonspor and Lille share a 1-1 draw in Turkey . Moussa Sow opened the scoring for the French side when he converted Eden Hazard 's pass from a tight angle , but the home side earned a draw in the 75th minute when Gustavo Colman scored from the penalty spot after Mathieu Debuchy handled in the area . The result sees Trabzonspor top the group with four points , ahead of Inter on three , Lille on two and CSKA Moscow on a single point . Premier League leaders Manchester United needed a last-gasp Ashley Young goal to rescue a 3-3 Group C draw at home to Swiss side Basel , in a thrilling match that saw United squander a comfortable two-goal lead . United took a 16th minute lead when Danny Welbeck , in for the injured Wayne Rooney , was left unmarked in the area to score off the post , and the young England international added his second just a minute later when side-footing home a Ryan Giggs pass . But United took their foot off the gas and Basel pulled a goal back when Fabian Frei lashed home in the 58th minute after the United defense were slow to clear a corner . And , just two minutes later , Basel drew level when Frei 's right-wing cross was superbly headed home by his namesake Alex Frei . Basel looked to have stolen a famous victory when they went ahead in the 75th minute after Antonio Valencia fouled Marco Streller in the area and Alex Frei scored the resulting penalty . But Young 's late header from Nani 's cross rescued a point for United , although they surrendered their 20-match winning run at Old Trafford in all competitions . Benfica beat Otelul Galati 1-0 in Romania in the other group game , which leaves Basel and Benfica level on top of the group on four points , with Manchester United third on two points after drawing their opening two matches . Real Madrid are top of Group D with a maximum six points from their two matches , after a 3-0 win over Ajax at the Bernabeu . Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he converted a fine flowing move that saw five players involved . And the Spanish giants doubled their lead four minutes before the break when Kaka fired home a left-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net from Ronaldo 's pass . The home side secured the points early in the second half when Kaka found Karim Benzema , who found the net from 10 yards out . Lyon are second in the table with four points after they beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 at the Stade de Gerland in their 100th Champions League game . Bafetimbi Gomis opened the scoring with a sublime chip and Bakary Kone sealed the points from close range . Ajax are third in the group with a single point , while Zagreb are bottom after losing their opening two matches .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A first-half hat-trick by Lionel Messi helped Barcelona to a 5-0 win over Mallorca at the Nou Camp on Saturday . The Argentina international opened the scoring after 13 minutes with a spot kick after Emilio Nsue had handled the ball in the penalty area . Eight minutes later he tapped in after a miscue from Adriano before completing his hat-trick on the half-hour mark , expertly guiding home a cross from Dani Alves . Twenty-year-old Issac Cuenca scored his first senior goal for the club five minutes into the second half , while Alves rounded things off with a superbly taken goal in injury time . A ninth-minute goal from Argentina striker Higuain earned Real Madrid a 1-0 win at Real Sociedad on Saturday night . The win puts them one point ahead of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with 25 points , although Levante will depose them if they win at Osasuna on Sunday . Two goals from Frenchman Sofiane Feghouli and one for Aritz Aduriz earned fourth-placed Valencia a 3-1 win over Getafe , while Villareal were comfortable 2-0 winners over Rayo Vallecano -- Bruno Soriano and Borja Valero scoring goals in either half . Meanwhile in Italy , Juventus remain top of Serie A after a 2-1 win at Inter Milan on Saturday . All the goals came in an action-packed first half with Juve taking an early lead thanks to a 12th minute strike from Mirko Vucinic . Maicon equalized for the hosts in the 28th minute , but it was n't long before the visitors were back in front -- Claudio Marchisio scoring in the 33rd minute . The win gives Juve a two-point lead at the top of Serie A , but that will be reduced to one point if Udinese beat Palermo on Sunday . Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as AC Milan beat Roma 3-2 at the Stadio Olimpico to send the reigning league champions up to second in the table . The Swedish striker opened the scoring in the 17th minute before Nicolas Burdisso equalized for the home side in the 28th minute . Alessandro Nesta restored Milan 's lead two minutes later before Ibrahimovic made it 3-1 in the 78th minute to all but clinch three points . Bojan Krkic pulled one back for Roma three minutes before the end but it was n't enough to deny the Rossoneri vital away points . Napoli lost ground with the league leaders as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at Catania . Edinson Cavani had given Napoli the lead after just 27 seconds , but goals from Giovanni Marchese in the 25th minute and Gonzalo Bergessio three minutes after the break were enough to earn the home side all three points . Napoli played half the match with 10 men after Mario Santana was sent off shortly before half time .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Having a disease named after you is a decidedly mixed bag . On the one hand , your scientific developments are forever commemorated . On the other hand , though , you 're stuck with the knowledge that no patient will ever be happy upon hearing your name . Who are the scientists and doctors behind some of our most famous diseases and conditions , though ? Here are a few of the physicians and their eponymous ailments : 1 . Crohn 's disease The inflammatory digestive disease could just have easily ended up with the name Ginzburg 's disease or Oppenheimer 's disease . In 1932 , three New York physicians named Burrill Bernard Crohn , Leon Ginzburg , and Gordon Oppenheimer published a paper describing a new sort of intestinal inflammation . Since Crohn 's name was listed first alphabetically , the condition ended up bearing his name . 2 . Salmonellosis Yes , the salmonella menace that haunts undercooked chicken is named after a person . Daniel Elmer Salmon was a veterinary pathologist who ran a USDA microorganism research program during the late 19th century . Although Salmon did n't actually discover the type of bacterium that now bears his name -- famed epidemiologist Theobald Smith isolated the bacteria in 1885 -- he ran the research program in which the discovery occurred . Smith and his colleagues named the bacteria salmonella in honor of their boss . Mental Floss : Margherita pizza , other foods named after people 3 . Parkinson 's disease James Parkinson was a busy fellow . While the English apothecary had a booming medical business , he also dabbled in geology , paleontology , and politics ; Parkinson even published a three-volume scientific study of fossils . Following a late-18th-century foray into British politics where he advocated a number of social causes and found himself briefly ensnared in an alleged plot to assassinate King George III , Parkinson turned his attention to medicine . Parkinson did some research on gout and peritonitis , but it was his landmark 1817 study `` An Essay on the Shaking Palsy '' that affixed his name to Parkinson 's disease . 4 . Huntington 's disease George Huntington was n't the most prolific researcher , but he made his papers count . In 1872 , a fresh-out-of-med-school Huntington published one of two research papers he would write in his life . In the paper , Huntington described the effects of the neurodegenerative disorder that now bears his name after examining several generations of family that all suffered from the genetic condition . 5 . Alzheimer 's disease In 1901 , German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer began observing an odd patient at a Frankfurt asylum . The 51-year-old woman , Mrs. Auguste Deter , had no short-term memory and behaved strangely . When Mrs. Deter died in 1906 , Alzheimer began to dissect the patient 's brain , and he presented his findings that November in what was the first formal description of presenile dementia . Mental Floss : 4 people with super memory 6 . Tourette syndrome Credit George Gilles de la Tourette for his modesty . When the French neurologist first described the illness that now bears his name in 1884 , he did n't name it after himself . Instead , he referred to the condition as `` maladie des tics . '' Tourette 's mentor and contemporary Jean-Martin Charcot renamed the illness after Tourette . Tourette did n't have such great luck with patients , though . In 1893 , a deluded former patient shot the doctor in the head . The woman claimed that she lost her sanity after Tourette hypnotized her . Tourette survived the attack . 7 . Hodgkin 's lymphoma British pathologist Thomas Hodgkin first described the cancer that now bears his name while working at Guy 's Hospital in London in 1832 . Hodgkin published the study `` On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent Glands and Spleen '' that year , but the condition did n't bear his name until a fellow physician , Samuel Wilks , rediscovered Hodgkin 's work . 8 . Bright 's disease The kidney disease bears the name of Richard Bright , an English physician and colleague of Hodgkin 's at Guy 's Hospital . Bright began looking into the causes of kidney trouble during the 1920s , and in 1927 he described an array of kidney ailments that eventually became known as Bright 's disease . Today , doctors understand many of the symptoms historically clumped together as Bright 's disease are in fact different maladies , so the term is rarely used . 9 . Addison 's disease Guy 's Hospital was apparently the place to work in the 19th century if you wanted to have a disease named after you . Thomas Addison , a colleague of Bright and Hodgkin at Guy 's Hospital , first described the adrenal disorder we call Addison 's disease in 1855 . On top of this discovery , Addison also published an early study of appendicitis . Mental Floss : 11 celebrities who overcame dyslexia 10 . Tay-Sachs disease Although both of their names are attached to this genetic disorder , Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs did n't work together . In fact , they did n't even work in the same country . Tay , a British opthalmologist , first described the disease 's characteristic red spot on the retina in 1881 . In 1887 Bernard Sachs , a colleague of Burrill Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital , described the cellular effects of the disease and its prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews . 11 . Turner syndrome The chromosomal disorder got its name from Oklahoma doctor Henry Turner , who first described the condition in 1938 . 12 . Klinefelter 's syndrome The genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome bears the name of Harry Klinefelter , a young Boston endocrinologist who published a landmark study while working under the tutelage of endocrinology star Dr. Fuller Albright in 1942 . Albright pushed his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to be the lead author of the paper that described the condition , so the young Klinefelter 's name is forever associated with the syndrome . 13 . Asperger 's syndrome Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger first described the syndrome that now bears his name in 1944 after observing a group of over 400 children who suffered from what Asperger described as `` autistic psychopathy . '' Interestingly , since Asperger 's research was all written in German , his contributions to the literature went unrecognized until much later . The term `` Asperger 's syndrome '' did n't come into widespread usage until 1981 . For more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Utah man with chronic health problems died Wednesday from complications associated with swine flu , a local health official said . If confirmed , it would be the ninth U.S. fatality associated with the flu outbreak . Memorials appeared at the door of I.S. 238 in Queens , New York , this week after the death of an administrator . The man , who was from around Salt Lake City , was between 18 and 25 years old and `` had chronic medical conditions that may have contributed to severe complications from influenza , '' said Gary Edwards , executive director of the Salt Lake Valley Health Department . Also on Wednesday , health and education officials in New York announced that 21 of the city 's public schools had been closed after an increase of reports of students with flu-like symptoms . A school administrator in Queens died after being hospitalized with the H1N1 virus , commonly called swine flu . Nineteen of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private , the city 's Education Department announced in a news release . In addition , two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms , according the schools ' Web sites . In the city 's news release , city Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden repeated what has become a familiar refrain : `` We continue to see a rising tide of flu in many parts of New York City . As the virus spreads , we will look to slow transmission within individual school communities by closing individual schools . '' Late last week the city closed 11 schools in Queens and one in Brooklyn after confirming cases of the virus at Intermediate School 238 in Queens and unusually high levels of flu-like symptoms in the others . Mitchell Wiener , an assistant principal at I.S. 238 who died Sunday after being hospitalized with the disease , had an underlying condition , according to Frieden . The death in Utah was the first associated with the swine flu , or H1N1 , virus . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has linked eight U.S. deaths to the flu outbreak , but had not confirmed a link to H1N1 in the Utah death as of Wednesday evening . The outbreak has sickened at least 10,176 people and caused at least 80 deaths -- mostly in Mexico , according to the World Health Organization . The actual number of people affected may be higher , as it takes time for national governments to confirm cases and report them to the global body . In the United States , at least 5,710 cases of swine flu have been reported , according to recent figures from the CDC . Utah officials echoed national agencies in saying that the swine flu has largely behaved like typical seasonal influenza , which usually is fatal only among the very old , the very young or people with other health problems . In New York , 19 of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private , it and the city 's Education Department announced in a news release .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nineteen former patients at a Denver , Colorado , hospital have tested positive for hepatitis C , federal prosecutors said Thursday as they announced new charges against a former hospital employee accused of exposing the patients to the virus . A hospital worker is accused of injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients . Prosecutors charged Kristen Diane Parker with 21 counts of tampering with a consumer product and another 21 counts of obtaining a controlled substance by deceit or subterfuge , according to an indictment . Parker , 26 , had previously faced three federal counts from earlier this month . Parker , who worked as a surgical technician at Rose Medical Center in Denver , is accused of injecting herself with syringes that held patients ' pain medication Fentanyl , then replacing the pain medication in the syringes with saline , according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for Colorado . In a statement to police during the investigation , Parker said , `` I ca n't take back what I did , but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life , and so does everyone else . '' Parker 's attorney did not return a call from CNN on Thursday . Authorities said Parker knew she had hepatitis C , a contagious liver disease . Hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Parker believes she contracted the virus through using heroin and sharing needles with other users while she lived in New Jersey in 2008 , authorities said . According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration , Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C . She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients . Parker worked at Rose Medical Center from October 2008 to April 2009 , said Jeff Dorschner , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for Colorado . Parker 's employment was terminated after she failed a hospital-ordered drug test , said Leslie Teegarden , spokeswoman for Rose Medical Center . The tests were ordered after co-workers reported `` suspicious behavior , '' Teegarden said Thursday . Rose Medical Center contacted about 4,700 patients who may have been exposed to the virus , according to a statement on the center 's Web site . Of those patients , 3,540 have been tested thus far , Teegarden said . She said the hospital plans to use tamper-resistant , pre-filled Fentanyl syringes to prevent intentional contaminations . Parker also worked at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs , Colorado . Prosecutors have not charged her with any crimes related to her employment at the other two facilities . About 1,200 patients may have been exposed between May 4 and July 1 of this year , when Parker worked at Audubon , according to the center 's Web site . As of last week , 545 of Audobon 's former patients had been tested for the virus , according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment . One patient tested positive for hepatitis C , but that infection could not be linked to Parker , according to the department 's Web site . Nearly 1,000 patients had been tested as of Thursday , said Audubon spokeswoman Amy Triandiflou . Details about what Parker may have done to expose Audubon patients to the virus are still sketchy , Triandiflou said . More than 2,700 patients could have been exposed at Northern Westchester Hospital , according to the hospital 's Web site . The site did not indicate whether any infections had been detected . There is no vaccine for hepatitis C . If Parker is convicted and if any one of the former patients suffers serious bodily injury because of her actions , she could face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison , prosecutors said . If she is convicted and if any one of the former patients dies as a result of the infection , she could be sentenced to life in prison , according to prosecutors .

{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former engineer for Rockwell International and Boeing was convicted Thursday of economic espionage and acting as an agent of China , authorities said . A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10 , 2003 at Cape Canaveral , Florida . Dongfan `` Greg '' Chung , 73 , was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets , including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket . U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage ; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country ; one count of acting as an agent of the People 's Republic of China ; and one count of making false statements to the FBI , according to a statement from federal prosecutors . Carney presided over Chung 's three-week bench trial last month . In a bench trial , there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony . Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008 . He was taken into custody after Carney 's ruling was read . Chung , a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen , was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996 , and by Boeing thereafter . He retired from Boeing in 2002 , but returned as a contractor , a position he held until September 2006 , prosecutors said . Chung held a `` secret '' security clearance , authorities said . `` For years , Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China , '' said David Kris , assistant attorney general for national security , in the prosecutors ' statement . `` Today 's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America 's economic and national security to assist foreign governments . '' The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China . That engineer , Chi Mak , and several of his relatives were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC , authorities said . Mak was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison last year . According to evidence presented at trial , individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending tasks to Chung via letter as early as 1979 , federal prosecutors said . Over the years , the letters directed Chung to collect data related to the space shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft . In his letters back to China , Chung referenced materials he had already sent , including 24 manuals relating to the B-1 bomber , which Rockwell had forbidden for distribution outside the company and federal agencies . In addition , between 1985 and 2003 , Chung traveled to China several times and met with government officials . His contacts in China discussed these trips in letters and recommended methods of passing information , authorities said . In a 2006 search of Chung 's home , FBI and NASA agents found more than 250,000 pages of documents from Boeing , Rockwell and other defense contractors in the house and in its crawl space , prosecutors said . They included `` scores of binders containing decades ' worth of stress analysis reports , test results and design information for the space shuttle . '' Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine , authorities said . The charge of acting as an agent for a foreign government carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and making false statements to federal investigators each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . Chung is set for sentencing November 9 .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The chief operating officer of the National Children 's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet , authorities said . Robert A . Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother , according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York . In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department . Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer 's computer at the museum , according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement . The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are `` horrified '' by news of Singer 's arrest . They reported that he has been suspended from his post , effective immediately , and is barred from the property . Singer , 49 , was arrested at his home in Falls Church , Virginia , by federal agents , according to the prosecutors ' statement . Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging `` chats '' and e-mail communications with the undercover detective , posing as the woman and her daughter , from August to September . He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce . If convicted on each count , he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count , prosecutors said . Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective , posing as the mother , in an America On Line chat room called `` Cuties . '' The chat room attracts people who `` are known to trade in pornographic images , including child pornography , '' according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . `` On five separate occasions in August 2007 , Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter , including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation , '' prosecutors said . In his communications with the supposed daughter , Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy , authorities said . In August 2007 , he sent her two images featuring child pornography , according to the affidavit , with the instruction , `` just delete it when you are done . '' A search of Singer 's AOL account activity showed that from July to September , he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective , authorities said in the statement . Also , the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography . Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday . He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children 's Museum , but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama will announce the U.S. troop strategy for Afghanistan in a speech at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , New York , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday . In the speech , Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan , its interests there and his decision-making process , Gibbs said , but `` the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement . `` Our time there will be limited , and I think that 's important for people to understand , '' he said . `` We are in year nine '' in Afghanistan , Gibbs told reporters . `` We 're not going to be there another eight or nine years . '' Obama will meet with members of Congress at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before the speech . Cost issues are among the topics the president will address , Gibbs said . `` It 's a million dollars a troop for a year , '' he said . `` Ten thousand troops is $ 10 billion . That 's in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan . That also does not include training , and it does n't include the maintaining of a security force . It 's very , very , very expensive . '' But , Gibbs added , `` I think the president , throughout this process , has talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our treasury , and I think he 'll continue to talk about it . '' The president ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March . Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban , the Islamic militia originally ousted by U.S. military action in 2001 . Obama has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent , ranging from sending a few thousand troops to the 40,000 McChrystal requested . A defense official told CNN earlier this week the Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of Obama 's decision on the 8-year-old war . There had been no final word on Obama 's decision as of Tuesday , said the Defense Department official , who has direct knowledge of the process . But the official said planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan with the expectation that Obama was leaning toward approving that many . iReporters sound off ; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive the paperwork Thursday to approve orders to deploy 1,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , to Afghanistan in late December -- the first of the new troops to be sent , a U.S. military official told CNN on Wednesday . The official is not authorized to talk about the plans because they have not been officially announced . The 1,000 Marines are part of a battalion task force that has been preparing and training for the deployment , the official said . The president held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night , and he told reporters Tuesday that he would announce new plans for Afghanistan after Thanksgiving . McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday , along with Vice President Joe Biden , Gates , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry , the U.S. ambassador in Kabul , Afghanistan . Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations had been `` comprehensive and extremely useful . '' `` It 's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there -LSB- in Afghanistan -RSB- , you 've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts , '' he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . The defense official said Tuesday that the military is planning to send three U.S. Army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops . CNN reported last month that this was the Pentagon 's preferred option . However , the official said Wednesday that the Marines are expected to deploy 8,000 combat , aviation and support troops , plus 1,000 to 1,500 Marines as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500 . They will be in addition to the 11,000 Marines already in Afghanistan . After the first deployment , the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months , the military official said . The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place . Currently , brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those next in line to deploy . About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan , along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance . Two U.S. military officials have told CNN that NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wants . The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance 's headquarters in Brussels , Belgium . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brussels next week to meet with allies , State Department sources told CNN . Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers , but he said NATO would be asked for additional help . Obama 's Afghanistan plan will include `` very broad terms '' that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation , a senior U.S. military official told CNN . Those points will be used to determine how and when troops can be brought home . Another senior military official said McChrystal will take his orders from Obama and will do the best he can with what he has . The question , he said , is not the number of troops , but is whether the United States has `` the right resources to do what we need to do . '' `` We ca n't just go and blow people up and win this war , '' the official said . `` We have to gain the trust of the people , and that is a major part of the plan here . '' U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington . The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory -- but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught . Taliban fighters have since regrouped to the mountainous region along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other . Al Qaeda 's top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region . The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops .

A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday also indicates the vast majority of Americans believe that full-body scanners should be used in airports across the country . Nearly two-thirds of people questioned in the poll said they have a moderate or great deal of confidence in the administration to protect the public from future terrorist attacks , up 2 percentage points from August . Thirty-five percent said they have not much or no confidence , down 1 percentage point from August . Read the full poll results -LRB- PDF -RRB- A number of Republicans have criticized President Obama over his handling of the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan . But according to the survey , 57 percent approve of the way Obama has responded , while 39 percent disapprove of how he handled the situation . `` Only a third of Republicans have a positive view of Obama on this matter , but the key for the administration is the 55 percent of independents who approve of how the president responded to the incident on Christmas Day , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . The poll also indicates no increase in overall concern about terrorism . `` In October , about a third said they were worried that a family member would become a victim of terrorism , and that number is unchanged in the wake of the attempted attack in December , '' Holland said . `` The public seems to react calmly to individual incidents , possibly because most Americans believe that the government can not prevent every single terrorist plot from occurring . '' Six in 10 said terrorists always will find a way to launch an attack , no matter what the government does , he added -- identical to the number who felt that way during the Bush administration . The poll indicates a majority , 57 percent , think suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab should be tried in military court and not a civilian criminal court . Forty-two percent back handling the case in civilian court . According to the survey , Americans also are split on whether heads should roll as a result of the attempted bombing of the airliner . Forty-six percent questioned feel that top officials in the federal agencies responsible for handling the issue of terrorism should be fired , while 51 percent said no . The poll indicates that nearly eight in 10 believe full-body scanners should be used in U.S. airports , while 15 percent said they would refuse to go through one of the machines if asked to do so . `` Most Americans do n't see full-body scanners as a health risk , and more than seven in 10 say they would be unconcerned if asked to go through one at an airport , '' Holland said . `` Women in particular seem to prefer the idea of a full-body scanner to being frisked by a security guard , even when the question makes clear that the guard doing the manual pat-down would also be a woman .

She was later found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia , said Orlov , the head of the organization 's Moscow office . Estemirova , 50 , was a leading human rights activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly criticizing Chechnya 's authoritarian president , Ramzan Kadyrov , and his methods . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed indignation at the murder and said her killers should be punished to the full extent of the law , his office said .

She was devoted to shining a light on human rights abuses , particularly in Chechnya . '' The Committee to Protect Journalists , in a written statement , demanded that the killing be thoroughly investigated immediately . `` As she uncovered massive , ongoing human rights violations in Chechnya by the federal and regional authorities , Estemirova was often at odds with Chechen authorities , according to her colleagues , '' the advocacy group said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bone fragment found near the California home where Jaycee Dugard is said to have been confined for 18 years is `` probably human , '' a sheriff 's spokesman said Tuesday . Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor 's backyard . Investigators said they found the bone last week on a neighbor 's property in an area that Dugard 's accused captor and rapist , Philip Garrido , had access to . The fragment , which was analyzed by an outside expert , will go on to the state DNA lab for testing , Jimmy Lee , director of Public Affairs for the Contra Costa County 's Sheriff 's Office said in an e-mail . `` The expert has determined that the bone fragment found in the backyard of Garrido 's neighbor is probably human , '' Lee said . `` We will be requesting the state to see if it can develop a DNA profile on the fragment . It should be noted that it is not uncommon to find Native American remains in Contra Costa County , '' he said . Garrido and his wife , Nancy , have pleaded not guilty to 29 felony charges , including rape and kidnapping , stemming from Dugard 's disappearance when she was 11 years old . Investigators believe Garrido kidnapped Dugard in 1991 in South Lake Tahoe , California , fathered two daughters with her and held her captive in a well-hidden compound behind his home in Antioch . After the Garridos were arrested in August , investigators used cadaver dogs to search the couple 's ramshackle home and the surrounding rural property for possible connections to unsolved crimes . Police in Hayward , California , are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht , Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said last week . Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance , both were abducted in daylight and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido , Orrey said . In Dublin , California , investigators said last week they were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff , who was 13 when she was abducted . Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976 . He was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence . He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole . CNN 's Dan Simon contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been suspended indefinitely by the National Football League , days after he pleaded guilty to killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence of alcohol , the NFL said . Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth on Tuesday pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter . Stallworth , 28 , pleaded guilty in a Florida court Tuesday to DUI manslaughter charges in the March death of construction worker Mario Reyes . Under terms of a plea agreement , he will serve 30 days . Prosecutors said he began serving his sentence immediately . `` The conduct reflected in your guilty plea resulted in the tragic loss of life and was inexcusable , '' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told Stallworth in a letter Thursday , the league said . Excerpts from the letter were posted on the NFL Web site . `` While the criminal justice system has determined the legal consequences of this incident , it is my responsibility as NFL commissioner to determine appropriate league discipline for your actions , which have caused irreparable harm to the victim and his family , your club , your fellow players and the NFL . '' Stallworth 's suspension is effective immediately , the league said . Goodell wrote in the letter that `` in due course '' the league would contact his attorney to schedule a meeting with him , after which a final determination would be made on discipline . Stallworth was driving his black Bentley GT east on the MacArthur Causeway , which connects Miami , Florida , to the South Beach area of Miami Beach , when he struck Reyes on the morning of March 14 , according to prosecutors . He had been drinking at a Miami Beach club , according to court documents . His blood alcohol level was 0.126 percent , prosecutors said ; Florida 's legal limit is 0.08 . Reyes , 59 , reportedly was heading to a bus stop after work when he was struck . Court documents said he suffered `` critical head , chest and abdominal injuries '' and died at a hospital . When police arrived at the scene , Stallworth told them he was the driver of the car and admitted striking Reyes . During Tuesday 's hearing , Stallworth offered his `` deepest condolences to the Reyes family . '' `` Though I can not bring back Mr. Reyes or ease his family 's pain , I can and will honor his memory by committing my time , my resources and my voice by educating this community about the dangers of drunk driving , '' he said . Stallworth could have served up to 15 years in prison . But State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle noted in a statement that he cooperated with authorities and had no previous criminal record or traffic violations . Reyes ' family supported the plea agreement , she said . Stallworth 's attorney , Chris Lyons , on Tuesday told CNN sister network HLN that Stallworth had reached an `` amicable '' financial settlement with Reyes ' family but would not disclose the amount . He said the length of Stallworth 's jail term `` had nothing to do with Donte Stallworth being a celebrity , a professional football player or money . '' Stallworth has shown `` genuine remorse '' and accepted responsibility for his actions , Lyons said . Goodell wrote Stallworth that there is `` ample evidence to warrant significant discipline '' under both the NFL 's personal conduct and substance abuse policies . `` There is no reasonable dispute that your continued eligibility for participation at this time would undermine the integrity of and public confidence in the league , '' the letter said . `` Everyone associated with the league derives tremendous benefits from participating in our game and from the extraordinary support we receive from the public , '' Goodell wrote . `` With these benefits comes , among other things , the responsibility to conduct ourselves in a lawful and responsible way , with no entitlement to or expectation of favorable treatment . '' Goodell notified NFL clubs earlier this year that there would be increased emphasis on addressing driving under the influence and other misconduct , the league said . It noted the NFL offers a `` safe rides '' program used by most clubs to provide players and other employees with alternative transportation if they have been drinking . Under terms of Stallworth 's plea agreement , he will face two years of house arrest upon his release . He is also required to donate $ 2,500 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving , serve eight years of probation and submit to random drug and alcohol testing throughout his probation . His driver 's license was permanently revoked . CNN 's Rich Phillips contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Terrell Owens , a former San Francisco 49er and a former Philadelphia Eagle , is now a former Dallas Cowboy . The Cowboys released Owens late Wednesday , according to published reports . The Dallas Cowboys have decided to part ways with wide receiver Terrell Owens , according to published reports . Questions surrounding the future of the controversial wide receiver have swirled since the Cowboys ' season ended with a 44-6 loss at Philadelphia that kept Dallas out of the playoffs . Owner Jerry Jones had said in recent weeks that he had not decided whether to keep or release Owens . In early February , Jones struck down an ESPN report that Jones ' son , Stephen , who is the team 's vice president , was lobbying his father to cut the wide receiver . Owens signed a three-year , $ 25 million contract with Dallas in March 2006 . He signed a new four-year , $ 34 million deal that included a $ 12 million signing bonus , in June 2008 . Owens finished the 2008 season 69 receptions for 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns . In Owens ' three seasons with the team , the Cowboys went 31-17 , but 0-2 in the playoffs . While Owens has produced solid numbers on the field , his career has been plagued with controversy . After Owens left the San Francisco 49ers in 2003 , he insinuated in an interview with Playboy magazine that his then-quarterback , Jeff Garcia , was homosexual . As a Philadelphia Eagle , Owens made headlines for coming back to play in Super Bowl XXX after suffering a severely sprained ankle and a fractured fibula weeks earlier . The following season , he voiced his displeasure with QB Donovan McNabb and Eagles management , which led to a four-game suspension without pay and his eventual deactivitation from the team . In September 2006 , police responded to Owens ' home after his publicist found the wide receiver unresponsive with an empty bottle of painkillers . Owens refuted reports that it was a suicide attempt and claimed a combination of painkillers and supplements made him groggy . This past season , Owens was reportedly jealous of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo 's relationship with tight end Jason Witten . According to published reports , Owens believed Romo and Witten held private meetings and created plays without including him . Published reports also said Owens had issues with Cowboys offensive coordinator Jason Garrett 's play-calling . -- CNN.com 's Kamal Wallace contributed to this report .","question":""}

Taylor 's attorney said the former New York Giants star denied the charges and will fight them . `` My client did not have sex with anybody . Period , '' Arthur Aidala said , adding : `` Lawrence Taylor did not rape anybody . '' Taylor appeared at an afternoon court hearing where a judge set bail at $ 75,000 . Taylor was not asked to enter a plea and left the courthouse after posting bail . Seeing television cameras outside the courthouse , Taylor said , `` I 'm not that important '' as he walked away . Taylor , 51 , was arrested in a Holiday Inn room a few hours after the alleged rape took place , according to Christopher St. Lawrence , the town supervisor and police commissioner in Ramapo , about 30 miles northwest of New York City . Police Chief Peter Brower said Taylor was charged with third-degree rape , a felony , for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17 . Taylor also was charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage victim $ 300 to have sex , Brower said . According to Brower , the rape charge carries a possible four-year prison term , and the patronization charge , a misdemeanor , could bring up to a year in prison .

Aidala said after the bail hearing that Taylor `` is denying and preparing to fight each and every one of those charges . '' Aidala said that `` no violence , no force , no threat , no weapons '' was involved in the case . He noted that the rape charge against Taylor was for consensual sex with a minor and said Taylor denied it . St. Lawrence and Brower said the alleged victim , since March a runaway from New York 's Bronx borough , was allegedly brought to Ramapo by a pimp on Wednesday night . When the pimp and the girl returned to New York early Thursday , she texted an uncle who notified the New York police , St. Lawrence said .

After kicking drugs , he worked as a sports commentator and appeared as a contestant on ABC 's `` Dancing With the Stars '' in 2009 . Taylor and his dance partner on the program , Edyta Sliwinska , were eliminated in the seventh week of competition . Brower said that police found a bottle of alcohol in Taylor 's hotel room but that Taylor showed no sign of inebriation . Brower said that no drugs were found in the room .

{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Over the past several years , researchers have noticed an odd pattern in the relationship between body weight and Alzheimer 's disease : Middle-aged people have a higher long-term risk of developing the disease if they 're overweight or obese , while older people have a lower risk of the disease if they 're carrying excess weight . A new study , published this week in the journal Neurology , may offer a clue to this so-called obesity paradox . Non-overweight individuals in their late 60s , 70s , and early 80s who have no outward symptoms of Alzheimer 's are more likely than their heavier peers to have biological markers -LRB- or biomarkers -RRB- of the disease , the study found . This finding raises the possibility that weight loss or a low body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- later in life may be an early warning sign of mental decline , the researchers say . `` Weight changes or body composition changes may actually be a manifestation of disease , which would explain the obesity being an apparent protective factor , '' says Jeffrey M. Burns , M.D. , the lead author of the study and the associate director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer 's Disease Center , in Kansas City . Health.com : 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease Well before memory loss and other symptoms appear , Alzheimer 's may trigger metabolism changes that promote weight loss , Burns says . `` In general , we think of Alzheimer 's as a brain disease , but this is evidence that there are systemic problems throughout the body in the early stages of Alzheimer 's . '' Burns and his colleagues analyzed data from the Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative , a huge study spanning 58 hospitals and universities that 's funded by the National Institutes of Health and an array of nonprofit organizations and drug companies . The goal of the initiative is to find ways to measure the progression of Alzheimer 's and the precursor condition known as mild cognitive impairment . The researchers looked at 101 people who underwent brain scans designed to identify the plaques and abnormal tangle of proteins that are the hallmark of Alzheimer 's , and another 405 people whose cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for fragments of these proteins -LRB- beta-amyloid peptide and tau -RRB- . Each group included some people with Alzheimer 's disease , some with mild cognitive impairment , and some with no signs of mental deterioration . Health.com : 7 ways to protect your memory There was no connection between BMI and Alzheimer 's biomarkers in the patients who actually had Alzheimer 's . But in the other two groups , lower BMI was associated with higher levels of biomarkers and a higher likelihood of having brain plaques and tangles . Among people with mild cognitive impairment , for instance , 85 percent of non-overweight individuals had signs of these brain abnormalities , compared to just 48 percent of those who were overweight or obese . -LRB- A BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight . -RRB- Richard Lipton , M.D. , an attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center , in New York City , who was not involved in the new research , agrees with the authors that the findings suggest that Alzheimer 's can affect the entire body early on . `` The most obvious manifestations of Alzheimer 's disease are in the brain , but Alzheimer 's disease has a large number of effects on the body as well , '' says Lipton , the principal investigator of a long-running study on aging and Alzheimer 's . `` The brain regulates blood pressure and respiratory rate and pulse and hunger and satiety and blood flow to various organs in the body , so it would n't be surprising if a widespread disease of the brain had effects on many , many different aspects of bodily function . '' Health.com : Aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise The study shows only an association , not cause and effect , so Burns and his colleagues ca n't be sure that Alzheimer 's directly causes weight loss -LRB- or prevents weight gain -RRB- . In fact , the researchers found no association between BMI changes and Alzheimer 's biomarkers in a subset of study participants whose weight was tracked for two years . May Ahmad Baydoun , Ph.D. , a staff scientist at the National Institute on Aging who studies risk factors for dementia , described the study as `` very strong '' overall . But , she says , `` the results would have been a lot stronger if they found weight loss over time is associated with increased Alzheimer 's disease pathology , also over time . '' The relationship between weight loss and the progression of Alzheimer 's is likely a two-way street , Lipton says . People who start to experience declines in mental function may shop for groceries less regularly , cook less frequently , and eat less -- and the poor nutrition that results could in turn accelerate the progression of the disease , he says . Health.com : Foods that may help save your memory `` It seems pretty likely to me that both things are true -- that good health practices prevent illness , and health practices may fall apart in the early stages of illness and accelerate cognitive and physical decline , '' Lipton says .","question":""}

{"answer":"DUBAI , United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on Tuesday accused the international media of `` exaggerating '' the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and Somalia . Refugees from Darfur gather at a camp in Chad . Sudan 's president says the crisis in Darfur is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir spoke at a news conference in Dubai following a three-day visit to the Persian Gulf emirate . He said the crisis in Sudan 's western Darfur region is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir 's government has been blamed by the United Nations of supporting militias that conduct `` indiscriminate attacks '' on civilians in the Darfur region , including torture , rape , and killings . Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the U.N. of widespread human rights abuses . During Tuesday 's news conference , el-Bashir restated his position that foreign intervention in Darfur was an obstacle in achieving peace in the region . The Sudanese president has been outspoken in his opposition to allowing non-African forces in Darfur . At the start of this year , more than 9,000 members of a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering . The force will eventually number 26,000 . Speaking on Tuesday , el-Bashir said that the fighting only affects 10 percent of the region . In the majority of Darfur , there is little to no conflict and people are living normal lives , he said . Citing Sudanese government statistics , el-Bashir said that less than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and less than 500,000 have been displaced . International figures , including United Nations ' data , put the death toll in Darfur at approximately 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced by the violence since 2003 . The conflict started five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government . Sudan 's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing the tribal militias known as janjaweed , which have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur 's local communities .

He was 78 . The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007 . Pinter 's wife , Lady Antonia Fraser , confirmed his death . Pinter , who had been suffering from cancer , died on Christmas Eve , according to the reports . Fraser told the Guardian newspaper : `` He was a great , and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years . He will never be forgotten . '' Pinter was known for such plays as `` The Birthday Party '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , `` The Homecoming '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , `` No Man 's Land '' -LRB- 1974 -RRB- , `` Mountain Language '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , and `` Celebration '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary `` Pinter pause '' -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations . His movie credits , like his plays , span the decades and include `` The Quiller Memorandum '' -LRB- 1965 -RRB- and `` The French Lieutenant 's Woman '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play `` Betrayal , '' the story of a doomed love affair told backward , which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley , Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge . He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005 . Pinter 's later plays were more overtly political , with works such as `` One for the Road '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` The New World Order '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- focusing on state torture . In commentaries , he became a blistering critic of the United States , writing in his Nobel lecture that the country `` quite simply does n't give a damn about the United Nations , international law or critical dissent , which it regards as impotent and irrelevant . It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead , the pathetic and supine Great Britain . '' But Pinter could also be a man of great humor . In 2006 , he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier . `` Two days later , I woke up to find that I 'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature , '' he said . `` So life is really full of ups and downs , you see . '' Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10 , 1930 . He was the son of Jewish immigrants , his father a dressmaker , his mother `` a wonderful cook , '' he once recalled . In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts , then as now one of Great Britain 's most renowned drama schools . But the RADA did n't take ; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms . He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work , `` The Room , '' in 1957 . Later that year he wrote `` The Birthday Party , '' a `` comedy of menace , '' in the words of one critic , that helped make Pinter 's reputation -- though , in an irony he could appreciate , after it closed in London due to scathing notices . Ensuing Pinter plays , including `` The Dumb Waiter '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- and `` The Homecoming , '' made him Britain 's most famous playwright , as influential to `` late 20th-century British theater -LSB- as -RSB- Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages , '' CNN.com 's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006 . `` What 's generally meant as a ` Pinter play ' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted , even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat , '' Anderson wrote . Pinter 's plays featured sparse dialogue , often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement . In `` The Birthday Party , '' a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it 's his birthday ; in `` The Homecoming '' -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family , where the wife becomes the center of attention . Pinter credited Samuel Beckett , among others , as an influence . -LRB- He starred in a production of Beckett 's `` Krapp 's Last Tape '' in 2006 . -RRB- In turn , writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter 's elliptical lead . `` One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness , '' Pinter once said . He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant . Following a 1980 divorce , Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser .","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama 's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war , a defense official said Tuesday . Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday . A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president 's decision . But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving , the official said . Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March . Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban , the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001 . The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent , ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested . McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday 's conference with Obama and other top advisers , which broke up at 10 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry , the U.S. ambassador in Kabul , were among the other senior officials in the meeting . Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been `` comprehensive and extremely useful . '' `` It 's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there , you 've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts , '' he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . The military has planning under way to send these units : three U.S. Army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops , according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations . CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon . The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place . Currently , brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy . About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan , along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance . Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted . The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance 's headquarters in Brussels , Belgium . Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers , but he said NATO would be asked for additional help . `` Clearly , if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan , there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces , '' Morrell said . U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network 's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington . The invasion overthrew the Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught . Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other . Al Qaeda 's top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region . The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops . A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan . Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision , with 49 percent opposed . The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly , up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March . Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent , with 52 percent opposed . iReporters sound off ; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday . Singh said the international community needs `` to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan , to help it emerge as a modern state . '' `` The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated , '' he said . `` President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism . '' India is one Afghanistan 's biggest international donors , contributing $ 1.2 billion in aid . That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan , India 's nuclear rival in South Asia . But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support . In addition , several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders , giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier . `` I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week , '' Nicholas Burns , a former State Department official , said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly `` on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups . '' `` The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India , but we can quietly , behind the scenes , push them to reduce their problems , '' Burns said .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $ 848 billion bill . The 60-39 vote to prevent a Republican filibuster against the start of debate on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's legislation broke down along strict party lines . All 58 Senate Democrats -- along with independent Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- supported bringing the measure to the floor . Thirty-nine of the 40 Senate Republicans opposed the motion . Sen. George Voinovich , R-Ohio , did n't vote . `` Tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiraling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , '' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement . The polarized vote set the table for a holiday season now virtually certain to be marked by acrimonious deliberations on President Obama 's top domestic priority . Top Senate Democrats , who are trying to pass a bill before the end of the year , spent much of the day tarring their Republican colleagues as defenders of a broken status quo benefitting rich insurance companies at the expense of ordinary American families . Republicans , in turn , slammed Democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of Americans to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums , raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care . Read the health care bill -LRB- PDF -RRB- `` Today we -LSB- decide -RSB- whether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation , '' Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said shortly before the vote . `` Whether this nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free from fear of illness and death , which can be prevented by decent health care for all . '' The Republicans `` are frightening people , '' said Sen. Tom Harkin , D-Iowa . `` Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees . Now is the time to stand strong ... and move this country forward . '' `` This bill ... is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending , '' replied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky . It `` imposes punishing taxes on almost everyone . ... A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst of double digit unemployment . '' The bill `` does worse than nothing , '' said Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa . It `` threatens the economic recovery . ... Changes to the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs of the taxpayers . '' The procedural vote represented another milestone in what has become an epic battle over the future of America 's health care system . The House of Representatives narrowly passed a more than $ 1 trillion bill this month . If the Senate also manages to pass a bill , a congressional conference committee will then need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to Obama 's desk to be signed into law . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid 's 2,074-page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans . The agency estimates that the proposal would reduce the federal deficit by $ 130 billion over the next 10 years , through 2019 . Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be `` subject to substantial uncertainty , '' but probably would result in `` small reductions in federal budget deficits , '' according to budget office analysts . A minimum of 60 votes is required to break a filibuster in the 100-member Senate . The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon , when Sen. Blanche Lincoln , D-Arkansas , announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure . Lincoln , a key moderate probably facing a tough re-election campaign in 2010 , said the issue deserved further debate and consideration . She made clear , however , that she opposes several aspects of Reid 's bill , including a controversial government-run public option . `` Although I do n't agree with everything in this bill , I believe it is important to begin debate , '' Lincoln said . `` The issue is very complex . There is no easy fix . '' Republicans wasted no time tearing into Lincoln 's vote , issuing a news release while she was still announcing her decision , proclaiming that she had caved to `` pressure from the left wing of her party . '' `` There 's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen. Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid , '' said Amber Wilkerson Marchand , a GOP spokeswoman . `` The people of Arkansas will have an opportunity to hold her accountable when they cast their ballots next November . '' Two other Democratic moderates whose support was considered to be in doubt -- Nebraska 's Ben Nelson and Louisiana 's Mary Landrieu -- also announced their decision to back a full debate shortly before the vote . Reid 's bill , projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans , includes a range of tax increases and new fees . The Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning $ 200,000 a year and couples earning $ 250,000 a year would increase by half a percentage point , from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent . In addition , insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as Cadillac plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on policies worth more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families . The bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery , as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers . The total projected revenue raised by all the taxes and fees would exceed $ 200 billion . The bill would require individuals to buy health insurance , with a fine for non-compliance of $ 95 in the first year that would escalate to $ 750 by 2016 . Unlike the plan recently passed by the House , the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care . Businesses with more than 50 workers , where at least one employee qualifies for government subsidies , would face a penalty of $ 750 for every full-time employee if it does not offer health care coverage . Reid 's bill also would expand government-run Medicaid coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level . Democratic leaders in both chambers have been wrestling with the most contentious issues , including abortion and immigration , as well as how to pay for reform . The House bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $ 500,000 and couples earning more than $ 1 million . Both bills include a government-run public option , but the Senate version allows states to opt out before the national program would go into effect in 2014 . The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes , including creating health insurance exchanges , expanding Medicaid , subsidizing insurance for low - and some middle-income families , and capping out-of-pocket medical expenses while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history .","question":""}
{"answer":"One doctor says the study `` very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine . '' A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999 , suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder . Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007 . The preservative , thimerosal , has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001 , except for some flu shots . The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups , who have long blamed mercury , a neurotoxin , for the disorder . For years , parents have been concerned that a mercury-containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism . But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines . The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism , although advocacy groups say it 's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected . Do these findings suggest that autism is n't linked to mercury in vaccines ? Dr. Sanjay Gupta , chief medical correspondent : Let me explain . In 1999 , manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines . Some people believed autism would decrease as a result , because they thought the two were connected . A new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry says this just did n't happen . Researchers looked at cases of autism in California after 1999 . They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism , the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed . Just the opposite happened . From 2004 to 2007 , when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3 - to 5-year-olds , the autism rate continued to go up , from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California . A child psychiatrist who supported the study said it `` very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine . '' But advocacy groups say it 's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines . The National Vaccine Information Center says the study does n't include children under the age of 3 , which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines . It says thimerosal was n't completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003 . Their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin , so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines ? What do scientists think causes autism ? As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism , and doctors still do n't know why . Doctors point to genetics and environment as culprits , but it could be more complicated than that . The latest research shows these children are not necessarily born with autism but with the potential to develop it . What exactly are these outside factors ? It 's hard to pinpoint . What we eat , what we breathe , what we drink -- all these things could play a role . Some doctors say the increase is due to a change in the way the condition is diagnosed kids who were once labeled mentally retarded are now being labeled as autistic . What are possible signs of autism in your child ? Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months . Some red flags that indicate your child may have autism : no babbling or pointing by 12 months , no single words by 16 months , no brief phrases by 24 months , loss of language or social skills . If you see any of these signs , the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends seeing a pediatric neurologist , developmental pediatrician or child psychologist . What led companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines to begin with ? Several things pushed companies in this direction . Over the past decade , more and more attention was given to the health effects of mercury on humans . And then in the '90s , the CDC added new vaccines to the list of routine shots that children should get . Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative . This was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury . So the FDA began looking into the issue . In 1997 , Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury , which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia . Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan , pictured on the FBI 's Web site , reportedly was tied to al Qaeda 's East Africa operations . Intelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed , Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday . `` We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers , and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia , '' Gelle said . Nabhan 's death will have `` a major impact '' on al Qaeda 's operations in the Horn of Africa , according to one regional analyst . U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia , killing several people , including one they believed was Nabhan , U.S. officials told CNN earlier . Nabhan , 30 , was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , according to the sources . More than 200 were killed , and 4,000 wounded in those attacks , most of them Kenyans . The United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008 , U.S. officials said at the time . In February 2006 , the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa , Kenya . Ten Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa 's Paradise Hotel in November 2002 . The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet , which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members . President Obama signed off on Monday 's operation , a senior U.S. official said . The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area , the U.S. officials said . The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday 's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media . The U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore , while the ship kept watch on the operation , one of the sources said . The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble . Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe , Somalia , said they witnessed the assault . They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died . The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter . A U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification . Nabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul , who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies . The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda 's East African operations , a senior U.S. official said last year . `` He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa , '' said Rashid Abdi , a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group , an independent advisory and analysis organization . Nabhan `` has been living in the shadows '' in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity , Abdi said . `` The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab , '' he said , referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda . `` He is a man with an important organizational memory , and if a key figure like him is killed , it always has a major impact . '' Al-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia 's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties . There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan . CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives . Journalist Mohammed Amiin Adow and CNN 's David McKenzie , Barbara Starr and Ed Henry contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno said Sunday the string of sexual child abuse charges against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky are `` shocking . '' Sandusky , 67 , allegedly engaged in fondling , oral and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years , according to an investigative state grand jury 's summary of testimony . He maintains he is innocent . Also named in the state grand jury report are Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley , 57 , and Gary Schultz , 62 , the university 's senior vice president for finance and business . They face one count of perjury each in connection to an alleged cover-up of the abuse . `` If true , the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all Penn Staters . While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved I ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , '' Paterno said in a statement . The legendary coach said an assistant coach told him in 2002 about an `` incident in the shower of our locker room facility . '' `` It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report . Regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky . As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time , I referred the matter to university administrators , '' Paterno said . Sandusky , who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions , faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , and numerous other charges , including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child . In some cases , Sandusky promised boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers , according to the grand jury . `` One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002 , in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus , '' Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday . `` Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old , '' she said . The assistant reported the incident to head football coach Paterno , who in turn alerted athletic director Curley , said Kelly . Instead of reporting the incident to authorities , Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building , Kelly said . Sandusky , who retired from coaching in 1999 , was founder of the Second Mile , a charitable organization that began as a group foster home `` dedicated to helping troubled boys , '' the grand jury states .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration will ask Congress for another $ 83.4 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the end of September , Democratic congressional sources said Thursday . President Obama 's spending measure is likely to be the last supplemental request submitted to pay for the wars . The request is expected to pay for those conflicts for the rest of the 2009 budget year , two Democratic congressional sources said . The money would bring the running tab for both conflicts to about $ 947 billion , according to figures from the Congressional Research Service . More than three-quarters of the $ 864 billion appropriated so far has gone to the war in Iraq , the agency estimated . Since taking office in January , President Obama has announced plans to shift troops out of Iraq and beef up U.S. forces in Afghanistan , where American troops have been battling al Qaeda and Taliban fighters since al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks . In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Obama said the situation in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan `` demands urgent attention . '' `` The Taliban is resurgent , and al Qaeda threatens America from its safe haven along the Afghan-Pakistan border , '' Obama wrote in submitting the funding request . `` There is no question of the resolve of our military women and men . Yet , in Afghanistan , that resolve has not been matched by a comprehensive strategy and sufficient resources , '' Obama wrote . About $ 75 billion of the latest request would pay for military operations , including $ 9.8 billion for body armor and protective vehicles and $ 11.6 billion to replace worn-out equipment . The rest would go to diplomatic programs and development aid -- including $ 1.6 billion for Afghanistan , $ 1.4 billion for Pakistan and $ 700 million for Iraq . The request would also provide about $ 800 million for the Palestinian Authority , including humanitarian aid for Gaza , the Hamas-ruled territory that was heavily bombarded by Israel in December and January ; $ 800 million to support U.N. peacekeeping missions in Africa ; and $ 30 million to the Department of Justice to manage the closure of the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . The supplemental spending bill is likely to be the last such request submitted to Congress to pay for the wars , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said . While the Bush administration relied on supplemental spending bills to fund the conflicts , Obama began including war spending in his 2010 budget . The president urged Congress to move quickly on the request `` and not to use the supplemental to pursue unnecessary spending . '' But Rep. Lynn Woolsey , a prominent anti-war Democrat , said the requested funding would `` prolong our occupation of Iraq through at least the end of 2011 , '' when U.S. troops are scheduled to leave the country , `` and it will deepen and expand our military presence in Afghanistan indefinitely . '' `` Instead of attempting to find military solutions to the problems we face in Iraq and Afghanistan , President Obama must fundamentally change the mission in both countries to focus on promoting reconciliation , economic development , humanitarian aid , and regional diplomatic efforts . '' Last month , Obama announced the United States plans to withdraw most of its troops from Iraq by the end of August 2010 . A residual force of between 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain until December 31 , 2011 . There are 142,000 American troops in Iraq now . Obama has ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops to fight the Taliban in the south and east and 4,000 more to train Afghan troops .","question":""}

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are around 200 known types of cancers . Some are far more widespread than others . Australian Professor Ian Frazer has developed a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and is working on a vaccine for skin cancer . Cancer researchers are making significant breakthroughs in unlocking the complete genetic makeup of many common cancers . Through extensive studies and research , they are understanding exactly how the rogue cells differ from normal cells , and modifying treatments so they work on just the cancer cells . We take a look at some of the most common types of cancers plus some possible causes , treatments and developments . Lung Cancer Lung cancer develops when cells of the lungs divide and grow in an uncontrolled manner . There are two types of lung cancer : non-small cell lung cancer -LRB- NSCLC -RRB- and small cell lung cancer -LRB- SCLC -RRB- . The latter is more likely to spread further in the body in its early stages . Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide , according to the World Health Organization , with 1.2 million new cases every year . Nearly all lung cancers arise because of smoking and men have always been more affected by lung cancer than women . However , a rise in female smoking worldwide has started reversing the trend . Treatments Not all lung-cancer patients are suitable for surgery . Surgery on non-small cell lung cancers is more common than in small cell lung cancer , but can still only happen in a minority of cases . Other options are radio therapy and chemotherapy . Developments In December 2008 , scientists pinpointed a gene that protects against lung cancer . It is hoped the discovery of the role of the tumor suppressor gene -- LIMD1 -- may lead to new treatments and techniques to pick up the disease earlier . The disease is often not picked up until it has reached an advanced stage and many patients die within a year of being diagnosed . Skin Cancer Skin cancer is a malignant growth on the skin . It generally develops in the outermost layer of skin , so a tumor is usually clearly visible and easier to detect than most other cancers . Skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of the disease , surpassing lung , breast , colorectal and prostate cancer . Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that usually starts within a mole or a dark spot on the skin . If found early , simple surgical treatment works well and usually leads to a cure , the British Medical Journal advises . However they can spread quickly and are responsible for the majority of skin-cancer-related deaths . It 's not entirely clear why skin cancers develop , but according to the U.S. National Institute of Health , UV radiation from the sun is the main cause . UV radiation is particularly harmful for children and teenagers and even a short exposure can lead to skin cancer much later in life . Diagnosis and Treatment Diagnosis is made with a skin biopsy , under local anesthetic with an injection . Treatment depends on the circumstances of the cancer and the patient ; including age , type of cancer and location . Treatments can include , amongst others , radiotherapy -LRB- radiation -RRB- , chemotherapy -LRB- pills -RRB- and surgery . Developments Scientists have recently conducted experiments on `` immune-priming , '' -- using the patients ' own immune systems to fight the skin cancer . This therapy is still relatively new , but has been shown to boost the immune system and thereby attack skin cancers and viruses . The Australian scientist who developed a vaccine for cervical cancer , Ian Frazer , told Australia 's Medical Research Congress in November 2008 that he is working on a skin cancer vaccine that could be available within a decade . Breast Cancer Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the breast tissue , leading to damage to the cells ' DNA . This results in cell division and growth and eventually leads to the formation of a lump . The malignant cells can then invade other organs where metastases -LRB- secondary lumps -RRB- may form . Breast cancer is the most common in women , affecting one in nine women at some point in their lives . The World Health Organization states that breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths , causing 502,000 deaths worldwide in 2005 . Diagnosis and Treatment Women are encouraged to check their breasts regularly for any lumps or other irregularities , such as discharge from the nipple . General practitioners or gynecologists can also do physical checks . To make a diagnosis , doctors can perform a mammogram or an ultrasound and take a tissue sample . Once a lump has been identified as malignant , the most common treatments are surgery , radiation therapy and chemotherapy . Developments Interstitial laser thermotherapy -LRB- ILT -RRB- is a relatively new minimally invasive , laser surgery procedure that reduces the possibility of complications during and after an operation . Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer develops in the prostate , a gland in the male reproductive system . It occurs when cells of the prostate mutate and begin to multiply out of control . These cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body . Rates of prostate cancer vary widely across the world and are most common in Europe and the United States . It is least common in South and East Asia , according to the figures from Cancer Research UK . A quarter of all new cases of cancer diagnosed in British men are prostate cancers . Almost 60 per cent of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed in men aged over 70 years . Diagnosis and Treatment Prostate cancer is most often discovered by prostate specific antigen -LRB- PSA -RRB- screening and less commonly by physical examination through the rectum or by the appearance of symptoms . Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on the age of the man , his health and the spread of the cancer . The most common treatments are surgery and radiation therapy . Colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer , also called colon cancer or large bowel cancer , includes cancerous growths in the colon , rectum and appendix . According to the WHO , colorectal cancer causes 655,000 deaths worldwide per year and is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world Risk factors and symptoms According to the American Cancer Society , the following factors increase the risk for colorectal cancer : \u2022 Age : Most cases occur in people in their 60s and 70s . Cases in people aged 50 or under are uncommon unless a family history of early colon cancer is present . \u2022 Women who have had cancer of the ovary , uterus , or breast have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer . \u2022 A history of colorectal cancer in the family \u2022 Smoking Treatment Surgery is the primary treatment , while radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be applied depending on the patient , the tumor 's stage and other medical factors . If performed at a late stage or when the cancer has already spread , colorectal cancer is unlikely to be cured with surgery .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Republicans ' tough task of taking back control of the Senate next year now looks even tougher . Sen. Pete Domenici , R-New Mexico , says he will retire at the end of his term . Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico announced Thursday that he will not seek re-election . `` For the past 35 years my friends and neighbors have given me the honor of allowing me to serve them as their United States senator , '' he said . `` Who could ask for anything more ? Domenici joins three other Republican senators who also are retiring at the end of their terms next year . Democrats took back both houses of Congress last November , but hold thin majorities . In the Senate , they have a 51-49 margin . Their advantage in the House of Representatives is 233-202 . Of 34 Senate seats being contested next year , Republicans hold 22 . With the four senators retiring and four others facing difficult re-election bids , the numbers are stacked against GOP hopes of recapturing the upper chamber of Congress . Read more about the senators who are retiring '' Domenici , a six-term senator , earlier had hinted he would run for re-election despite some criticism of his role in the controversial firings of U.S. attorneys . One of the prosecutors , David Iglesias , contends Domenici and U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson , R-New Mexico , wanted him to push harder on a corruption investigation of state Democrats before the 2006 midterm elections . Iglesias said he felt `` leaned on '' when Domenici called him to inquire about when indictments would be brought . The senator , who nominated Iglesias for the post , apologized for making the call but said he never pressured Iglesias . Domenici said he had complained to Justice Department officials about the pace of prosecutions in Iglesias ' office . Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Domenici had complained to him about Iglesias in the fall of 2005 , saying the U.S. attorney `` was in over his head . '' Iglesias , a Naval Reserve lawyer listed in a Justice Department evaluation as a `` diverse up-and-comer '' before 2006 , was told to resign that December . Domenici , 75 , was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and has n't faced a tough re-election battle since then . But New Mexico 's other senator , Jeff Bingaman , is a Democrat , as is Gov. Bill Richardson , who is running for president , and Democrats are likely to pour a lot of resources into trying to capture Domenici 's seat . Republicans also face tough competition to hold onto the seats of retiring senators in Nebraska , Virginia and Colorado . In Nebraska , former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns has told friends he will run for retiring Sen. Chuck Hagel 's seat . Johanns is a former Nebraska governor , and Hagel said he has encouraged him to run . Nebraska Attorney General John Bruning had planned to run against Hagel and still could run against Johanns for the Republican nomination . Two other Republicans are also in the hunt for the open seat . Former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey also is considering running for Hagel 's seat . President Bush handily carried Nebraska in his 2004 re-election , but an unpopular war and an unpopular president could give the Democrats hope next year . The state 's other senator , Ben Nelson , is a Democrat . In Virginia , where longtime Republican Sen. John Warner is retiring , Democratic former Gov. Mark Warner , no relation to the senator , intends to run for the open seat . Mark Warner 's term as governor ended in January 2006 , and he left office with high favorable ratings . Democrats have won three major statewide elections there this decade . In 2006 , Democrat Jim Webb ousted Republican Sen. George Allen by a margin of fewer than 10,000 votes , or less than half a percentage point . Webb 's victory helped give Democrats their slim Senate majority . On the Republican side , there could be a bitter primary fight between Rep. Tom Davis , a moderate from northern Virginia , and conservative former Gov. Jim Gilmore , who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year . In Colorado , Sen. Wayne Allard announced this year that he 's retiring after his term finishes , and Democrats made major gains there in the 2004 and 2006 elections . In addition to those races , tough re-election fights lie ahead for Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine , John Sununu of New Hampshire , Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Gordon Smith of Oregon . As of now , only one Senate Democrat -- Mary Landrieu of Louisiana -- appears to face a challenge . The recent scandal involving Sen. Larry Craig 's arrest in an airport restroom should not hurt the GOP 's chances of holding on to his Senate seat in Idaho in 2008 , even if the Republican does leave office . Democrats have n't won a Senate seat in Idaho in more than 30 years . Craig had said he would resign from the Senate if he could not get his guilty plea to a disorderly conduct charge withdrawn by September 30 . But last week , Craig said he would n't resign until `` legal determinations '' are made . On Thursday , a judge denied Craig 's request to withdraw his guilty plea . While the controversy over his arrest and guilty plea may not cost the GOP a Senate seat , it wo n't help his party either . E-mail to a friend","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Houston Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada is expected to plead guilty Wednesday in federal court to a count of lying to Congress about his knowledge of Major League Baseball players using performance-enhancing drugs , according to officials familiar with the case . Miguel Tejada , a shortstop for the Houston Astros , has been charged with lying to Congress . In a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , Tejada is charged in a criminal `` information , '' a document that routinely signals a plea bargain agreement . The document does not directly accuse Tejada of using steroids or other substances . However , the court document says that in 2003 Tejada gave another player more than $ 5,000 in checks `` for substances which he believed to be HGH -LSB- human growth hormone -RSB- . '' The document says Tejada lied to congressional investigators when he told them on August 26 , 2005 , that he had never heard discussions about steroids by other players , and that he never knew of any other player using steroids . After the December 2007 Mitchell Report on steroid use in baseball , which appeared to contradict Tejada , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Tejada `` made knowingly false statements to the committee . '' The investigators concluded he had lied . `` Defendant Tejada unlawfully withheld pertinent information from the committee because defendant Tejada before and during his interview with the committee staff , then and there well knew that Player # 1 -LSB- unidentified -RSB- , one of his teammates on the Oakland Athletics , had used steroids and HGH , '' the document says . Tejada played for the Athletics from 1997 to 2003 . He is scheduled to appear at 11 a.m. Wednesday before a magistrate judge , indicating the charge against him will be a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of a year in jail . However , a government official familiar with the case said that under sentencing guidelines , Tejada could get from zero to 6 months , which means he may receive probation without jail time . Tejada , who started his MLB career in 1997 , hit at least 30 home runs from 2000 through 2004 with the exception of 2003 , when he hit 27 . He won the American League 's most valuable player award in 2002 , when he hit a career-best 34 home runs . He matched that total in 2004 , his first year with the Baltimore Orioles . He began playing with Houston in 2008 . The information came one day after MLB star Alex Rodriguez -- the New York Yankees ' third baseman since 2004 -- admitted that he had used a `` banned substance '' during the 2001-2003 seasons . Sports Illustrated had reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for steroids in 2003 , when he was playing for the Texas Rangers .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe , authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado 's Jensen Farms is safe . But if in doubt about a fruit 's origin , they said , it 's best to throw it out . The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12 . As of Wednesday , it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people , officials with the Centers for Disease Control said . The number of cases is expected to rise , as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms . All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada , Colorado , although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois , Wyoming , Tennessee , Utah , Texas , Colorado , Minnesota , Kansas , New Mexico , North Carolina , Missouri , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Arizona , New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania . `` It 's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms , then it 's OK to eat , '' CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday . `` But if you 're in doubt , then throw it out . '' The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says , `` Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe , '' or a gray , yellow and green sticker that says , `` Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords . '' But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker , Frieden said . Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from . If the cantaloupe 's origins remain unconfirmed , it should be disposed of , he said . However , the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation 's food supply is decreasing , thanks to the fruit 's short shelf life -- about two weeks , officials said . The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10 , `` so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product , '' Sherri McGarry , a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- , told reporters . The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves , she said , but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer . `` But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect , '' she said . If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms , authorities recommend they do n't try to wash off the bacteria . `` We want you to throw that product away , '' McGarry said . The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can , to prevent people or animals from eating them , the CDC said . Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria , which can grow even at low temperatures , officials said . And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator , the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow . `` It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces '' in order to minimize risk , the FDA says on its website . After washing refrigerators , cutting boards and countertops , the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used . Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season , so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market , FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday . Although Jensen Farms does produce other products , there is no concern for any other product from the company , McGarry said . Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults , the CDC said , but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems . It can be treated with antibiotics . The source of the outbreak -- the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation . Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled .","question":""}
{"answer":"Editor 's note : Dr. John Boyce , chief of the Infectious Diseases Section at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven , Connecticut , was lead author of the Centers for Disease Control 's national hand hygiene guidelines for health-care workers and heads the Hand Hygiene Resource Center . Dr. John Boyce says hands contaminated with virus are often a pathway for people to develop flu . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus -LRB- also known as swine flu -RRB- from Mexico to at least 19 other countries in less than 10 days is a cause of major concern . It emphasizes the need for the public to become familiar with how influenza is spread and which preventive measures they can use to reduce their chances of becoming infected . Although little information is available at this time , it appears that this influenza virus spreads from one person to another in the same way as other influenza viruses -- by `` droplet spread . '' Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes and expels droplets of fluid . Those droplets travel short distances -LRB- usually less than three feet -RRB- through the air and can be deposited on the mouth or in the nose of people or on surfaces . Those who develop influenza often shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions for several days after they become ill . Experience with other viruses suggests that individuals with influenza can contaminate their hands when coughing , sneezing or blowing their noses . The virus can survive on the hands for at least one hour . If a person whose hands are heavily contaminated touches a surface such as a doorknob , table or computer keyboard , they can deposit the virus onto that surface , where it can survive for minutes to several hours . One study conducted with a regular seasonal strain of influenza virus found that the virus could survive on facial tissues for several minutes and for two to eight hours on stainless steel or plastic surfaces . If another person touches a contaminated surface with his hands when the virus is still alive and then touches his own mouth or nose , he may become infected . Infection might also occur when a person with influenza shakes hands with another person who subsequently touches their own mouth or nose with their fingers . Several studies have found that many people touch their noses or mouths several times an hour during the course of daily activities . So there are plenty of opportunities for people to inadvertently introduce a flu virus into their bodies if their hands become contaminated . As a result , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- recommends that individuals perform hand hygiene -- also known as hand washing or decontamination -- frequently during influenza outbreaks . In addition to reducing the risk of developing influenza , hand hygiene can help protect people from becoming ill with several other respiratory viruses by eliminating these organisms from the hands . A recent study found that hand washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer were both highly effective in reducing a seasonal strain of influenza virus on the hands . This should also be true for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus . Either plain soap or antimicrobial soap will reduce the amount of virus on the hands . To ensure decontamination , be sure to wash your hands vigorously and keep both soap and water on your hands for at least 15 seconds . When sinks are not readily available , alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a convenient and effective way of eliminate the virus from hands . Use an amount of sanitizer at least the size of quarter or enough to keep your hands wet for at least 15 to 20 seconds while you 're rubbing them together . The CDC also recommends that people should avoid touching their mouths , noses and eyes , since surfaces they touch may be contaminated when flu virus is present . People who develop influenza or other respiratory viral infections should also clean their hands after blowing their nose or after covering a cough with their hands . Since droplet spread is the most common way influenza is transmitted from person to person , the CDC also recommends avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick . If you do become ill with influenza , the CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others . Hand hygiene is an important tool in preventing infection from influenza viruses such as this recent strain and is an easy and effective way to prevent contracting infectious diseases in general . Take the time to educate yourself about proper hand hygiene to protect both yourself and your family . Note : Further information about the 2009 H1N1 influenza -LRB- swine flu -RRB- outbreak can be obtained by going to CDC 's Web site . For general information about hand hygiene in health-care settings , go to this CDC site or this Hand Hygiene Resource Center site .

Redgrave , 67 , was surrounded by her children at her Connecticut home when she died , the family said in a statement Monday morning . The star of stage , film and television was twice nominated for an Academy Award : for best actress in 1966 for her role in `` Georgy Girl '' and for best supporting actress in the 1998 film `` Gods and Monsters . '' `` She lived , loved and worked harder than ever before , '' the family said . `` The endless memories she created as a mother , grandmother , writer , actor and friend will sustain us for the rest of our lives . Our entire family asks for privacy through this difficult time , '' the statement said . Redgrave is from `` a family of actors , embracing as it does more than five generations , '' she wrote on her official website . She is the younger sister of Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave and the aunt of the late actress Natasha Richardson . Her parents , Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson , were British stage and film actors . Her paternal grandparents , Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore , were stage and silent film actors . Redgrave teamed with daughter Annabel Clark in 2004 to produce the book `` Journal : A Mother and Daughter 's Recovery from Breast Cancer . '' `` I thought I was living very fully before this happened , '' she said in 2005 . `` But in comparison , no , I really was n't . I was n't taking the time to notice things . I did n't see things as brightly or as sharply or as memorably as I do now . `` I really do n't let a moment slide by . I just do n't . It 's a big price to pay , is n't it , to have to have cancer to learn that ? But it is in the end , I have to say , a price worth paying , '' Redgrave said . Redgrave 's professional acting debut was in 1962 at London 's Royal Court Theatre in a production of `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream . '' A year later , she was invited to join Britain 's National Theatre for its inaugural season under the direction of Sir Laurence Olivier , according to her personal biography . Her first film performance came in `` Tom Jones , '' a 1963 movie co-starring Albert Finney and her mother . Redgrave 's `` Georgy Girl '' role three years later , opposite James Mason , earned her a best actress Golden Globe and the Academy Award best actress nomination . Her portrayal of a wisecracking young woman was a box office hit . Other early film roles included `` The National Health , '' `` Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex , '' `` The Happy Hooker '' and `` Getting It Right . '' Redgrave enjoyed a revitalized film career late in life . She won a second Golden Globe and her second Oscar nomination for her comedic role in `` Gods and Monsters . '' She continued to make movies despite her illness , including her last film role in `` Confessions of a Shopaholic , '' which hit theaters a year ago . Redgrave debuted on Broadway in 1967 in `` Black Comedy . '' The first of three Tony nominations came in 1976 for `` Mrs. Warren 's Profession . '' She was nominated again for her Broadway roles in `` Shakespeare for My Father '' in 1993 and `` The Constant Wife '' in 2005 . She teamed with her sister Vanessa Redgrave on the London stage in `` Three Sisters '' in 1991 . The sisters worked together the same year in a television version of `` Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? '' Her three Emmy nominations all came for TV work in the 1980s , including an episode of `` House Calls '' in 1981 , `` The Shooting Company '' in 1982 and `` Walking on Air '' in 1987 .

{"answer":"PALO ALTO , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize helps underscore the urgency of the climate crisis , said former Vice President Al Gore on Friday . `` This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now , '' said Al Gore . Gore 's comments came hours after the Nobel committee announced he would share the award with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their work to raise awareness about global warming . `` This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now , '' Gore said , speaking to reporters in Palo Alto , California . `` It truly is a planetary emergency , and we have to respond quickly . '' The former vice president said he would donate his half of the $ 1.5 million prize to the Alliance for Climate Protection , an organization he founded to persuade people to reduce global warming by cutting pollution . `` That amount is very small compared to the enormous challenge that lies ahead , '' Gore said , including organizing a massive grass-roots movement and a mass advertising campaign focused on `` trying to change the way people think . '' Watch Gore describe what he calls a ` planetary emergency ' '' Earlier Friday , a White House spokesman said President Bush was pleased that Gore , Bush 's opponent in the 2000 presidential race , had won the award . `` Of course , he 's happy for Vice President Gore , happy for the International Panel on Climate Change scientists , who also shared the Peace Prize , '' White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said . `` Obviously it 's an important recognition , and we 're sure the vice president is thrilled . '' Fratto said Bush would not be under any pressure to adopt mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions , a policy Gore has advocated . Gore 's ex-boss , former President Clinton , also said he 's `` thrilled by this well-deserved recognition , '' and credited Gore with `` warning and educating us about the dangers of climate change for decades . He saw this coming before others in public life . '' The Nobel committee 's announcement cited Gore and the IPCC `` for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change , and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change . '' The award ceremony will be held December 10 in Oslo , Norway . In recent weeks , Gore has been the target of a campaign to persuade him to enter the 2008 presidential race . A source involved in Gore 's past political runs told CNN that he definitely has the ambition to use the peace prize as a springboard to run for president . But he will not run , because he wo n't take on the political machine assembled by Sen. Hillary Clinton , said the source . If the senator from New York had faltered at all , Gore would take a serious look at entering the race , the source said . But Gore has calculated that Clinton is unstoppable , according to the source . Gore repeatedly denied he has any plans to run again , but this week a group of grass-roots Democrats calling themselves `` Draft Gore '' took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in a bid to change his mind . Watch Gore discuss global warming and politics `` Your country needs you now , as do your party , and the planet you are fighting so hard to save , '' the group said in an open letter . `` America and the Earth need a hero right now , someone who will transcend politics as usual and bring real hope to our country and to the world . '' The Nobel committee praised Gore as being `` one of the world 's leading environmentalist politicians . '' `` He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted , '' said Ole Danbolt Mjos , chairman of the Nobel committee . In making the announcement , Mjos said , `` Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades , the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming . `` Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming . '' Said Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the U.N. panel : `` This is an honor that goes to all the scientists and authors who have contributed to the work of the IPCC . '' Renate Christ , secretary of the panel , called the award `` the most significant recognition that the IPCC has received . '' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988 to study climate change information . The group does n't do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world . The U.N.-sanctioned group was formed by the World Meteorological Organization and U.N. Environment Program . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was `` delighted '' with the news that Gore and the IPCC will share in prize . The Nobel caps a series of prestigious awards associated with Gore , including two Oscars this year for the 2006 documentary film , `` An Inconvenient Truth , '' which followed him on a worldwide tour publicizing the dangers of climate change . Last month , he also picked up an Emmy -- the highest award in U.S. television -- for `` Current TV . '' The show , which Gore co-created , describes itself as a global television network giving viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming . Previous American recipients of the peace prize include former Presidents Carter in 2002 , Wilson in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 . In 1973 , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the award with North Vietnam 's Le Duc Tho . The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. received the honor in 1964 . See more on 2007 Nobel winners '' Gore was vice president for eight years before winning the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination and running against Bush . But he failed in his White House bid -- despite winning the popular vote -- when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his challenge over voting results in Florida , securing an Electoral College majority for Bush .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sonia Sotomayor , who rose from humble roots in a Bronx , New York , housing project to a high-powered legal career , was sworn in Saturday as the 111th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . Judge Sonia Sotomayor takes the judicial oath Saturday as her mother , Celina , holds the Bible . With friends and family looking on , the 55-year-old jurist took the judicial oath in the court 's wood-paneled East Conference Room , pledging to `` faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me . '' It was the first time such a ceremony was televised . Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 62-word oath required of all federal judges . In a private ceremony just moments before , Sotomayor took a separate , constitutional oath across the hall . Both oaths are necessary for her to assume her new duties . As her mother , Celina , held a ceremonial Bible , Sotomayor beamed as she waved to relatives and guests when she entered the room for the public ceremony . Among those in the room was her brother , Juan Sotomayor . Watch Sotomayor take the oath '' Roberts made brief preliminary remarks , telling the audience of about 60 that after the swearing-in , Sotomayor can `` begin her duties as an associate justice without delay . '' `` Congratulations and welcome to the court , '' he said afterward . Sotomayor made no statements and did not answer questions . She hugged her mother and several people in the front row . The newest justice can begin moving into her chambers and preparing for the upcoming fall term . The other justices plan to return early from their three-month recess to hear a case September 9 on free speech and campaign finance laws . Sources close to Sotomayor say she has already begun reading up on the caseload , and will soon formally hire four law clerks . She also will have two secretaries and a messenger to assist her . Justice Anthony Kennedy was the only current Supreme Court member on hand for the swearing-in ceremony . David Souter , whom Sotomayor replaces on the bench , was not there . He has retired to New Hampshire . The Senate confirmed Sotomayor on Thursday in a 68-31 vote . President Obama , who did not attend the swearing-in , will welcome his first high court appointee to the White House for a reception Wednesday . Watch Senate vote '' Obama , who selected Sotomayor on May 26 , said Thursday he was `` deeply gratified '' by the Senate vote . `` This is a wonderful day for Judge Sotomayor and her family , but I also think it 's a wonderful day for America , '' he said in brief remarks . Sotomayor , who watched Thursday 's final vote surrounded by friends and family at the federal courthouse in Manhattan , was confirmed after senators spent a final day of debate rehashing the main arguments for and against her . Democrats continued to praise Sotomayor as a fair and impartial jurist with an extraordinary life story . Many Republicans portrayed her as a judicial activist intent on reinterpreting the law to conform with her own liberal political beliefs . See how Sotomayor measures up to other justices '' Sotomayor 's confirmation capped an inspiring personal and professional journey . Her parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II . Her father worked in a factory and did not speak English well . She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project , not too far from the stadium of her favorite team , the New York Yankees . Her father died when she was 9 . Her mother , whom Sotomayor has described as her biggest inspiration , worked six days a week as a nurse to care for her and her younger brother . Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and attended Yale Law School , where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal . She worked at nearly every level of the judicial system over a three-decade career before being tapped by Obama . Her supporters touted her as someone with bipartisan favor and historic appeal . President George H.W. Bush named her a district judge in 1992 . She had served as a judge on the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1998 . Prior to her judicial appointments , Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes .","question":""}
{"answer":"Editor 's note : Kevin Fenton is director of the National Center for HIV\/AIDS , Viral Hepatitis , STD and TB Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Fenton has written for journals including The Lancet , AIDS , the British Medical Journal and the Journal of Infectious Diseases . After graduating from medical school , Fenton earned his Masters in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and his Ph.D. in Epidemiology from University College London . Dr. Kevin Fenton urges Americans to get tested for HIV . ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Every 9 1\/2 minutes someone 's brother , mother , sister , father , or neighbor becomes infected with HIV in the United States . That 's 56,000 people every year . But there 's something we can all do to help protect ourselves and our partners from this disease -- get tested for HIV . In the fight against HIV , I can tell you that few things are more important than testing . It 's an essential step in reducing the number of new HIV infections and extending the lives of those who are infected . Put simply , HIV testing saves lives . As a CDC official , I 've spoken with hundreds of people who have made the decision to get tested . Many described the relief they felt when they found out they were HIV-negative . Thanks to the HIV test , they could take steps to make sure they and their partners stay that way . I 've also met people who found out they were HIV-positive . Although initially worried about their diagnosis and their future , they were thankful they had their infection diagnosed early , and were able to live long , healthy and productive lives with HIV . They had the knowledge and will to protect their partners from infection , or to prevent their infants from becoming HIV infected . I recently met one young woman who learned about her HIV infection after being diagnosed during routine HIV testing in pregnancy . By getting tested early , and having access to effective treatment , her child was born without HIV , and she now has two healthy children . She is a living testament that life does not stop with this disease . Instead , knowledge of her HIV status along with effective treatment and care has given her the freedom , resolve and respect to make choices to protect her life and the lives of those she loves . Yet today , not everyone has benefited from knowing their HIV status . Far too many individuals with HIV do n't know that they 're infected . CDC estimates that one in five people with HIV in the United States is unaware of being infected . That 's more than 200,000 Americans who may be transmitting the virus to others without knowing it , and who ca n't take advantage of HIV treatments that could prolong and improve the quality of their lives . As we mark National HIV Testing Day on Saturday , I strongly encourage all Americans to get tested for HIV . At CDC , our goal is to make HIV testing as routine as a blood pressure check . HIV testing has never been quicker , easier or more accessible . In fact , with rapid HIV tests , results can be available in as little as 20 minutes , and tests can be given in your doctor 's office or other locations in your community , such as churches and college campuses . To ensure that all Americans know their HIV status , CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV as part of routine medical care -- regardless of their perceived risk for infection . CDC also recommends that those at increased risk , such as sexually active gay and bisexual men , get tested at least annually . We are also working with our partners to bring HIV testing services directly to communities across the nation . Increased HIV testing will make it possible to significantly reduce the number of new infections . Research indicates the majority of new sexually transmitted HIV infections are transmitted by people who do not know they are HIV-infected . Studies also show that most people who test HIV-positive take steps to protect their partners from infection . Nearly 30 years after the start of the epidemic , far too many people continue to be diagnosed late in the course of their infection . Too many times , I 've heard stories from people who went to the emergency room after a few days of flu-like symptoms . Once there , doctors conduct tests and inform them they have both pneumonia and AIDS . They never knew they were HIV infected , and yet they had the virus for years . In fact , data released today show that nearly 40 percent of people develop AIDS within just a year of being diagnosed with HIV . Many of these people could have stayed healthier if they were diagnosed with HIV and began drug treatment much earlier . Anti-retroviral treatment can lower the amount of the virus in the blood , slowing progression from HIV to AIDS . We must remember that AIDS still kills in this country -- more than 14,000 people die every year . Yet we have the tools to diagnose an HIV infection early , to begin life-prolonging treatments to prevent progression to AIDS , and to ensure a strong quality of life for HIV-infected people . But without a test , there is no diagnosis -- and no treatment . The fight against HIV here at home is far from over . But too many mistakenly believe that HIV in the United States is no longer a serious problem . In fact , a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found a troubling decline in awareness and concern about the domestic HIV\/AIDS crisis , in the general population and among those at greatest risk . To help combat this complacency , the White House recently joined CDC and the rest of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to announce a new communication campaign , `` Act Against AIDS . '' The campaign is working on a number of fronts to refocus national attention on the U.S. epidemic , and to increase the number of Americans who get tested for HIV . Although HIV\/AIDS continues to pose a serious threat to the nation 's health , HIV testing is a powerful weapon against the disease . By increasing the number of people who know their HIV status , we can decrease the number of new HIV infections , and help save thousands of lives . What you do n't know can hurt you . In fact , it can kill you . But a simple test could change your fate and the fate of others . That 's why today I urge all Americans to take the test -- and take control . To learn more about HIV\/AIDS and where you can receive a confidential HIV test , visit hivtest.org , call 800-CDC-INFO , or text your ZIP code to `` Know It '' -LRB- 566948 -RRB- .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia 's interim prime minister said Thursday that he has spoken to one of two French hostages seized earlier this week by gunmen who stormed their hotel in Mogadishu . Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said the government will hold Hizbul Islam responsible for the safety of both men . Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told a news conference at the presidential palace in the Somali capital that the hostage said he was in good health and is being treated well . Sharmarke said three low-level security officials have been arrested for their involvement in the kidnapping . The Somali government is negotiating the release of the hostages , who are being held by Islamist militants , he added . The two French nationals -- who have not been identified -- were abducted Tuesday when a group of about 10 armed men raided the hotel where they were staying . The French Foreign Ministry said the two were on an official mission to help the Somali government with security . The ministry has not divulged any details of its efforts to release the hostages , saying only that it is `` mobilized . '' The two advisers had apparently told the hotel they were journalists , something that the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders has criticized . `` We hope these two advisers are freed quickly , but we are shocked that they were passing themselves off as journalists , '' Reporters Without Borders said . `` They were on an official mission and had no need of cover . Their behavior endangers journalists in a region where media personnel are already in danger . '' Sharmarke said the two hostages were kidnapped by the militant group Hizbul Islam but later were transferred to Al-Shabaab . Both Islamic insurgencies are trying to topple the current Somali government . Eyewitnesses said a group of gunmen stormed into the Sahafi hotel , which is frequented by foreigners , and took the two blindfolded and bound hostages on foot toward Mogadishu 's Bakara market , a stronghold for Islamist insurgents fighting against the Somali government . The Somali prime minister said that the government will hold Hizbul Islam responsible for the safety of both men . He did not say if any demands had been made for the hostages ' release . Hizbul Islam is led by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , a bitter rival of Somalia 's transitional president , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed . The two men once shared leadership of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia , which opposed the presence of Ethiopian forces in Somalia . The alliance split because the two leaders disagreed over whether to use force to oust the Ethiopian forces . Hizbul Islam and Al-Shabaab have continued their fight in Somalia despite the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces earlier this year . The United Nations had hoped that the withdrawal of the Ethiopians and the election of Ahmed -- an Islamist -- to the post of transitional president would help quell the insurgency in Somalia . The Islamist insurgency is led by Al-Shabaab -- an al Qaeda-linked group that is on the United States ' terror list . It wants to overthrow Somalia 's weak , transitional government and implement a radical version of sharia , or Islamic law . Fighting in Somalia 's capital city has displaced 200,000 Mogadishu residents since early May , according to the United Nations . Journalist Mohamed Amin Adow contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of Cambodians packed a courtroom in Phnom Penh on Monday as three top Khmer Rouge leaders went on trial for their role during the bloody four-year regime in the mid-1970s . The U.N.-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia has scheduled four days of opening statements for the defendants , who are all in their 80s . On trial are Ieng Sary , the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister ; Khieu Samphon , the nominal head of state ; and Nuon Chea , the prime minister , also known as Brother Number 2 . The head of the Khmer Rouge , Pol Pot , was known as Brother Number 1 . He died in 1998 , long before the U.N.-backed court came into existence . A fourth defendant , Ieng Thirith , was ruled unfit to stand trial because she suffers from dementia and could be set free , prosecutor said . She is Sary 's wife and served as the social affairs ministry during the regime . Prosecutors have charged the defendants with crimes against humanity , grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions , genocide , homicide , torture and religious persecution . Under Pol Pot 's leadership , the Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces . In 1975 , the Khmer Rouge ordered people out of Phnom Penh , the capital , and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside . It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths , roughly a quarter of the population at the time . Its stated aim was to create a Communist utopia , but instead the regime forced Cambodians into what has been described as a living hell . Soldiers marched city-dwellers into the countryside and forced them to work as farm laborers . Those already living in rural Cambodia were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before . The regime abolished currency , and considered anyone with an education a threat . It did not allow modern medicine , and it isolated Cambodia to make it completely self-sufficient . The results were disastrous : People died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal . In the end , virtually everyone , including the soldiers , became a target due to the leadership 's paranoia .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After nearly 40 years of recorded increases , the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008 , recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show . The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased , partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election . According to the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey , the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008 , down from 12.6 percent in 2007 . Taking into account the margin of error , it was possible that the immigrant population remained even . `` Between '07 and '08 there really was n't that much of a change , '' said Elizabeth Grieco , chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau . But given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970 , no change is big news . The American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year , and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population , according to the bureau . The survey does n't give a reason for the leveling off , but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift . `` The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants ' decisions on whether to come to the U.S. , '' said Michelle Mittelstadt , director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute . Would-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now , Mittelstadt said . The largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession , including California , Florida and Arizona . Mittelstadt noted , however , that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying . A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico , the largest source of immigrants to the United States , slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008 , based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico , as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures . The Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008 , according to census data . The new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005 , the number of noncitizens decreased , Grieco said . There were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008 , down from 21.9 million in 2007 . The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants . Along with the decline in the noncitizen population , however , there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens , Grieco said . The number of individuals who are naturalized citizens increased to 43 percent of the foreign-born population in 2008 from 42.5 percent in 2007 . The Census survey matches reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the rise of naturalization applications . `` Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008 , with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States , '' according to a DHS statement . A significant fee increase imposed in 2007 for naturalization applications and an awareness of citizenship brought on during voter registration drives for the 2008 election help explain the increase , Mittelstadt said .","question":""}
{"answer":"WHITE OAK , Maryland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seeking to remove unapproved drugs from the marketplace , the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered nine companies to stop manufacturing narcotics whose therapeutic claims have not been proved . The FDA ordered nine companies to stop selling unapproved drugs marketed for pain relief . The FDA 's warning letters notified the companies they may be subject to legal action if they do not stop manufacturing and distributing `` prescription unapproved products '' that include high-concentrate morphine sulfate oral solutions and immediate-release tablets containing morphine sulfate , hydromorphone or oxycodone . This action does not include oxycodone capsules . All of these drugs are used for pain relief and are forms of previously approved medications . The agency says this is not a recall , but is instead a warning to manufacturers . The companies have 60 days to pull these pain-relief drugs from the market . Distributors have 90 days to stop shipping them . If these drugs are not off the market by those deadlines , a company could face seizure of the narcotics and legal action . `` We estimate there are several hundred unapproved drugs out there , '' said Deborah Autor , director of the office of compliance within the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research . `` We will continue to take aggressive action against those firms that do not have the required FDA approval for their drugs . Today 's warning letters are another demonstration of our commitment to remove illegal , unproved drugs from the market . '' Although the FDA does not know whether these drugs are unsafe , it has not approved them so can not certify that the products are 100 percent safe and effective . `` Consumers have a right to expect that their drugs meet the FDA 's safety and effectiveness standards , '' said Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research . `` Doctors and patients are often unaware that not all drugs on the market are backed by FDA approval . It is a high priority for the FDA to remove these products from the market because they may be unsafe , ineffective , inappropriately labeled , or of poor quality . '' The FDA believes Americans have access to plenty of legal narcotics for pain relief and removing these unapproved drugs will not create a shortage . Consumers who may be concerned that they are taking any unapproved drug products should refer to the FDA 's Unapproved Drugs Web page , which includes a list of manufacturers of these products . Those who find they are taking unapproved drugs should see their health care professionals for treatment options . Those companies receiving warning letters are Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc. , Columbus , Ohio ; Cody Laboratories Inc. , Cody , Wyoming ; Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Mahwah , New Jersey ; Lannett Company Inc. , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc. , Allentown , Pennsylvania ; Mallinckrodt Inc. .

Fifty-six percent of those questioned in a CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday said they favor the stimulus package that President-elect Barack Obama is proposing ; 42 percent were opposed .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attorneys on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate faced off Monday in a federal appeals court in California , as a panel of judges heard arguments about the constitutionality of Proposition 8 . In August , a federal judge ruled that the voter-approved measure , which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , violated the U.S. Constitution . The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered an appeal of that judge 's ruling Monday . The three-judge panel opened Monday 's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision , including ProtectMarriage.com and Isabel Vargas , who 's a deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Imperial County , California , where voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 8 . `` What 's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court ? '' one judge asked attorney Charles Cooper , representing ProtectMarriage.com . `` Your honor , I do n't have a case , '' Cooper responded , referring to relevant court cases . Cooper later urged the panel to consider how the California Supreme Court earlier ruled in favor of the voter-approved Proposition 8 . `` If you do n't agree with me that we have standing , '' Cooper told the court , `` then I do urge you to answer the California Supreme Court decision . '' Then Judge Stephen Reinhardt questioned attorney Robert Tyler , who represented Vargas , about how a deputy clerk , instead of the clerk , could have legal standing in the appeal . After a lengthy exchange , Reinhardt appeared frustrated and stated : `` If you do n't know the answer , say so , as the prior attorney did . '' In asserting that his client has standing in the appeal , Tyler told the court that the county clerks are local officers , but they perform state functions such as civil marriages . Monday 's arguments in San Francisco , California , were being divided into two hour-long sessions -- one over the legal standing of those appealing the decision , and one over the constitutionality of Proposition 8 . Monday 's hearing is the latest in a lengthy legal battle over same-sex marriage in California . The state 's high court had allowed same-sex marriage , but then the 2008 Proposition 8 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote . The California Supreme Court subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people . Two same-sex couples filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection . On August 4 , U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker agreed , ruling that the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution . `` Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license , '' Walker , who was appointed to the federal bench by former President George H.W. Bush , wrote in his 136-page opinion . `` Indeed , the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples . '' Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia . The five states are Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont , Iowa and New Hampshire . Walker 's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court .","question":""}
{"answer":"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amanda Knox will testify Friday in an Italian courtroom to defend herself against charges that she took part in the killing of her roommate two years ago , her lawyer said . American college student Amanda Knox , 21 , is expected to take the witness stand Friday at her Italian murder trial . Knox , 21 , an American college student from Seattle , Washington , will be questioned by her attorneys first and her testimony could continue Saturday , said Luciano Ghriga , one of her lawyers . The trial against Knox and her Italian former boyfriend , Raffaele Sollecito , 24 , began January 16 in Perugia , a university town about 185 kilometers -LRB- 115 miles -RRB- north of Rome . They are charged with murder and sexual assault in the November 2007 slaying of Knox 's roommate , British exchange student Meredith Kercher , who died in what prosecutors called a `` drug-fueled sex game '' with the couple . A third person , Rudy Hermann Guede , from the Ivory Coast , was convicted of murder in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison . Kercher was found dead in her bed , half-naked , with a knife wound to her neck . In court papers , prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her . Prosecutors say they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene , and that they gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died . Knox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher , then changed her story , according to court records . Sollecito , meanwhile , said he was never at the house , but was at his apartment , watching a movie on his computer with Knox . Later , he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night . Defense lawyers are expected to argue that the physical evidence was tainted by sloppy police work . The case is being heard by a panel of eight judges . The trial has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia , Italy . The presiding judge in the case , Giancarlo Massei , has barred cameras from the courtroom and said he could completely close portions of the trial dealing with the most graphic sexual assault allegations .","question":""}

She was 76 . Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg . Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s . Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma . He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal . He was acquitted in a second trial . His retrial in 1985 received national attention . `` We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , '' said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie `` Ala '' Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman . `` She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members .

Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England . Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said . The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over-the-counter painkillers and fever reducers will now carry new labels warning consumers of the potential risks of liver damage and internal bleeding associated with the drugs , according to a final ruling Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration . The new warning labels will affect over-the-counter pain relievers including Tylenol , aspirin and ibuprofen . The new rule covers acetaminophen , the popular pain medicine also known as Tylenol , and a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs . The most commonly used NSAIDs include aspirin , ibuprofen -LRB- the main ingredient in Motrin and Advil -RRB- , naproxen and ketoprofen . The modified labeling also applies to all products that contain these ingredients , such as cough and cold medicines . Under the new rule , package labels and bottles must prominently state in highlighted text the drug 's ingredients . For acetaminophen , the label must include bold lettering warning patients about severe liver damage . The new labeling also instructs patients using the blood thinner warfarin to consult their doctor before using acetaminophen . Bold lettering on NSAIDs labels must warn of severe stomach bleeding . `` Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are commonly used drugs for both children and adults because they are effective in reducing fevers and relieving minor aches and pain , such as headaches and muscle aches , '' said Dr. Charles Ganley , director of nonprescription drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research . `` However , the risks associated with their use need to be clearly identified on the label so that consumers taking these drugs are fully aware of the potential harm they can cause . It is important that they know how to take these medications safely to reduce their risk . '' The new labeling for acetaminophen also warns against taking multiple drugs that contain acetaminophen at the same time and exceeding the recommended dosage of the drug . And , it warns that drinking alcohol -- three or more drinks a day -- while using the painkiller can increase the risk of liver damage . For NSAIDs , the new labels will also caution users that alcohol use and taking the drugs for longer than directed can increase the risk of stomach bleeding . The agency says the use of blood thinning drugs or steroids while taking NSAIDs can also increase the risk of internal bleeding . The American Pain Foundation is pleased with the new rule . `` This ruling will not only help protect consumers using OTC pain medication on a periodic basis , '' APF said , `` But will be especially meaningful for people suffering from chronic pain who may face co-morbid conditions and are taking OTC pain medication along with their prescribed pain medication . '' According to the FDA , some manufacturers have already voluntarily started listing some of these risks on their product labels . The new rule gives manufacturers one year from today 's date to re-label their products .","question":""}

{"answer":"Researchers may be getting closer to an effective way of preventing age-related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision loss among older Americans . A new study found that vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid may help prevent age-related macular degeneration . A new study finds that women who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had lower risks of developing age-related macular degeneration . The women who got the supplements , compared with those taking a placebo , had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD , and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD . Epidemiologist and study author William G. Christen , Sc.D. , of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School , expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies , `` the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age-related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking . '' Christen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older , there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men . Christen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD . The 5,442 women who participated in the randomized , double-blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease . The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study , which lasted more than 7 years . Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system , and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors . Age-related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60 , involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula , the central part of the retina . The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly , as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision . `` If you affect that central part of your vision , no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life , '' explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld , ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology . There are two types of macular degeneration : wet and dry . Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula , which can rupture and bleed . The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function . While some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease -LRB- including laser surgery , photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye -RRB- , there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form . When asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid , retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet . `` If you do anything , I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A , E , C and zinc , '' suggests Frank , who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry . These antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age-related macular degeneration in the 10-year Age-Related Eye Disease Study conducted by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health . However , Frank does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the B vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early AMD from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years , after a large-scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. State Department has sold its London embassy building to a Qatari real estate company , the embassy announced Tuesday . The signing of the deal is another major step in the embassy 's plans to relocate from its longtime headquarters in central London to a new site in Wandsworth , on the south bank of the River Thames . It was n't immediately clear how much Qatari Diar Real Estate paid for the embassy building in Grosvenor Square , whose 1960s facade was recently given listed status , meaning its design ca n't be changed . The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017 , the embassy said . Construction is expected to begin in 2012 or 2013 . It was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern , open , and secure than the current building in London 's West End . It has now settled on a site in Wandsworth and is having a design competition for the new building . When the embassy does move to Wandsworth , it will mark the end of a more than 200-year association with Grosvenor Square , in the historic and exclusive neighborhood of Mayfair near Hyde Park . John Adams , who later became U.S. president , lived on the square from 1785 to 1788 , when he was the first U.S. minister to the Court of St. James . The building in which he lived still stands in the square 's northeast corner . The embassy moved to various locations in the West End before returning to Grosvenor Square in 1938 . For years , it occupied a building on the east side of the square -- a building that now houses the Canadian High Commission . During World War II , the square was known as `` Little America '' because the embassy was on one side and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 's headquarters were on the other . The embassy moved to its current site , occupying the entire west side of the square , when the building was completed in 1960 . The concrete , four-story structure was designed by Eero Saarinen , who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis , Missouri , and the U.S. Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs , Colorado . Since the September 11 attacks in 2001 , the embassy has caused controversy locally by installing blast walls in a wide perimeter around the building . Neighbors complained the walls were unsightly , and the walls caused the road in front of the building to be closed to traffic . Sitting atop the building at the front is a huge gilded aluminum eagle with a 35-foot wingspan . It is not clear whether the eagle will be considered part of the building 's listed status , meaning it will have to stay on the facade , or whether it can be moved to the new location , according to a spokesman for the realty firm Cushman and Wakefield , which advised the United States on the sale .","question":""}

Attorney General Eric Holder announced the wrap-up of Project Coronado , which resulted in arrests in 15 states in the past two days . Holder said the operation targeted the distribution network of a major Mexican drug trafficking organization known as La Familia . About 3,000 federal agents participated in the investigation and raids , officials said . `` This unprecedented , coordinated U.S. law enforcement action -- the largest ever undertaken against a Mexican drug cartel -- has dealt a significant blow to La Familia 's supply chain of illegal drugs , weapons and cash flowing between Mexico and the United States , '' Holder said in a news conference . Watch Holder announce the arrests '' Michele Leonhart , acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration , said the cartel was known for specializing in the trafficking of methamphetamine and for its brutal violence , including beheadings . Authorities said the arrests made Wednesday and Thursday occurred in California , Colorado , Georgia , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , Nevada , New York , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas and Washington . Dozens of arrests occurred in the Dallas , Texas , area where agents with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives filed charges against cartel members believed to have illegally purchased and shipped high-powered firearms to the cartel , which was based in the Mexican state of Michoacan . U.S. officials vowed to indict cartel leaders and extradite them to the United States . One leader , Servando Gomez-Martinez , was indicted in New York on Thursday . He remains at large , and is presumed to be in Mexico . A senior law enforcement official involved in the operation , who asked not to be identified , said he was certain the latest crackdown on La Familia would affect the methamphetamine market in the United States for months . `` It 'll make a difference not only because of how hard we hit 'em , but where we hit 'em , '' the official said . Another official said during the course of the investigation that labs run by La Familia had been discovered in Atlanta , Georgia , and San Jose , California . To date , Project Coronado has led to 1,186 arrests in 44 months . During that time , agents seized $ 32.8 million in U.S. currency , and about 1,225 kilograms -LRB- 2,700 pounds -RRB- of methamphetamine , 2,000 kilograms -LRB- 4,409 pounds -RRB- of cocaine , 13 kilograms -LRB- 29 pounds -RRB- of heroin and more than 8 tons -LRB- 7,200 kilograms -RRB- of marijuana .","question":""}
{"answer":"Paris , France -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana , whose assassination sparked the 1994 genocide , was arrested Tuesday in Paris on a Rwandan warrant , French and Rwandan officials said . Agathe Habyarimana was arrested at her French home Tuesday morning and is scheduled to appear in court later in the day , said a deputy prosecutor who declined to give his name because he is not authorized to speak about the matter . Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo told CNN that Habyarimana was arrested on genocide charges . They include genocide , conspiracy to commit genocide , complicity to commit genocide , and direct and public incitement to commit genocide , said John Bosco Mutangana , the head of Rwanda 's Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit . The charges also cover crimes against humanity , specifically murder and extermination ; creation of a criminal gang , namely the Hutu militias ; and aiding and abetting the killings perpetrated by soldiers in violation of the Geneva Convention , Mutangana told CNN . `` We have of course strong evidence linking her to the genocide and the planning of the genocide itself , as early as the early 1990s , '' Mutangana said . Former president was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot down near the capital , Kigali . The mass killings began hours later , and by the time they ended 100 days later , some 800,000 people had been killed . Most were members of the country 's Tutsi minority , killed by members of the Hutu majority . The circumstances surrounding Habyarimana 's death remain a mystery . He was a Hutu , and speculation immediately fell on Tutsis as the perpetrators of the attack -- but some have also speculated that Hutus themselves shot down the plane to provide cover for the genocide . Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide have been tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal , which is based in Tanzania . Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried by local communities in `` gacaca '' courts , which allow survivors to confront their attackers . Some human rights organizations have criticized the gacaca courts for falling short on delivering justice . Agathe Habyarimana is now under temporary arrest , the French deputy prosecutor said . The Court of Appeal in Paris must now decide whether to remand her into custody or place her under judicial control at her home , he said . After that , the French court must decide on the validity of the Rwandan warrant before any decision on extradition can be made , the deputy prosecutor said . Rwandan officials began working on Agathe Habyarimana 's case in 1995 , but it took a while before they could gather enough evidence to indict her , Mutangana said . They submitted the indictment last October , he said . Mutangana said Rwanda is hoping France will extradite her . `` We are the first beneficiaries of justice , the Rwandans , '' he said .

{"answer":"White Plains , New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik on Thursday pleaded guilty to charges of lying to Bush administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination to be homeland security secretary . Kerik admitted to eight counts as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors , who are recommending a 27 - to 33-month prison term . U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson set Kerik 's sentencing for February 18 . In court papers , prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was `` any possible concern '' about his relationships with the contractors involved in renovations to his apartment or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors . Kerik , 54 , had been scheduled to go to trial next week on a variety of corruption charges , including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York . He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts during Thursday morning 's hearing . Robinson said he would take into account Kerik 's life and career , which he said `` included good '' as well as wrongdoing . Kerik put his head in his hands at that point . Kerik has spent the past two weeks in jail after a judge revoked his bail . According to court papers released in late October , he violated the terms of his bail by leaking confidential evidence about his case to a lawyer who published the material online . Kerik served as New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 -- a tenure that included the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people .

In 2006 , Kerik pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts while he worked as city corrections commissioner , but under a plea agreement he paid $ 221,000 in fines and avoided jail time . His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who said his endorsement of Kerik had been `` a mistake .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly two years into the recession , opinion about which political party is responsible for the severe economic downturn is shifting , according to a new national poll . A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday morning indicates that 38 percent of the public blames Republicans for the country 's current economic problems . In May , 53 percent blamed the GOP . According to the poll , 27 percent now blame the Democrats for the recession , up 6 points from May , and 27 percent now say both parties are responsible . `` The bad news for the Democrats is that the number of Americans who hold the GOP exclusively responsible for the recession has been steadily falling by about two to three points per month , '' said Keating Holland , CNN polling director . `` At that rate , only a handful of voters will blame the economy on the Republicans by the time next year 's midterm elections roll around . . '' Thirty-six percent of people questioned said that President Obama 's policies have improved economic conditions , with 28 percent feeling that the president 's programs have made things worse , and 35 percent saying what he 's done has had no effect on the economy . One reason for that , Holland said , may be the growing federal budget deficit : Two-thirds say that the government should balance the budget even in a time of war and recession . The survey indicates that only 18 percent said the economic conditions in the country today are good , down 3 points from August . Eighty-two percent said economic conditions are poor . `` Some economic indicators may suggest that the economy has turned the corner -- but try telling that to the American people , '' Holland said .

In addition , he is charged with conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses . `` Ghailani is further charged with providing material support to terrorism . This charge alleges that after the bombing , Ghailani continued in his service to al Qaeda as a document forger , physical trainer at an al Qaeda training camp , and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , left , greets Iraq 's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday . `` Iraq today does n't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime , '' al-Maliki told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a Sunday meeting between two leaders , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office . `` Today 's Iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law , and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect , '' al-Maliki said . Earlier , Iran 's state-run news agency IRNA quoted the Iraqi leader as saying that `` Baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries , including Iran . '' His remarks come as the United States and Iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the U.S. military will remain in Iraq and what role it will play in Iraq 's security . But al-Maliki media adviser Ali Hadi said negotiations between Iraq and the United States are in their `` very early stages '' and were not part of Sunday 's talks . Watch Ahmadinejad and al-Maliki sit down for talks '' `` The treaty is purely an Iraqi-American treaty . The Iranians have nothing to do with it , '' Hadi said . `` We will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an Iraqi issue . '' The proposed U.S.-Iraqi pact has triggered street protests in Iraq , where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent American bases , a long-term presence of U.S. troops and a weakening of Iraqi government control over those troops . Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , whose militia was the target of a U.S.-backed Iraqi clampdown in Basra and Baghdad recently , has called for weekly protests against the agreement . Al-Maliki and Ahmadinejad met Sunday afternoon , with Ahmadinejad calling on Iraq 's neighbors and the United Nations to help restore security and stability to Iraq , IRNA reported . And al-Maliki thanked Ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding U.N. sanctions against Iraq that date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf war . Iran has long called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , which the United States invaded in 2003 . Meanwhile , the United States has accused Iran of arming and training `` criminal '' Shiite militias in Iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , allegations the Iranians deny . It is al-Maliki 's third visit to Iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago . The two countries , which are neighbors , both have Shiite Muslim majorities , and al-Maliki 's ruling coalition is dominated by Shiite religious parties long backed by Iran . Adnan Pachachi , a leading Sunni Arab member of Iraq 's parliament , told CNN he wanted al-Maliki to call on Iran to stop supporting armed factions in Iraq . `` I think this has to stop , '' Pachachi told CNN . `` I hope that Mr. Maliki will make it absolutely clear that Iraqis of all parties , of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins , are strongly opposed to Iran 's attempt to interfere in Iraq 's affairs . '' Pachachi , a former foreign minister , said al-Maliki 's predecessor , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , allowed Iraq 's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias , and that U.S. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out . `` In the long run , it is in the interest of the United States to have a secure Iraq and armed forces and security forces of Iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties , '' he said .","question":""}

The president first mentioned the program in his State of the Union speech Wednesday night . The administration initially released an outline for a national high-speed rail network last April . Each of the corridors identified by the administration last year are between 100 and 600 miles long . The program is `` a long-term venture in which states will need to plan projects , purchase and lay track , build and assemble equipment , and construct or upgrade train stations , tunnels and bridges , '' the statement said . In addition to the $ 8 billion mentioned by Obama , the plan also includes $ 1 billion a year for five years in the federal budget `` as a down payment to jump-start the program , '' the White House said . Train corridors in the program include : -- San Diego-Los Angeles-San Luis Obispo in California -- Oakland-Sacramento in California -- Portland-Eugene in Oregon -- Seattle-Portland in Washington and Oregon -- Chicago-St .

{"answer":"JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pope Benedict XVI will not visit Israel 's Holocaust museum when he makes his first trip to the region as pope in May , though he will visit a memorial that is part of the site , his ambassador to Israel said Tuesday . Pope Benedict XVI , shown at the Vatican during a prayer Sunday , has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust . He will also become the first pontiff to visit the Dome of the Rock , one of the holiest sites in Islam , said the envoy , papal nuncio Antonio Franco . Foreign heads of state normally visit the Holocaust museum , which is part of the Yad Vashem complex in Jerusalem . But it includes controversial wording describing the role of Pope Pius XII during World War II , which is why Pope Benedict balked , an Israeli official said . Critics have accused Pope Pius of doing too little to prevent the mass murder of European Jews by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler . A caption in the museum says he maintained a neutral position during the years of mass extermination of Europe 's Jews . The Vatican defends him and is gradually opening its archives in an effort to show that he acted behind the scenes . Franco gave the news of Pope Benedict 's visit to Yad Vashem at a news conference in Jerusalem . Pope John Paul II also did not visit the museum section on his historic pilgrimage to Israel in 2000 , Father Federico Lombardi , a papal spokesman , said as he confirmed that Pope Benedict will not do so . An official with Israel 's Foreign Ministry said the decision was made jointly because of the sensitivity of the matter . Yigal Palmor conceded that there is an argument over the wartime pope 's actions during the Holocaust and noted that the museum has a sign stating that the facts are in dispute . He said that Pope Benedict may visit other parts of the Yad Vashem complex , which is divided into several compounds , and that the pontiff will lay a wreath at the site 's Hall of Remembrance , which is part of the protocol for visiting heads of state . The announcement that Pope Benedict will visit only part of Yad Vashem also follows international outrage over his rehabilitation of a rebel bishop who denied the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust . The Vatican ordered the bishop , Richard Williamson , to recant , and said the pope was not aware of Williamson 's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication of the bishop . Pope Benedict , who was born in Germany and forced to join the Hitler Youth as a teenager , has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust on a number of occasions , including on a visit to the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Pope Benedict will make his pilgrimage to the Holy Land May 8-15 with stops in Amman , Jerusalem , Bethlehem and Nazareth , according to the itinerary released by the Vatican . He will be celebrating Mass in Jerusalem , Bethlehem and Nazareth , the city where Christians believe Jesus preached and lived . Some 50,000 pilgrims are expected to attend that event , the bishop of Nazareth said . In Jerusalem , a city holy to all three of the major monotheistic faiths , Pope Benedict will visit the Western Wall , Judaism 's holiest prayer site , and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , which Catholics believe is the site of the crucifixion , burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ . The pope will also meet Israel 's chief rabbis and enter the Dome of the Rock with the chief Muslim cleric in the Holy Land , the grand mufti of Jerusalem . He will also meet Jordan 's King Abdullah and Israeli President Shimon Peres , as well as Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority , Franco said . CNN 's Guy Azriel in Jerusalem and Alessandro Gentile in Rome contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Mexico City , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities believe assassins targeted a pregnant woman and two other people connected with a U.S. consulate who were killed in drive-by shootings over the weekend , Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Monday . The killings were carried out by a local gang , known as Los Aztecas , that is allied with the Juarez Cartel , Reyes told CNN . No arrests had been made by Monday afternoon . `` We know that the U.S. citizens were targeted , '' Reyes told CNN , saying a police officer saw gunfire from a car directed at the Americans ' car . `` We know they were chasing them . We know they wanted to kill them . '' Two of the victims were a four-months-pregnant employee of the consulate in Juarez and her U.S. citizen husband who was a jailer in nearby El Paso , Texas , U.S. and Mexican officials said . The couple 's 10-month-old child , who was in the vehicle , was not injured , Reyes and other officials said . The child has been turned over to U.S. consular officials , Reyes said . The couple lived in El Paso , the State Department said . The third victim , found dead in a separate vehicle , was identified as the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate . His wife was not traveling with him , but two of their children in the car were wounded , officials said . All the victims had left a birthday party at the consulate Saturday before they were attacked , Reyes and State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday . The slain couple , Arthur Redelfs , 34 , and Lesley Ann Enriquez , 35 , were on their way home to El Paso , Crowley said . Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the El Paso County Sheriff 's Office , according to Jesse Tovar , a spokesman for the department . Reyes said the attackers may have been confused because both groups of victims were traveling in similar-looking vehicles . Redelfs and his wife were in a white late-model Toyota RAV4 SUV . The third victim , Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros , was driving a late-model white Honda Pilot , the mayor said . Salcido , 37 , was a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. consulate , Reyes said . His two children , ages 4 and 7 , were wounded and transported to a hospital , the attorney general 's office said . Salcido 's wife was traveling in another vehicle , which was not attacked , Reyes said . In Washington , President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their anger . `` The president is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of three people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez , '' National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement Sunday . `` He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions . In concert with Mexican authorities , we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice . '' Clinton said the `` safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts around the world is always our highest priority . '' `` I have spoken with our ambassador in Mexico , and we are working with the government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of these horrendous acts are brought to justice , '' she said . In response to the shootings , the U.S. State Department authorized the temporary relocation of employees ' families working in border-area consulates . `` These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are , sadly , part of a growing tragedy besetting many communities in Mexico , '' Clinton said in a statement Sunday night . `` They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the Government of -LSB- Mexican -RSB- President -LSB- Felipe -RSB- Calderon to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico . '' The families of employees at U.S. consulates in Tijuana , Nogales , Ciudad Juarez , Nuevo Laredo , Monterrey and Matamoros are allowed to leave for 30 days `` in response to an increase in violence along the Mexican side of its border with the U.S. , '' State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN . The authorization can be renewed after 30 days , depending on a review , Lash said , adding that this was not a mandatory evacuation . The announcement was part of a warning to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Mexico . The warning urges U.S. citizens to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango , Coahuila and Chihuahua , where Juarez is located , because of `` recent violent attacks . '' U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of these three states . Attacks include the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua , the warning states . `` Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , '' the warning says . `` During some of these incidents , U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area . '' Reyes , who received a death threat last week , said the shootings highlight a problem shared by both countries along their 2,000-mile border . `` It is not just a Mexican problem -- it 's is a U.S.-Mexico problem , '' Reyes said . `` I 'm very glad that the U.S. has taken that position . '' He said that he supported the State Department 's authorization to consular families and that `` it is important they feel safe . '' Mexico said Sunday that it was committed to protecting all people , citizens and visitors alike , diplomats or not . `` The Mexican government deeply laments the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez , '' Mexico 's foreign ministry said in a statement . `` The Mexican authorities are working with determination to clear up the facts surrounding the crime scene and put those responsible before the law . '' Juarez is one of the front lines in Mexico 's war against the drug cartels that operate in its territory . More than 2,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2009 . The city has become a focal point of Calderon 's anti-drug efforts after the January 31 killings of 15 people there , most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime . The incident sparked outrage across Mexico . But the violence is not restricted to Juarez . In the western state of Guerrero , at least 25 people were killed Saturday , state officials said . The bodies of 14 people , including nine civilians and five police officers , were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco , the official Notimex news agency reported , citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas . In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso , 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to execute search warrants at two locations , Salinas said . Police in the state were on a heightened security alert , he said . The government has not released official figures , but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009 . Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008 . Unofficial tallies this year say more than 16,000 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the cartels after assuming office in December 2006 .

The English Premier League side needed a victory to guarantee their place in the knockout stage and they got the perfect start when Drogba scored in the third minute -- Chelsea 's fastest ever Champions League goal . Midfielder Ramires doubled their advantage midway through the half after capitalizing on some hesitant Valencia defending . Real Madrid to topple Barcelona in ` El Clasico ' clash ? And Drogba sealed the victory 14 minutes from time when sliding the ball home from Juan Mata 's slide-rule pass . The result also means Chelsea top the group with 11 points after Bayer Leverkusen -- who had already qualified -- were held to a 1-1 draw by Genk in Belgium . Jelle Vossen put the home side ahead in the first half with a superb volley , but Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok leveled for the Bundesliga side 11 minutes from time . Leverkusen go through as group runners-up on 10 points , with third-placed Valencia going into the Europa League and Genk eliminated from Europe . There was late drama in Group F , where Marseille came back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Dortmund , a result that saw them go through to the last 16 in second place behind already-qualified Arsenal . Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski put the home side ahead from close range in the 23rd minute and Mats Hummels doubled Dortmund 's advantage nine minutes later from the penalty spot , after captain Sebastian Kehl received a nasty kick in the face from defender Stephane Mbia . But Marseille gave themselves hope on the stroke of half-time when Loic Remy headed home Morgan Amalfitano 's right-wing cross . The score stayed that way until five minutes from the end when Andre Ayew powerfully headed home Amalfitano 's corner . And a sensational comeback was completed just two minutes later when substitute Mathieu Valbuena skipped past a couple of challenges before curling home a delightful winner . Marseille 's victory was bad news for Olympiakos , who beat a depleted Arsenal side 3-1 in Piraeus .

{"answer":"Naoma , West Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- West Virginia 's governor on Tuesday named a former head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to lead a state investigation into last week 's coal mine explosion that left 29 miners dead . Davitt McAteer has overseen investigations into two previous mine accidents , the Sago disaster that killed 12 miners in 2006 and the fire at the Aracoma Alma No. 2 mine that left two workers dead . The West Virginia native served as the Clinton administration 's assistant labor secretary for mine safety in the 1990s and is vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University . `` Davitt has the experience and knowledge to lead what will be a complex and extensive investigation into this horrible accident , '' Gov. Joe Manchin said in announcing McAteer 's appointment . `` We made tremendous progress in 2006 immediately following the Sago and Aracoma accidents , and I fully expect that we will learn even more from this and make dramatic changes to protect our miners . '' The last bodies were recovered early Tuesday from the Upper Big Branch mine , the scene of the fatal explosion April 5 . McAteer was critical of the mine 's owner , Virginia-based Massey Energy , in the days after the blast . `` Some companies , and this appears to be one , take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it 's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people 's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes , comply with the laws , '' McAteer said last week . There was no immediate response from Massey Energy to McAteer 's appointment , but Massey CEO Don Blankenship said last week that its safety history is among the best in the industry . The Montcoal , West Virginia , mine received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009 , and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected , according to federal mine safety records . Inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010 , including six times for `` unwarrantable failure '' to correct violations . Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges and paid a record $ 4.2 million in fines and civil penalties in connection with the January 2006 fire that McAteer investigated . Manchin said the state owes an explanation for last week 's disaster to the families of the men who died in the Upper Big Branch mine , `` And we owe it to them and every coal miner working today to do everything humanly possible to prevent this from happening again . '' Managers of two pension funds have called on Massey 's board to oust Blankenship , who has been critical of mining regulations in the past . `` Massey 's cavalier attitude toward risk and callous disregard for the safety of its employees has exacted a horrible cost on dozens of hard-working miners and their loved ones , '' New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a written statement Monday . He said Blankenship `` must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at Massey . '' New York 's state pension fund , which DiNapoli manages , has about $ 14 million worth of Massey stock -- a tiny fraction of the company 's estimated $ 4.3 billion market capitalization . But his call was echoed by the CtW Investment Group , which manages pension funds for about 6 million union workers . CtW blamed Blankenship 's `` confrontational approach to regulatory compliance '' and the failure of the company 's board of directors to challenge him for the disaster . `` Under Chairman and CEO Blankenship 's domineering leadership , Massey Energy placed short-term production and profit goals ahead of prudent risk management , with devastating consequences for the corporation , its shareholders and employees , '' the fund wrote in a letter to the board . `` In light of these consequences , the urgent need for new leadership is apparent . '' The company has not commented on calls for Blankeship 's ouster , but said safety `` has been and will continue to be our top priority every day . '' `` We do not condone any violation of Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations , and we strive to be in compliance with all regulations at all times , '' it said in a written statement last week . Bodies of the remaining victims were removed overnight , said Jama Jarrett , spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners ' Health , Safety and Training . The bodies of seven victims had been recovered shortly after the explosion , and 13 bodies were removed Sunday . Until Sunday , U.S. flags on all federal buildings in the state will be kept at half-staff per a proclamation that President Obama signed on Monday . The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972 , when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg , Idaho .

{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States . COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often , but not always , caused by smoking . While the risk reduction is relatively small , 10 percent , COPD is a common and life-threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed . COPD symptoms include shortness of breath , coughing , and fatigue . `` The effect appears to be modest . But for something for which there is n't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition , anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit , '' says Jeffrey B. Blumberg , Ph.D. , a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Boston who was not involved in the study . The research , from the government-funded Women 's Health Study , included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of COPD before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo , vitamin E supplements -LRB- 600 IU every other day -RRB- or aspirin -LRB- 100 mg per day -RRB- , either alone or in combination . At the end of 10 years , 760 of the 19,937 women who took vitamin E alone or with aspirin developed COPD compared with 846 of the 19,939 who took a placebo or aspirin alone -- a 10 percent risk reduction . Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma , a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD . Health.com : 10 ways to have cleaner air at home The researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age , which can affect COPD risk . The study , conducted by Cornell University and Brigham and Women 's Hospital researchers , is to be presented this week at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans . The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is `` biologically plausible , '' says Yvonne Kelly , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London . Experts believe vitamins A , C , and E -- the so-called ACE antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD . Health.com : Eight causes of a chronic cough Several studies have shown that these vitamins , as well as vitamin D , may help improve lung health . In a 2003 study , Kelly and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins C and E had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm , respectively . Phlegm production and wheezing are also COPD symptoms . One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD , says Michael Sims , M.D. , an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center . He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD , or vice versa , since the symptoms are similar . In addition , early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that do n't turn out to be COPD . Health.com : How to buy the right air cleaner In future studies , Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry . `` If you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome -LSB- like spirometry -RSB- , among smokers and nonsmokers , that you could affect the incidence of COPD , I would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake -LSB- of vitamin E -RSB- for the general population , '' he says . Currently , no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD . The best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking , says Dr. Sims . About 24 million people in the U.S. have COPD -- 12 million who 've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have COPD but do n't know they have it . In the study , women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop COPD . Health.com :12 best COPD blogs and Web sites The daily recommended intake of vitamin E is about 22 international units for those 14 and older , and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower , almonds , peanut butter , and spinach . The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher , at 300 IU per day . However , Blumberg says this is within the range of most over-the-counter vitamin supplements , which deliver 100 or 400 IU daily . `` This study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found , '' he says . Vitamin E intake is generally a concern only at very high doses , above 1500 IU per day . Several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting . For this reason , high doses of vitamin E are not recommended for people taking blood-thinners such as warfarin -LRB- Coumadin -RRB- and aspirin . Health.com : Eight breathing tips for people with COPD For people concerned about their lung health , taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea , says Blumberg . `` If I were talking to somebody who was a former smoker and who was concerned about minimizing their risk of not only lung disease but also heart disease and cancer , then taking a supplement of C and E would be a reasonable thing to do , '' he says . In fact , anyone who thought he or she was at increased risk of COPD could potentially benefit from these supplements , he adds . Supplements of beta-carotene , which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin A , should be used with caution , however . While a 2006 French study found that people with diets high in beta-carotene had a slower decline in lung function over an eight-year period , heavy smokers and drinkers may not benefit . Two studies found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily . According to Sims , the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD . `` If it could be done with something like vitamin E , that 's a relatively low-risk intervention , that would be the Holy Grail .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an important milestone Wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid : For the first time in eight months , her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's campaign committee reported owing $ 2.3 million in debt at the end of March . On a day most Americans were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes , Clinton 's campaign committee filed finance documents with the Federal Election Commission , reporting a total of $ 2.3 million in debts at the end of March , compared with $ 2.6 million in the bank . The nation 's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her White House bid in June 2008 , when her debt peaked at $ 25.2 million . That amount covered $ 12 million owed to vendors , as well as the $ 13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds . Clinton 's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the Democratic National Convention convened in Denver , Colorado , last August , the deadline mandated by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law . The former New York senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount . Her campaign owed $ 6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of November ; $ 5.9 million to five creditors at the end of December ; and the current $ 2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of March . That creditor is Penn , Schoen & Berland , a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid . The firm 's president , Mark Penn , was Clinton 's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last April amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of Colombia for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal that Clinton opposed . Penn remained involved with the campaign . Earlier this year , Clinton and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation 's 67th secretary of state on January 21 . As of that date , Clinton became subject to a federal law known as the Hatch Act , which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions . The Hatch Act allows others to keep raising money on Clinton 's behalf , without her direct involvement . This week , longtime Clinton ally James Carville , a CNN contributor , sent a fundraising e-mail to Democrats on behalf of Clinton 's campaign , requesting contributions of as little as $ 5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes , including spending a day with former President Bill Clinton . `` I wo n't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary , '' Carville e-mailed . `` I know what she means to you , and I 'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations . '' It 's unclear whether the campaign will use the $ 2.6 million in the bank to clear its $ 2.3 million in debts in the short term . Continued fundraising indicates that it will not . Additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge . Any extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors . Clinton 's campaign reported raising $ 938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009 . In addition to tapping traditional fundraising , the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations . It received $ 2.6 million from Clinton 's `` Friends of Hillary '' U.S. Senate campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $ 2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters . Organizations that have rented Clinton 's lists include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , the inaugural committee of then-President-elect Barack Obama , and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation . Those organizations each paid $ 274,297 . Clinton 's political action committee , HillPAC , rented the lists for $ 822,492 . Among the Democratic candidates who have rented Clinton 's campaign lists are Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln ; Virginia gubernatorial candidate and former Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe ; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who was appointed to fill Clinton 's seat ; and New York congressional candidate Scott Murphy , who hopes to succeed Gillibrand in the U.S. House .","question":""}
{"answer":"JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.N. team entered Gaza on Monday to investigate possible human rights abuses by Israel and Hamas during a three-week conflict that ended January 18 . Palestinians run from an Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school in northern Gaza on January 17 . Richard Goldstone , a former Rwanda and Yugoslavia war crimes prosecutor , is leading the Human Rights Council investigation of the conflict that claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Palestinians and 13 Israelis . Goldstone and three other investigators entered Gaza via Egypt for a five-day visit . Upon crossing into the Palestinian territory , Goldstone told reporters , `` We 've come here to see . We 've come here to learn . We 've come here to talk to people in all walks of life , ordinary people , governmental people , administrative people , obviously nongovernmental organizations that are so important in this sort of situation . '' The Geneva , Switzerland-based Human Rights Council established the fact-finding mission April 3 `` to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 , whether before , during or after . '' Israel launched its offensive in Gaza with the stated intent of stopping a barrage of rockets -- primarily short-range homemade Qassam rockets -- fired from the territory into southern Israel by Hamas fighters . The Israeli government is not assisting the investigators , who are not scheduled to visit Israel as part of the inquiry . Yigal Palmor , a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry , said that `` there is not a chance we will cooperate with this mission '' under the terms of the Human Rights Council mandate . `` The resolution was adopted by a vote of non-Democratic countries , and the democratic countries either abstained or rejected the resolution , '' Palmor said . Israel has been long been a critic of the Human Rights Council , arguing that it is one-sided in its approach to the Jewish state . The Israeli military conducted an investigation of its actions in the Gaza conflict and concluded in a report released in April that it `` operated in accordance with international law . '' An Israeli human rights group called that conclusion problematic since an impartial external body did not lead the investigation . The Palestinian Center for Human Rights has said that 1,417 Palestinians were killed in the fighting , of which 236 were active combatants . The Israeli military put the death toll at 1,166 and has maintained that more than half were `` Hamas terror operatives '' The Hamas movement welcomed the arrival of the investigators . Fawzi Barhoum , a Hamas spokesman , said , `` We are ready to help these committees and encourage them to unveil the truth and bring out all the hidden details of what took place during the war , hoping to show the entire world the truth . '' Barhoum went on to say that Israel 's lack of cooperation was evidence that it was trying to cover up crimes committed in Gaza . The U.S. State Department has labeled Hamas , a Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist organization , a terrorist group . Its military wing , Izzedine al Qassam , has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as well as attacks against the Israeli military .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Deaths from pregnancy and childbirth in the United States have doubled in the past 20 years , a development that a human rights group called `` scandalous and disgraceful '' Friday . In addition , the rights group said , about 1.7 million women a year , one-third of pregnant women in the United States , suffer from pregnancy-related complications . Most of the deaths and complications occur among minorities and women living in poverty , it noted . Amnesty International issued a report Friday that calls on President Obama to take action . `` This country 's extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful , '' said Larry Cox , executive director of Amnesty International USA . `` Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors . Women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies , '' Cox said in a news release . The report , `` Deadly Delivery : The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA , '' notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the United States than in 40 other countries , including virtually all industrialized nations . The report also noted that severe pregnancy-related complications that nearly cause death -- known as `` near misses '' -- have increased by 25 percent since 1998 . Up to 40 percent of near misses are considered preventable with better quality of care , according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology . Minorities , women living in poverty , Native Americans , immigrants and those who speak little or no English are particularly affected , Amnesty International said . `` The thing that really struck us was that these problems hit women of color , low-income , particularly hard , '' said Nan Strauss , researcher and co-author of the Amnesty report . `` But every woman who is going through pregnancy in this country is at risk . '' Figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , show that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts . White women have a mortality rate of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies , the CDC said . For African-American women , that rate is 32.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies . `` This has been known for a while and no one has a good handle on it , '' said Dr. Elliot Main , chairman and chief of obstetrics at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco . `` This is a national disgrace and a call to action . Both numbers are a call to action -- maternal mortality and racial disparity . '' The CDC analysis shows that deaths during pregnancy and childbirth have doubled for all U.S. women in the past 20 years . In 1987 , there were 6.6 deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies . The number of deaths had climbed to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006 , the last year for which figures were available . A report called `` Healthy People 2010 '' by the Department of Health and Human Services says that number should be around four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies . Statistics for other highly industrialized countries show that the U.S. goal of four deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies is attainable . Great Britain , for example , has fewer than four deaths for each 100,000 pregnancies , Main said . `` Women 's health is at risk , '' said Strauss . `` We spend the most , and yet women are more likely to die than in 40 other countries . And that disconnect is what makes it such a problem . '' Amnesty International points out that nearly 13 million U.S. women of reproductive age -LRB- 15 to 44 years old -RRB- , or one in five , do not have health insurance . Minorities account for 32 percent of all women in the United States but 51 percent of uninsured women , the rights group said . Furthermore , Amnesty International said , one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care , starting in the first trimester . The number rises to about one in three for African-American and Native American women , the human rights group said . Amnesty International also cited what it called `` burdensome bureaucratic procedures in Medicaid enrollment -LSB- that -RSB- substantially delay access to vital prenatal care for pregnant women seeking government-funded care . '' In addition , the group said , a shortage of health care professionals poses a serious obstacle to timely and adequate care , especially in rural areas and inner cities . In 2008 , 64 million people were living in `` shortage areas '' for primary care , Amnesty International said . `` Obstacles to care are widespread , even though the USA spends more on health care than any other country and more on pregnancy and childbirth-related hospital costs , $ 86 billion , than any other type of hospital care , '' the rights group said . In its call for Obama to take action , Amnesty International said a health care reform proposal before Congress does not address the issue . `` Reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs , and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care , '' said Rachel Ward , one of the authors of the `` Deadly Delivery '' report . `` Mothers die not because the United States ca n't provide good care , but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women , '' said Cox , Amnesty International USA 's executive director . Medical professionals and researchers note that although the percentage of maternal deaths is increasing , the overall number still remains low . `` They are low in absolute number sense , '' said Main in San Francisco . `` These are rare events . They serve as a canary in the mine shaft -- tell us that we need to look more carefully at the system of maternity care . Overall , childbirth is very safe . '' More of an alarm is not sounded , analysts said , because most practitioners do n't see many -- if any -- deaths each year . There is now approximately one death for every 6,000 to 10,000 births , Main said . A typical hospital has about 1,500 births a year , so any hospital can go years without a maternal death , he said . `` It 's still , thank heavens , quite rare , '' said Debra Bingham , executive director of California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative . But that does n't mean there 's not a problem , she said . `` When you see trends worsen in such a short period of time , it requires thoughtful examination , '' said Bingham . `` And you ca n't just dismiss that . '' Rivka Gordon , director of strategic initiatives at the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals , also believes something should be done . `` It 's unacceptable in a resource-rich country like the U.S. that we are seeing maternal - and pregnancy-related deaths trending upward , '' she said . `` We have to look very , very carefully at this .

{"answer":"BANGKOK , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Thai court has found deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra guilty of corruption , and sentenced him in absentia to two years imprisonment . Thaksin Shinawatra lives in self-imposed exile in London . The case stemmed from a Bangkok land deal while Thaksin was in office . He was convicted of violating a law that bans ministers or their wives from conducting business with government agencies . Thaksin , who now lives in the United Kingdom , is unlikely to serve any jail time . He fled from Thailand in August just as he was to appear in court . In the land deal , Thaksin 's wife , Pojama , is accused of using her husband 's political influence to buy undeveloped land from a government agency for about a third of its estimated value . Watch more about the verdict '' The case is one of several corruption cases against Thaksin and his family that are winding their way through the legal system . The billionaire is accused of abusing the country 's system of checks and balances and bending government policy to benefit his family 's business . Thaksin has consistently denied that he or his family was involved in any wrongdoing . In August , Thaksin and his wife skipped a court appearance and fled to the United Kingdom rather than testify in the real-estate case . He said he did so because he did not think he would get a fair trial in Thailand . Thaksin , a telecommunications tycoon , once owned the English Premier League Manchester City Football Club but sold his stake this year . His party won two landslide victories before he was deposed in a bloodless military coup in September 2006 after massive anti-government street protests . He returned to Thailand after his allies in the People Power Party won nearly half the seats in the lower house in December 's parliamentary elections and formed the ruling coalition . In recent weeks , the country has seen daily demonstrations from anti-government protesters who want PPP leaders purged from the Cabinet . They have laid siege to the Government House -- the seat of the Thai government -- since August 26 . The protesters -- led by the People 's Alliance for Democracy -- contend that the PPP is trying to amend the constitution so Thaksin does not have to face charges . In September , Thailand 's Constitutional Court stripped then-Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej of his position , ruling that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show . The PPP responded by picking Thaksin 's brother-in-law as Samak 's replacement -- further inflaming the protesters . CNN 's Dan Rivers contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida man in custody in Haiti faces first-degree murder charges in the deaths of his wife and five children , authorities said Tuesday . Police have obtained a warrant to arrest Mesac Damas , 33 , on suspicion of six counts of first-degree murder . Police obtained a warrant overnight to arrest Mesac Damas , 33 , on suspicion of six counts of first-degree murder , the Collier County , Florida , Sheriff 's Office said in a statement . `` This warrant was obtained based on information and evidence collected thus far in the investigation and statements made by Damas to a federal agent after his detention in Haiti , '' the statement said . The body of Damas ' wife , Guerline Damas , 32 , was found Saturday in the family 's North Naples , Florida , home , along with those of the couple 's five children -- Michzach , 9 ; Marven , 6 ; Maven , 5 ; Megan , 3 ; and Morgan , 11 months , police said . Authorities have not said how the five were killed , but Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk described the scene as `` horrific . '' Police released few new details in the case at a Tuesday news conference , except to say they think the killings were premeditated . They added that under the law , `` premeditated '' does not necessarily mean a crime was planned far in advance . Damas was last seen about 9 p.m. Thursday at the Naples restaurant where he was employed as a cook , authorities said . On Friday , he is thought to have arrived at Miami International Airport about 7 a.m. . He boarded a flight for Haiti about 10 a.m. , Rambosk said . His car was found at the airport . He purchased a one-way ticket to Haiti , police said Tuesday . Police had asked the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for help in finding Damas . The FBI 's legal attach\u00e9 in the Dominican Republic notified Collier County authorities that a man believed to be Damas was taken into custody Monday by the Haitian National Police . `` Information obtained by CCSO shows Damas was found hiding near a hotel in the capital city of Port-au-Prince , '' a sheriff 's statement said Tuesday . The judge who signed the warrant ordered that Damas be held without bond upon his return to Collier County , authorities said . If convicted of six counts of first-degree murder , Damas could face life in prison or the death penalty . Collier County investigators are traveling to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to interview Damas , the statement said . Rambosk said authorities are looking into two options to return Damas to Florida : following the normal extradition process , or having him deported from Haiti , since he is a U.S. citizen . Mesac and Guerline Damas had a history of domestic violence , police said . Mesac Damas was arrested in January , and pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges against his wife in June . Police said they did not believe he served any jail time , and did not think a restraining order was currently in place regarding the couple . However , an arrest warrant was issued Monday for Damas on charges of violating probation stemming from the January arrest . The Damases had been married about 10 years , Rambosk said . He did not know how long they had lived in Naples . The six bodies were found about 6:30 p.m. Saturday , a day after police had visited the home to check on the family , Collier County sheriff 's Capt. Chris Roberts said . A family member asked police to conduct a welfare check on the home Friday , saying a resident there had not been heard from , Roberts said . Responding officers knocked on the door and got no answer , he said , but they saw nothing that aroused their suspicions . The following morning , the family member became more concerned and filed a missing persons report , Rambosk said . Later , authorities requested a key to the house from property management , as well as authorization to enter . Rambosk said Tuesday the victims ' family members are `` extremely emotional and distraught . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic intends to skip the start of his war crimes trial because he says he has had too little time to prepare , a spokeswoman for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said Thursday . Radovan Karadzic wrote to the court to say he would not attend the trial . The trial is still expected to begin on Monday despite Karadzic 's intended absence , which he announced in a letter to the court , the spokeswoman said . `` The tribunal judges control court proceedings . They are the only relevant body that can make a decision about the readiness of the case for trial , '' she said . Karadzic , who is defending himself , faces genocide charges and nine other counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Bosnian Muslims , Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbian civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s . The conflict introduced the phrase `` ethnic cleansing '' into the lexicon describing war crimes , as different factions in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia sought to kill or drive out other groups . Karadzic was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in Belgrade , the capital of Serbia , and practicing alternative medicine in disguise . In a letter dated Wednesday and made public Thursday , Karadzic complains that he has not been given the relevant case material on time -- and he says the volume of material would have been too much to go through even if he had received it promptly . `` I ask Your Excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages , only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest ? '' he writes . `` Why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date ? '' Karadzic says he should not be penalized for representing himself . `` No lawyer in this world could prepare defense within this period of time , '' he writes . `` I hereby inform you that my defense is not ready for my trial that is supposed to begin as scheduled , on the 26th of October , and that therefore I shall not appear before you on that date . '' He promised to continue his preparations in `` the most intensive way '' and inform the court when he is ready . The genocide charges against him stem partly from the most notorious massacre of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , once a part of Yugoslavia . More than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed at Srebrenica when ethnic Serb troops overran a U.N. `` safe area '' in July 1995 . It was the worst European massacre since World War II . Prosecutors at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague accuse Karadzic of responsibility . `` On 8 March 1995 , Karadzic instructed Bosnian Serb forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of Srebrenica , amongst other places , '' the tribunal said in a statement this month . The Hague indictment also says Karadzic committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-Serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen Bosnian municipalities in the early stages of the war . Karadzic , who faces life in prison if he is convicted , denies the charges . The court can not impose the death penalty . When he was arrested in July 2008 , Karadzic had grown a large white beard and let his famous steel-gray hair grow long and turn white . He had spent more than 13 years in hiding , during which he practiced alternative medicine at a Belgrade clinic . Karadzic 's arrest leaves his former military commander , Ratko Mladic , as the highest-ranking fugitive still being sought by the war crimes tribunal . Prosecutor Alan Tieger told the court in July that the case against Karadzic would take approximately 490 hours . That means prosecutors are likely to need more than a year to lay out their evidence , a court spokeswoman said . The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations . Karadzic was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office . Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and contractors last month appears in a newly released video , in which he vows revenge for the killing of a Taliban leader . The video shows Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi , whom a former U.S. intelligence official identified as the suicide bomber . Al-Balawi 's brother told CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson that the man in the video , who uses the alias Abu Dajana Al-Khorasani , was his sibling . In the tape , which aired Saturday on the Arabic satellite news channel Al-Jazeera , al-Balawi says his message is for the CIA and Jordanian intelligence . The December 30 bombing at a U.S. base in Khost , in southeastern Afghanistan , killed seven CIA operatives and a Jordanian army captain . Al-Balawi was a Jordanian doctor whom Jordanian authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source , a Jordanian official told CNN this week . Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri , al Qaeda 's No. 2 figure , a former U.S. intelligence official said . Al-Balawi says in the video that his faith can not be sold to bidders , an apparent message to Jordanian and U.S. officials that they had failed to win his allegiance . It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda . Gen. David Petraeus , head of U.S. Central Command , told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour that local officials are better at `` human intelligence '' than foreign agents . `` That 's not to say that you ca n't have some real breakthroughs , '' Petraeus said during the interview , to be aired Sunday . `` It 's not to say you ca n't develop sources , you ca n't put people in there and so forth . '' Al-Balawi mentions Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan who was killed in a missile strike last August . `` We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud , may God have mercy on his soul , '' he says in Arabic , according to a CNN translation . `` It will remain that we take revenge -LRB- for his death -RRB- in America and outside America . It is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of God , whom Baitullah Mehsud supported . '' Al Qaeda 's commander of operations in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu Yazid , said this week that the attack avenged Mehsud 's death . Mehsud was the leader of Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan -LRB- TTP -RRB- . It was TTP that released the video , according to IntelCenter , a think tank that specializes in tracking terrorist groups . At one point , the video shows the date of December 20 , 2009 . That is five days before Nigerian passenger Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit , Michigan . The Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot . It is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate , or whether al-Balawi was aware of AbdulMutallab 's alleged plans . If al-Balawi did know about the plot , it could indicate a greater degree of communication between TTP and al Qaeda than previously thought . In an analysis of the video , IntelCenter said there is a connection between the two groups . But IntelCenter also pointed out al-Balawi appears in the video next to TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud , and that it was TTP that released the video . `` The TTP and al Qaeda have a close relationship , and in all likelihood al Qaeda was involved at some level in the operation , '' IntelCenter said in an analysis of the video . `` However , the release of the video with TTP Emir Hakimullah Mehsud firmly places the attack under the TTP banner . '' Of the seven CIA operatives who were killed in the December 30 attack were two members of the private security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater . The Jordanian military officer who was killed was Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid , a cousin of Jordan 's King Abdullah II . It was one of the worst attacks ever on America 's intelligence community .

{"answer":"Colombo , Sri Lanka -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sri Lanka 's response to a scathing United Nations report alleging war crimes and human rights violations has reached the president 's desk . President Mahinda Rajapaksa received the 400-page document on Sunday night . The response , compiled by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission , will be presented to Parliament , though Rajapaksa did not say when . At their president 's urging , Sri Lankans took to the streets in May to rail against the U.N. report , which cites `` credible allegations '' that crimes were committed by both sides during the final stages of the country 's civil war . A three-member U.N. panel recommended that Sri Lanka immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law . Human rights groups have already alleged both government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war , which ended in May 2009 after the government declared victory . The rebels had fought a 26-year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced , according to the United Nations . The U.N. report concluded there were `` credible allegations , which , if proven , indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE -LRB- rebels -RRB- , some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity . '' In the war 's final stage , which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009 , the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni , where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting . The report said the government used `` large-scale and widespread shelling '' that left many civilians dead . Some of the shelling happened in no-fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate , the report said . Government forces also shelled a U.N. hub and food distribution lines and fired near International Committee of the Red Cross ships that were picking up the wounded , the report said . The government also shelled hospitals on the front lines , some of them repeatedly , the report said . `` Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling , '' the report said . A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Ban hopes the U.N. report `` will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the Sri Lankan government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace .

{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday , officials said . A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions , police said . Lohan 's attorney told CNN the warrant was issued `` out of a misunderstanding . '' It was not known whether she would attend the hearing Monday . The warrant was issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills , California . It apparently stems from Lohan 's 2007 convictions for drunken driving , police said Friday . She is serving three years probation . Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation . The district attorney 's office prosecuted the original 2007 case , she said . The hearing is set to begin sometime after 8:30 a.m. , she said . Lohan `` has the right to appear '' at the hearing , said Alan Parachini , Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman . `` That decision is up to her . '' Lohan 's attorney , Shawn Chapman Holley , told CNN on Sunday that she will appear at the hearing on Lohan 's behalf . `` Since her case was resolved , Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court , '' Holley said in a statement . `` The warrant issued on Friday was , in our view , born out of a misunderstanding which I am confident I can clear up next week , '' Holley said . Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan , as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases . Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in . Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges , with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident . The first arrest , in May 2007 , came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills . Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility , she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car . A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges . Lohan 's acting career , which started at age 10 on a soap opera , took off on the big screen a year later when she played both identical twins in Disney 's `` The Parent Trap . '' Since then , she has starred in at least a dozen movies , including `` Georgia Rule '' with Jane Fonda in 2007 . Her pop music recording career , boosted by her movie roles , has floundered in the past year . Her last album was released in 2005 . CNN 's Irving Last contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza moved a step closer Friday to extradition to the U.S. , where he faces terrorism-related charges . Abu Hamza al-Masri 's followers include the `` shoe bomber '' and the only person charged in the 9\/11 attacks . UK authorities had ordered his extradition , but he appealed . Britain 's High Court dismissed the appeal Friday , a spokesman for Britain 's Home Office said . That gives the Egyptian-born cleric , who lives in London , 14 days to apply to the High Court for permission to appeal to the House of Lords . The one-eyed , hook-handed cleric faces 11 terrorism-related charges in the U.S. . They include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping in Yemen and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad , or holy war , training camp in rural Bly , Oregon in 1999 . Abu Hamza , one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain , is already in prison for inciting racial hatred at his North London mosque . He was convicted in Britain on 11 terror-related charges and sentenced to seven years prison in 2006 . If he is extradited , his British sentence could be interrupted so he could stand trial in the U.S. , the Home Office has said . If he receives a prison sentence in the U.S. , he would return to England to complete his sentence there before serving time back in the States , the Home Office said . Abu Hamza formerly preached at the Finsbury Park Mosque in London . His followers included the so-called `` shoe bomber '' Richard Reid , who was convicted of trying to light a bomb in his shoes on a trans-Atlantic flight . They also included Zacarias Moussaoui , who was charged in the U.S. over the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks . The cleric was also convicted of possessing eight video and audio recordings , which prosecutors said he intended to distribute to stir up racial hatred . In all , police seized some 2,700 audio tapes and about 570 video tapes from two addresses -- one of them his home - during raids in 2003 . The material included a 10-volume `` encyclopedia '' of Afghan jihad , which prosecutor David Perry described as `` a manual for terrorism . '' The texts discussed how to make explosives , explained assassination methods and detailed the best means of attack . Both non-Muslims and Muslims condemned his preaching , which include praising the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the U.S. , calling al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a hero , and describing the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster as punishment from Allah because the astronauts were Christian , Hindu and Jewish .","question":""}
{"answer":"DUBAI , United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dubai has forgiven the nearly $ 7 billion Baghdad owes it , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced Sunday . UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan has promised to appoint an ambassador to Iraq . UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan promised to `` put out these debts , '' appoint an ambassador to Baghdad , and `` help Iraq building the holy shrines that were targeted by the terrorists , '' al-Maliki said in a written statement . Al-Maliki and the sheikh met Sunday , the first day of a two-day official visit . Al-Maliki was accompanied by the Iraqi ministers of Interior , Commerce and Industry . `` Our biggest challenge is now the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the economic situation and to provide services to our citizens , '' al-Maliki said . Debt relief is a major issue for Iraq , and the United States has urged other nations to forgive Iraqi debt , most of which is held by Arab states , U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said in late May . Also , the UAE Cabinet on Sunday nominated Abdullah Ibrahim al-Shehhi to be the country 's ambassador to Iraq . Al-Shehhi , who previously served as the Emirates ' ambassador to India , is to travel to Iraq after his nomination is confirmed . An official government source said the UAE intends to reopen its embassy in Baghdad by the end of the year . The United States and other nations have urged Arab countries to post ambassadors to Iraq , reopen embassies and forge closer relationships with Iraq 's government . The UAE mission in Iraq has n't been active since a UAE diplomat was kidnapped and released two years ago . The year before that , two Iraqis working for that mission were killed . No ambassador from an Arab country has been stationed permanently in Iraq since July 2005 , when Egypt 's ambassador , Dr. Ihab al-Sherif , was abducted from a Baghdad street and slain . Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the assassination , saying it had killed al-Sherif because of Egypt 's foreign policies and its alliances with the United States and Israel . The UAE 's announcement Sunday came a month after its foreign minister , Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan , visited Baghdad . During that visit , al-Nahyan extended the official invitation that brought al-Maliki to Dubai . Iraq 's government said that al-Nahyan 's one-day visit was the first to Iraq by a Gulf Cooperation Council foreign minister since the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled the regime of President Saddam Hussein . The Gulf Cooperation Council also includes Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and Saudi Arabia . Prior to al-Nahyan 's visit , only Syria and Jordan had sent foreign ministers to Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era . The Arab League 's secretary-general has also visited . War and the Sunni-Shiite rivalry in Iraq and the Muslim world have slowed the Arab world 's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iraq . Iraq 's mixed population is mostly Arab with some Kurds and Turkmens , and mostly Shiite Muslim , with a Sunni Muslim minority . Most Arab countries -- including the UAE -- are Sunni-ruled . Iraq 's government is Shiite-dominated and it is forging a close relationship with its neighbor , the non-Arab Shiite nation of Iran -- a development that concerns Arab nations wary of Iran 's Islamic Republic government . Al-Maliki 's government is seeking to develop close ties to all countries of the region . CNN 's Caroline Faraj in Dubai and Mohammed Tawfeeq in Baghdad contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Syrian-born naturalized American was ordered held in custody Wednesday after he was charged for allegedly spying on Syrian protesters in the United States . Judge Theresa Buchanan at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ordered Mohamad Anas Heitham Soueid , 47 , held until Friday , when there will be a detention hearing . Prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick told the judge that Soueid was a flight risk . Soueid , of Leesburg , Virginia , was charged October 5 with conspiring to collect video and audio recordings and other information about people `` in the United States and Syria who were protesting the government of Syria and to provide these materials to Syrian intelligence agencies in order to silence , intimidate and potentially harm the protestors , '' the Justice Department said Wednesday . The Syrian Embassy in Washington responded Wednesday by denying the allegations , saying Soueid never worked for the Syrian government to spy on protesters . Soueid was arrested Tuesday after a federal grand jury charged him in a six-count indictment . He is charged with conspiring to act and acting as an agent of the Syrian government in the United States without notifying the attorney general as required by law ; two counts of providing false statements on a firearms purchase form ; and two counts of providing false statements to federal law enforcement , the Justice Department said . This comes amid Syria 's seven-month-long crackdown against protesters . `` Today 's indictment alleges that the defendant acted as an unregistered agent of the Syrian government as part of an effort to collect information on people in this country protesting the Syrian government crackdown . I applaud the many agents , analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about today 's case , '' said Lisa Monaco , assistant attorney general for national security . The indictment says Soueid has been an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat , a reference to Syrian intelligence agencies . `` At no time while acting as an agent of the government of Syria in this country did Soueid provide prior notification to the Attorney General as required by law , the indictment alleges , '' the Justice Department said . `` Under the direction and control of Syrian officials , Soueid is accused of recruiting individuals living in the United States to collect information on and make audio and video recordings of protests against the Syrian regime -- including recordings of conversations with individual protesters -- in the United States and Syria . He is also charged with providing the recordings and other information to individuals working for the Mukhabarat . According to the indictment , Soueid and others conspired to use this information to undermine , silence , intimidate and potentially harm those in the United States and Syria who engaged in the protests . '' In late June , the Syrian government paid for Soueid to travel to Syria . He met with intelligence officials and privately spoke with President Bashar al-Assad , the indictment said . `` In addition to the recordings , Soueid is accused of providing the Mukhabarat contact information , including phone numbers and e-mail addresses , for protesters in the United States . In a handwritten letter sent to UCC-1 -LRB- an unindicted co-conspirator -RRB- , Soueid allegedly expressed his belief that violence against protesters -- including raiding their homes -- was justified and that any method should be used to deal with the protesters . The indictment also alleges that Soueid provided information regarding U.S. protesters against the Syrian regime to an individual who worked at the Syrian Embassy in Washington , D.C. '' In a statement , the Syrian Embassy challenged the Justice Department to provide evidence of the allegations . It said Soueid is not an agent of any Syrian institution and has never worked for any Syrian official . The allegation that any U.S. citizen is working with Syria to intimidate other U.S. citizens is `` absolutely baseless and totally unacceptable , '' the embassy said . Syria never paid Soueid for travel or any other expense , the embassy said . It also denied there had ever been a private meeting between Soueid and al-Assad , calling it a `` ludicrous '' accusation . It also said the embassy had never recruited anyone to inform on any activities in the United States . `` Contrary to the statement of the Department of Justice , Mr. Soueid has never provided any individual at the Syrian Embassy in the U.S. with any information regarding U.S. protesters or otherwise , '' it said . `` This is a flagrant effort to defame the Embassy of Syria based on sheer lies and fabrications . '' The indictment also said FBI agents interviewed Soueid and he is accused of lying `` when he denied that he had collected information on U.S. persons and transmitted that information to the government of Syria . '' `` In addition , Soueid allegedly made further false statements when he denied to FBI agents that he had directed someone to audio or videotape a conversation , meeting , rally or protest , or that he was aware of any individual taking photographs or videotaping people . He also allegedly made false statements when he denied that he had ever been an agent of the Syrian government or a foreign intelligence officer . '' `` The ability to assemble and protest is a cherished right in the United States , and it 's troubling that a U.S. citizen from Leesburg is accused of working with the Syrian government to identify and intimidate those who exercise that right , '' said Neil MacBride , U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia . `` Spying for another country is a serious threat to our national security , especially when it threatens the ability of U.S. citizens to engage in political speech within our own borders . '' If Soueid is convicted , he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison . Soueid is also known as Anas Alswaid , the Justice Department said . Alswaid had been named in a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Syrian citizens or Syrian-Americans who say they have been subjected to abuse or are family members of those who have been abused by the defendants . Along with Alswaid , the defendants include the Syrian Arab Republic , the Ministry of State Security Intelligence , al-Assad 's brother Maher , the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. , Imad Moustapha , and others . The suit was filed in May . `` Alswaid is an integral part of the criminal conspiracy to torture , maim , and kill Syrians . Through his efforts , the al-Assad regime learns the identities of Syrians based in the United States , who are trying to assist in the efforts to counteract the tactics of the al-Assad regime . He transmits such information to Damascus to initiate criminal conduct against the families of the identified Syrians , '' the suit alleges .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pregnant women in Peru are dying at scandalous rates , according to the author of an Amnesty International report into maternal mortality in the South American country . The report , `` Fatal Flaws : Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru '' found that hundreds of poor , rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country . It also concluded that the government 's response to tackling the problem was inadequate . Peruvian government figures state 185 in every 100,000 women die in childbirth , but the United Nations says the number is much higher , 240 per 100,000 , which makes it one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the Americas . In wealthy developed nations , only nine women die for every 100,000 births . The five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage , pre-eclampsia , infection , complications following abortion and obstructed birth , according to Peru 's Ministry of Health figures . Amnesty 's Peru researcher Nuria Garcia said , in a written statement : `` The rates of maternal mortality in Peru are scandalous . The fact that so many women are dying from preventable causes is a human rights violation . `` The Peruvian state is simply ignoring its obligation to provide adequate maternal health care to all women , regardless of who they are and where they live . '' Garcia added : `` Health services for pregnant women in Peru are like a lottery : If you are poor and indigenous , the chances are you will always lose . '' The report said pregnant women in Peru die because they lack access to emergency obstetric care , to information on maternal health , and to health staff members who can speak Indigenous languages such as Quechua -- a native Andean language spoken by some 5 million people in Peru . According to the report , 27 percent of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes occurred during pregnancy ; 26 percent occurred during the birth itself ; and 46 percent during the first six weeks after giving birth . A 2007 Census of Indigenous People showed that 60 percent did not have access to a health facility , said Amnesty International . The Amnesty International report notes that the Peruvian government has instituted policies aimed at reducing the rates of maternal mortality , such as increasing maternal waiting houses -- rooms where pregnant women who live far from health centers can stay . Other measures include more training for health staff members on the vertical birth method common among indigenous women and teaching the Quiche language to health professionals , Amnesty International said . But the human rights group said Peruvian women and health professionals have complained that the measures are not being implemented effectively . For example , the rights group said , even though the number of waiting houses has increased more than threefold in the past eight years , only half of them are in rural areas . The agency also contends that training for health professionals on the vertical birth method is not sufficiently widespread . According to Peru 's Human Rights ombudsperson , more than 45 percent of health staff last year said they had not received appropriate training , Amnesty International said . `` Official initiatives to reduce maternal mortality are good news , '' Garcia said . `` However , lack of clear responsibilities for implementing them and the absence of effective resourcing and monitoring puts any initiative in great jeopardy . '' Though Peru 's rate of maternal deaths is high , it pales in comparison to sub-Saharan Africa , which has about 900 deaths for each 100,000 births , the United Nations says . For Africa as a whole , the number is 820 . The highest rates were in Sierra Leone , with 2,000 , and Afghanistan , with 1,900 . Latin America and the Caribbean average 130 deaths per 100,000 births , the United Nations says , with the lowest rates in Chile , Costa Rica and Cuba . Worldwide , there were an average of 400 deaths for each 100,000 births in the year 2000 , the United Nations says . The lowest rates were in Iceland , with zero , and Austria , with four per 100,000 births . The United States had 11 deaths per 100,000 births in 2005 , the United Nations says .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lillo Brancato Jr. , an actor who appeared in `` The Sopranos , '' was acquitted of the 2005 killing an off-duty New York City police officer but found guilty of attempted burglary . Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on `` The Sopranos '' and played alongside Robert De Niro in `` A Bronx Tale . '' Brancato , 32 , was also acquitted of two counts of burglary , but could face three to 15 years in prison on the attempted burglary charge . He has already served three years , according to his attorney , Joseph Tacopina . Police officer Daniel Enchautegui , 28 , was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor 's house in the Bronx in December 2005 . During the trial , Brancato said there was not a break-in . Brancato said he knew the owner of the home , and that he and friend Steven Armento , 51 , were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium . Brancato told the jury that the owner , a Vietnam veteran , gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted . Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home , but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs . When Brancato and Armento entered the home , the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate . That 's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum . Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November . The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento . Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery , but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying . `` This jury spoke loud and clear , that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer , '' Tacopina said . Brancato appeared on six episodes of the hit HBO series `` The Sopranos '' as a wannabe mobster in 2000 . As a teen , Brancato starred alongside actor Robert De Niro in `` A Bronx Tale .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an Alabama teenager in Aruba in 2005 , based on new evidence in the case , prosecutors announced Wednesday . Natalee Holloway disappeared while on an Aruba vacation in 2005 . Brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were arrested in Aruba at the same time authorities in the Netherlands picked up Joran Van der Sloot at the request of the Aruban government , the statement said . Van der Sloot is attending school in Holland . The three had previously been arrested in 2005 , Aruban prosecutors noted in a statement , but a court released them , citing insufficient evidence . They are now charged with `` involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of Natalee Holloway or causing serious bodily harm to Natalee Holloway , resulting in her death , '' the statement said . Watch interview with Holloway 's father '' Van der Sloot , now 20 , and the Kalpoes , now ages 24 and 21 , were the last people seen with Holloway , 18 , as she left Carlos n ' Charlie 's nightclub in Oranjestad , Aruba , about 1:30 a.m. on May 30 , 2005 . All three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance . View a timeline of the case '' No information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests . Aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the Netherlands has been reviewing the Holloway case at the request of authorities in Aruba , and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation . The Kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by Aruban police Wednesday , Aruba prosecutor Dop Kruimel told CNN . They will appear before a judge Friday for a preliminary arrest hearing , in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible , she said . The judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days , meaning police have that much time to produce evidence . The suspects then go before a judge again , she said . Van der Sloot was arrested in Arnhem , the Netherlands , by Dutch police , Kruimel said . Aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to Aruba within eight days . Because they were not familiar with the case , Dutch police were not questioning Van der Sloot , she said . He will be questioned when he is brought back to Aruba , she said . However , he will appear before a judge Thursday in Arnhem . When CNN called the Kalpoe household , the person who answered the phone hung up . Earlier , Van der Sloot 's mother , Anita Van der Sloot , told CNN her son had not been arrested , but had only reported to a police station in the Netherlands for questioning Wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so . Anita Van der Sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in Aruba . She said a Dutch attorney was with him , and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released Thursday . Meanwhile , a spokeswoman for Holloway 's mother , Beth Holloway , said in a statement , `` The family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case . '' Beth Holloway was refusing interviews for now , said spokeswoman Sunny Tillman . She previously was known as Beth Holloway-Twitty , but has returned to using Holloway after a divorce earlier this year . Natalee Holloway was visiting Aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama , when she went to Carlos n ' Charlie 's that night in 2005 . The group had planned to leave for home the following day , and Holloway 's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight . Her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the United States , Aruba , the Netherlands and beyond , but Holloway has never been found . Aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case . At least 10 men , including Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes , have been arrested and identified as suspects either in Holloway 's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up . All were questioned and released . Legal experts , however , have said differences in the U.S. and Aruban systems should be taken into account . Aruba 's criminal justice system is based on Dutch law and a descendant of the Napoleonic code . In Aruba , authorities ' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest , while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect 's guilt or innocence . There are no jury trials . Aruban authorities , meanwhile , have suggested that Holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning . Beth Holloway and Natalee Holloway 's father , Dave Holloway , filed a lawsuit last year against Van der Sloot and his father , Aruban judge Paulus Van der Sloot , in the Supreme Court of the State of New York . The Van der Sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to New York . However , a judge in August 2006 dismissed the suit , saying New York was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it . It was unclear whether Holloway 's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere . E-mail to a friend CNN 's Kimberly Segal and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"What the heck are triglycerides ? If you do n't know , you have plenty of company . One in every three Americans has high triglyceride levels , which elevate risk of heart disease and early death . The fatty particles found in your blood are important for heart health , but do n't get nearly as much attention as , say , cholesterol . Now a new study suggests that there 's a good chance that your triglycerides are in the unhealthy zone , whether you know what they are or not . About one-third of American adults have triglyceride levels that are borderline or too high , according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine . `` I see it as a major problem that we 've completely ignored this problem so far , '' said Dr. B\u00f8rge Nordestgaard of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark . Nordestgaard has conducted research linking high triglyceride levels to cardiovascular disease and early death , but was not involved in the CDC research . `` Everyone in clinical practice seemed to be so focused on LDL , LDL , LDL -LSB- bad cholesterol -RSB- , people tended to forget triglycerides . '' he said . Being too heavy , getting too little activity , drinking lots of alcohol and eating lots of saturated fat can all add up to higher triglyceride levels because the body stores excess calories as triglycerides . Health.com : Fats to eat , fats to avoid Triglycerides are a third type of fatty particle found in the blood , along with LDL cholesterol and HDL -LRB- also known as good -RRB- cholesterol . People taking certain medications or those who have diabetes or a genetic condition can have high triglycerides . Health.com : What cholesterol tests reveal about your heart 's health Nordestgaard said that high triglycerides are as dangerous as high cholesterol levels as a risk marker for heart disease and early death . `` There 's a really big potential for further prevention of heart disease and strokes by getting more focused on that , '' he said . Health.com : How stress can trigger heart problems The problem : Right now , the best way to attack high triglycerides is by losing weight , eating more healthily , and becoming more active -- a tall order for many of us . In the new report , Dr. Earl Ford of the CDC , and his colleagues looked at a nationally representative group of 5,610 people 20 and older . They found that 33.1 percent had triglyceride levels above 150 milligrams per deciliter , while 17.9 percent had levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter , 1.7 percent had levels of 500 milligrams per deciliter or above , and 0.4 percent had levels higher than 1,000 milligrams per deciliter . Triglycerides of 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter are considered borderline high and anything above 200 milligrams per deciliter is considered too high . Men were more likely than women to have high triglycerides , while whites were at greater risk than African Americans and Mexican Americans . Very high triglyceride levels can cause inflammation of the pancreas . Although there 's increasing evidence that elevated triglycerides are associated with cardiovascular disease and early death , no one has yet shown that treating high triglyceride levels reduces cardiovascular disease , according to an editorial by Dr. Warren G. Thompson and Dr. Gerald T. Gau of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine , in Rochester , Minnesota . Lifestyle changes -- exercising , losing weight , swapping healthy fats for unhealthy ones , and the like -- are the treatment of choice right now for people with triglyceride levels between 150 milligrams per deciliter and 500 milligrams per deciliter . According to the National Cholesterol Education Panel , higher-risk people with triglyceride levels falling in this range may also need medication . Beyond lifestyle changes , treatments for high triglycerides include statins , fibrates , niacin , and fish oil . But while fibrates reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack , Thompson and Gau note , they do n't reduce mortality and actually increase the risk of death from non-heart-related causes ; they are only recommended for people with triglycerides above 1,000 milligrams per deciliter . `` What we really need scientifically , we need companies to come up with drugs that are more efficient at particularly reducing triglycerides , '' said Nordestgaard . He usually recommends that people try statins first if lifestyle changes are not enough -- as do Thompson and Gau . Health.com : The therapeutic lifestyle changes -LRB- TLC -RRB- diet for heart disease `` People with hypertriglyceridemia should talk to their physician about appropriate steps to take to bring their levels of triglycerides down , '' said Ford . `` For people with levels in the 150-500 milligrams per deciliter range , therapeutic lifestyle change is recommended .

{"answer":"After years of rising cholesterol levels from fatty diets and pudgy waistlines , there 's finally good news , experts say . More people who are trying to lower their cholesterol are actually succeeding in getting their low-density lipoprotein , or bad cholesterol , down to healthy levels . Research suggests that decreasing LDL -- via drugs , exercise and\/or diet -- can ward off heart attacks and strokes . However , there 's still room for improvement , according to research from nine countries , including the United States and Canada . And there 's good reason to stay focused on lowering your cholesterol : Research suggests that decreasing LDL can ward off heart attacks , strokes , and other health problems . In the new study , which was funded by Pfizer and published in Circulation : Journal of the American Heart Association , an international group of researchers led by David D. Waters , M.D. , of the University of California , San Francisco , looked at 9,955 people with an average age of 62 to see whether cholesterol-lowering efforts -- including taking medication or trying diet and exercise alone -- were having the intended effect . For healthy people , the current target for LDL cholesterol is less than 160 mg\/dL , and for those with two or more heart disease risk factors , it 's less than 130 mg\/dL . For people with heart disease , LDL should be less than 100 mg\/dL and possibly even less than 70 mg\/dL for those at super-high risk . The survey , known as the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project 2 , is an update of a similar survey done in the United States in 1996 and 1997 . At that time , just 38 percent of Americans in general and 18 percent of people with heart disease who were trying to lower cholesterol actually had their LDL cholesterol under control . Health.com : 4 tips for healthy drinking while dieting Things have definitely gotten better . Waters and his colleagues found that in 2006 -- 2007 , 73 percent of people had their LDL cholesterol in an acceptable range . This included 86 percent of people at relatively low risk of heart problems , 74 percent at moderate risk , and 67 percent at high risk . But just one in three people , or 30 percent , who already had heart disease and at least two other risk factors -LRB- such as obesity and smoking -RRB- had their LDL cholesterol in the healthy range . About 75 percent of the patients in the survey were taking statins , 16 percent were treated with only diet and exercise , and the remainder took a cholesterol-lowering medication that was not a statin . Statins include brand-name drugs like Lipitor , Zocor , and Crestor , among others . The findings `` should be a wake-up call '' to people who already have or are at risk of heart attack and strokes , says Gregg Fonarow , M.D. , the codirector of the UCLA Preventative Cardiology Program , who was not involved with the research . People with cardiovascular disease should not `` assume that just because they 're under medical care that they 've optimized their cardiovascular health , '' he says . Health.com : Ultimate guide to fresh fruits and veggies However , Dan Hackam , M.D. , Ph.D. , of the University of Western Ontario and the Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre in London , Ontario , says the survey may not be a fair representation of people with high cholesterol . The survey included only people who had been using the same cholesterol-lowering approach for at least three months . `` There 's lots of people in the general population who should be on these drugs who are n't on them , '' Hackam says . `` I see a lot of patients who 've had heart attacks and strokes who are n't on these medications . '' Nevertheless , according to Hackam , the findings are `` very good news . '' When the original survey was done , he says , there were just a couple of major clinical trials showing the health benefits of cholesterol reduction with statins .

{"answer":"Alexandria , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson was sentenced Friday to 13 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release for his conviction on 11 counts of corruption . Jefferson was also ordered to forfeit more than $ 470,000 after his conviction for using his office to solicit bribes . He will also have to pay $ 1,100 in special assessments . The case against the former nine-term Louisiana Democrat included allegations of influence-peddling and the discovery of $ 90,000 in cash in his freezer . Judge T.S. Ellis will determine at a hearing next Wednesday whether Jefferson will remain free pending appeal . Until then , he is free . `` The court 's sentence today reaffirms the principle that all people -- no matter what their title or position -- are equal before the law , '' said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman in a statement . `` In a stunning betrayal of the public 's trust , former Congressman Jefferson repeatedly used his public office for private gain . The lengthy prison sentence imposed on Mr. Jefferson today is a stark reminder to all public officials that the consequences of accepting bribes can and will be severe . '' Jefferson 's family was in the courtroom when District Judge T.S. Ellis handed down the sentence . He had faced up to 150 years in prison . `` This sentence should be a clear signal that our society will not tolerate bribery , '' U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a written statement . `` It 's not just another cost of doing business in government . `` Mr. Jefferson 's repeated attempts to sell his office caused significant damage to the public 's trust in our elected leaders . This sentence will begin to repair that damage and to restore that trust . `` Mr. Jefferson is well-known for the $ 90,000 found in his freezer . It is our hope that he will now be well-known for the tough sentence handed down today , showing that no one -- including our elected officials -- are above the law . '' Jefferson , of New Orleans , still faces the forfeiture of nearly $ 500,000 -- money a jury said is linked to criminal activity for which he has been convicted . On August 5 , a jury found Jefferson guilty on four bribery counts , three counts of money laundering , three counts of wire fraud and one count of racketeering . He was acquitted on five other counts , including wire fraud and obstruction of justice . He had remained free prior to Friday 's sentencing . Jefferson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 4 , 2007 , about two years after federal agents said they found the money in his freezer . Authorities said the cash was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on video . The trial was delayed while it was resolved whether an FBI search of Jefferson 's congressional office was constitutional . Defense attorney Robert Trout had asked the judge for leniency , citing Jefferson 's personal history of humble beginnings and long-standing public service . Prosecutors , in turn , filed a response saying Jefferson deserved no preferential treatment since he `` still chose to cheat , steal and lie . '' `` Congressman Jefferson has still not accepted responsibility for his own criminal conduct , '' prosecutors wrote . He `` still rationalizes his own unethical , illegal and immoral conduct .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a revised indictment charging him in a corruption and tax evasion case , according to a spokesman for the New York District Attorney . A revised indictment brings to 15 the number of counts against former police Commissioner Bernard Kerik . The revised indictment includes two new counts of aiding the filing of false returns and a charge involving making false statements while applying for a housing loan , spokesman Herbert Hadad of the district attorney 's office told CNN . Kerik is accused of failing to report more than $ 500,000 in income between 1999 and 2004 , said Patricia Haynes , the IRS agent in charge of the case . Prosecutors allege Kerik received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York . Revisions to the original indictment , which included charges of corruption , conspiracy and tax evasion , bring to 15 the number of counts against Kerik . Barry Berke , Kerik 's attorney , declined to comment . The indictment also charges that Kerik made several false statements to the White House and other federal officials when he applied for the position as adviser to the Homeland Security Advisory Council , to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and in connection with his nomination to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson did not rule Monday on whether the two counts that include charges of lying to White House officials will be tried in Washington or White Plains , New York . Kerik is due back in court February 3 for a hearing on pretrial motions , Hadad said . A trial date has not been set . Kerik , 53 , is a longtime friend and former protege of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani . President Bush nominated him to be secretary of homeland security after winning re-election in 2004 , but Kerik withdrew his name amid allegations that he employed a nanny who had a questionable immigration status . Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson began investigating allegations that Kerik had traded payment on repairs to his Bronx apartment for favors , including city contracts . The former chief pleaded guilty in 2006 to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he worked as city corrections commissioner . He was fined $ 221,000 and avoided jail time under his plea agreement . Before tapping Kerik for a Cabinet post , Bush dispatched him to Baghdad to train Iraqi police after the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein . He left three months into an expected six-month stint , with Iraqi officials telling reporters that he had completed his assignment . In 2004 , he campaigned for Bush 's re-election and spoke at the Republican National Convention in New York . CNN 's Mary Snow contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The box office had to contend with the World Series , a very early snowstorm in the Northeast , and Halloween festivities across the country this weekend , but audiences still managed to make it to the movies ! That being said , grosses for new releases `` Puss in Boots , '' `` In Time , '' and `` The Rum Diary , '' were n't all that strong . Check out how they performed below : Dreamworks Animation 's `` Puss in Boots '' was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a $ 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens , and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters . On paper , that number sounds good -- and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a `` Real Steel '' - ish caveat . `` Puss in Boots '' cost $ 130 million to produce , and it earned Dreamworks ' third-worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only `` Flushed Away '' and `` Antz , '' which started with $ 18.8 million and $ 17.2 million , respectively . The 3-D `` Shrek '' - spinoff , cost as much as Dreamworks ' `` Megamind , '' which opened in early November 2010 , but that film began with $ 46 million , and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $ 148.4 million total . `` Puss in Boots '' entered theaters a week earlier , but it will need to endure even better than `` Megamind '' to earn back its budget . The `` A - '' CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible , but considering people are already familiar with the `` Puss in Boots '' character , it 's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers . We wo n't officially know where `` Puss in Boots '' is headed until next weekend , when we see how much the snowstorm , the World Series , and Halloween really affected the box office this frame . -LRB- My guess is not much -- and I 'm not just being catty . -RRB- Second place belonged to `` Paranormal Activity 3 , '' which fell by 65 percent to $ 18.5 million in its second weekend . The found footage horror sequel has scared up $ 81.3 million after ten days in theaters , and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween , `` PA3 '' is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2 's $ 84.8 million cume . Not too shabby for a film that cost Paramount only $ 5 million to make ! Fall Movies : Get the latest news , photos , and more Fox 's $ 40 million Justin Timberlake\/Amanda Seyfried thriller `` In Time '' underwhelmed with just $ 12 million in its opening weekend . That debut is less than Timberlake 's last film , `` Friends with Benefits , '' which began with $ 18.6 million on its way to $ 55.8 million , as well as Seyfried 's recent `` Red Riding Hood , '' which debuted with $ 14 million on its way to $ 37.6 million . Ads for `` In Time '' failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time-shifting story , and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away . Timberlake 's leading man status may not have helped matters too much , either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble , like in `` The Social Network '' and `` Bad Teacher . '' Moviegoers issued `` In Time '' an unenthusiastic `` B - '' CinemaScore grade , which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller `` Source Code '' -LRB- $ 14.8 million opening , $ 54.7 million total -RRB- enjoyed earlier this year . In its third weekend , dancing remake `` Footloose '' fell to fourth place , dropping 48 percent to $ 5.4 million . The $ 24 million production has now earned $ 38.5 million after 17 days in theaters , and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough 's first feature film , `` Burlesque '' -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- , sometime this week . Johnny Depp 's latest , `` The Rum Diary , '' stumbled out of the gate with just $ 5 million . `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' this was not . The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp 's other substance abuse picture , 1998\u00e2 $ \u00b2 s `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , '' which debuted to $ 3.3 million and earned $ 10.7 million total . `` The Rum Diary 's '' edgy story was always going to be a tough sell , and FilmDistrict 's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits : `` While we all wish the numbers were better , we 're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson . '' The $ 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict , the young distributor that found success with Insidious -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- earlier this year . The studio has since struggled with both `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark '' -LRB- $ 23.9 million -RRB- and `` Drive '' -LRB- $ 33.7 million so far -RRB- recently . Unfortunately for FilmDistrict , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave `` The Rum Diary '' a harsh `` C '' CinemaScore grade , so it 's not likely to hold well in future weeks . Talk about a bad hangover ... In limited release , Sony 's Shakespeare tale `` Anonymous '' started with $ 1 million out of 256 theaters . That was good enough for a $ 3,774 per theater average , which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks . Young romance `` Like Crazy '' fared better , grossing $ 120,000 out of only 4 theaters , resulting in a $ 30,000 average . Richard Gere 's latest , `` The Double , '' was D.O.A. , pulling in only $ 27,545 out of 11 theaters . It 's not likely to platform much further . Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller `` Margin Call '' continued to play fairly well , grossing $ 713,000 out of 140 theaters . It has earned $ 1.5 million so far . Internationally , `` The Adventures of Tintin '' got off to an excellent start . Sony 's motion capture animation grossed $ 55.8 million out of 19 territories , including $ 21.5 million in France and $ 10.7 million in the United Kingdom , where its being distributed by Paramount . Sony is bragging loudly about the film 's performance , perhaps in response to some prognosticators claiming that `` Tintin '' is likely to underperform domestically . -LRB- The picture is based on a series of comic books by Herg\u00c3 \u00a9 which were very popular in Europe , but only cult hits in the U.S. -RRB- We 'll find out how excited audiences are about `` Tintin '' on December 21 . 1 . `` Puss in Boots '' -- $ 34 million 2 . `` Paranormal Activity 3 '' -- $ 18.5 mil 3 . `` In Time '' -- $ 12 mil 4 . `` Footloose '' -- $ 5.4 mil 5 . `` The Rum Diary '' -- $ 5 mil 6 . `` Real Steel '' -- $ 4.7 mil 7 . `` The Three Musketeers '' -- $ 3.5 mil 8 . `` The Ides of March '' -- $ 2.7 mil 9 . `` Moneyball '' -- $ 2.4 mil 10 . `` Courageous '' -- $ 1.8 mil See full article at EW.com .

{"answer":"Men who are circumcised are less likely to get sexually transmitted infections such as genital herpes and human papillomavirus -LRB- HPV -RRB- , but not syphilis , according to a study of adult African men published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine . Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe , but they 've been on the decline . The finding adds to the evidence that there are health benefits to circumcision . It was already known that circumcision can reduce the risk of penile cancer , a relatively rare disease . In a previous study , the same research team found that adult circumcision could reduce the risk of HIV infection . Efforts to increase the practice of male circumcision in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted infections , including Africa , could have a tremendous benefit , say the study 's authors . Genital herpes has been associated with an increased risk of HIV , and HPV can cause genital warts as well as a higher risk of anal , cervical -LRB- in women -RRB- , and penile cancers . Health.com : Is your partner cheating ? How to protect yourself In the United States , infant circumcision is declining . About 64 percent of American male infants were circumcised in 1995 , down from more than 90 percent in the 1970s . Rates tend to be higher in whites -LRB- 81percent -RRB- than in blacks -LRB- 65 percent -RRB- or Hispanics -LRB- 54 percent -RRB- . Some opponents say the removal of the foreskin is an unnecessary surgical procedure that may reduce sexual sensitivity in adulthood . In Jewish and Muslim cultures , young or infant boys are routinely circumcised for religious reasons . Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe , but the American Academy of Pediatrics currently says that the medical benefits are insufficient to recommend circumcision for all baby boys . In the new study , a research team at the Rakai Health Sciences Program in Uganda -- in collaboration with researchers from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , Maryland , and Makerere University in Uganda -- conducted two clinical trials involving 3,393 uncircumcised men ages 15 to 49 . All the men were negative for HIV and genital herpes -LRB- also known as herpes simplex virus type 2 -RRB- ; a subgroup of men also tested negative for HPV . Roughly half of the men underwent medically supervised circumcision at the start of the trial , while the other half were circumcised two years later . Overall , circumcision reduced the men 's risk of genital herpes by 28 percent -LRB- 10.3 percent of uncircumcised men developed genital herpes compared with 7.8 percent of circumcised men -RRB- and HPV infection by 35 percent -LRB- 27.8 percent of uncircumcised men were infected with HPV compared with 18 percent of circumcised men -RRB- . Circumcision did not , however , protect against syphilis . -LRB- About 2 percent of men in both groups contracted syphilis . -RRB- Health.com : A sexual risk taker comes to terms with drinking , depression , and STDs Study coauthor Thomas C. Quinn , M.D. , professor of global health at Johns Hopkins University , says that choosing circumcision , whether it 's the parents of an infant or an adult male for himself , is and should remain an individual decision . `` But the critics need to really look at the benefits versus the risks , '' he adds . `` By now a large body of evidence has shown that the health benefits clearly outweigh the minor risk associated with the surgery . In our study , we did n't see any adverse effects or mutilation . We 're recommending supervised , safe , sterile environments -- not circumcision out in an open field with rusty instruments . '' Increasing circumcision rates in Africa may not only help men , but would likely protect women too , possibly lowering the rates of female cervical cancer , the authors say . Ronald H. Gray , M.D. , professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University and study coauthor , says that the researchers plan to look at whether male circumcision reduces the transmission of HPV to female sexual partners . Health.com : 10 questions to ask a new partner before having sex Even in the United States , this study has relevance , says Anthony Fauci , M.D. , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -LRB- which funded one of the trials -RRB- . `` In this country , circumcision for infant boys remains a personal decision for the parents , '' he says . `` This makes us rethink whether doctors should be more aggressive in recommending that it at least be considered . If parents say no just because generations before them have said no , they should learn more about the significant health benefits before making that choice . '' Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults have had at least one HPV infection , according to an editorial by Matthew R. Golden , M.D. , and Judith N. Wasserheit , M.D. , both of the University of Washington . Although vaccines against some of the most dangerous HPV strains have been approved for girls ages 13 to 26 , the vaccines are expensive and routine Pap tests are still necessary to pick up cervical cancers . Health.com : How to tell your ex you have an STD Golden and Wasserheit note that `` rates of circumcision are declining and are lowest among black and Hispanic patients , groups in whom rates of HIV , herpes , and cervical cancer are disproportionately high . '' Medicaid , which insures many low-income patients in these populations , does not pay for routine infant circumcision in 16 states . The study authors hope that this growing evidence in favor of circumcision will persuade policy-making bodies , both in the United States and in other countries , to officially recommend the procedure -- which could make patient education and insurance coverage more likely . It 's not clear why circumcision may affect infection rates . But the study authors suggest that penile foreskin may provide a moist , favorable environment for herpes and HPV to survive and enter cells on the skin 's surface . Once the foreskin is surgically removed , the risk of infection may be reduced .

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean last April has been charged with involvement in two additional hijackings , authorities said Tuesday . One of the hijacked vessels is still being held hostage , federal prosecutors said in announcing a 10-count indictment filed against Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse . The vessels are identified in court documents as `` Ship-1 '' and `` Ship-2 . '' Under the indictment , Muse faces charges including piracy ; seizing a ship by force ; kidnapping and hostage taking , along with charges of possessing a machine gun in the commission of other offenses . If convicted , he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison . He was to be arraigned on the additional charges Tuesday afternoon in federal court , authorities said . Muse is accused of participating in the two hijackings before the Maersk Alabama was hijacked April 8 , prosecutors said in a statement . Ship-1 was seized by pirates in March in the Indian Ocean , according to the indictment and a criminal complaint . Authorities say Muse and others `` known and unknown '' boarded the vessel while armed with guns , threatened its captain and took control , holding the ship 's captain and crew hostage . While on the ship , prosecutors said , Muse aimed a gun at one of the hostages and threatened to kill him . He also showed a hostage what appeared to be an improvised explosive device , the statement said . `` Muse placed the IED in the vicinity of the hostage , and indicated that if the authorities came the IED would explode and the hostage would be killed . '' In April , Muse and the others left Ship-1 on a small boat , called `` the skiff , '' prosecutors said . When the skiff returned , the ship and the skiff `` were made to rendezvous '' with another ship , Ship-2 . `` The captain of Ship-1 was ordered to pull Ship-1 up to Ship-2 . Ship-1 was then attached to Ship-2 , '' according to the statement . `` Muse and others held hostage , on board Ship-2 , both the captain and the crew of Ship-1 and the captain and crew of Ship-2 . '' On April 8 , Muse and three others left Ship-2 and boarded the Maersk Alabama , the indictment said . Prosecutors allege the four fired shots at the Maersk Alabama before boarding it . The captain and crew of Ship-2 are still being held hostage , according to the documents . The indictment does not say what happened to Ship-1 , its captain or crew . The Maersk Alabama was attacked about 350 miles off the Somali coast , authorities have previously said . Muse allegedly demanded that the ship be stopped , then he and others allegedly took a life boat and held the captain of the ship -- Capt. Richard Phillips -- hostage on it . The USS Bainbridge came to the assistance of the vessel , and in radio communications , Muse and the others threatened to kill Phillips if they were not guaranteed safe passage away from the scene , authorities have said . On April 12 , Muse boarded the Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the others in exchange for Phillips ' release , according to a criminal complaint . While he was away from the lifeboat , Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates , authorities said . Muse was taken into custody . `` Piracy on the high seas is a threat against the community of nations , '' Preet Bharara , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , said in the statement Tuesday . `` Today 's indictment alleges criminal conduct that extends beyond the attack against the captain and crew of the American-flagged Maersk Alabama . Modern-day pirates who wreak havoc off faraway coasts will be met with modern-day justice in the United States . '' The investigation is continuing , Bharara said . A federal judge ruled in April that Muse could be tried as an adult . His father in Somalia told defense attorneys he was born November 20 , 1993 , meaning he would have been 15 at the time of the hijackings . However , the prosecution argued otherwise , saying Muse made statements suggesting he was older .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former baseball great Lenny Dykstra reached a deal with prosecutors , pleading no contest Wednesday to three counts of grand theft auto and filing a false financial statement , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office said . Dykstra , a three-time Major League Baseball All-Star who led the New York Mets to a World Series championship , was released pending sentencing Jan. 20 , 2012 , the office said in a statement . The former athlete , who faces up to four years in prison , admitted the loss was more than $ 100,000 , according to a statement from the district attorney 's office . In exchange for Dykstra 's plea , 21 charges against him , including attempted grand theft auto , identity theft , possession of a controlled substance and unauthorized possession of a syringe , will be dismissed at sentencing , according to the statement . Beginning in January , Dykstra , 48 , and two co-defendants tried to lease various high-end automobiles from several area dealerships by providing fraudulent information and claiming credit through a phony business , prosecutors said . A criminal complaint contended that Dykstra and Robert Hymers , 27 , his accountant , provided information from a man they claimed was a co-signer , but who had not authorized his name to be used . Leases were not approved at two dealerships , but the pair and Christopher Gavanis , 30 , a friend of Dykstra 's , drove off with three cars at one company by providing fraudulent information to a dealer , Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen said . When Dykstra was arrested in April , Los Angeles police detectives allegedly found cocaine and ecstasy along with somatropin , a synthetic human growth hormone , when they searched his Encino home . In September , Hymers pleaded no contest to one felony count of identity theft . Gavanis pleaded no contest to one felony count of filing a false financial statement , prosecutors said . In a separate case , Dykstra was indicted in May on federal charges , including obstruction of justice for allegedly taking more than $ 400,000 in property that should have gone to his bankruptcy creditors and then lying about it under oath , prosecutors claim . Dykstra 's stellar professional baseball career began in 1981 , when the New York Mets drafted him out of high school . During his second year in the majors , the player nicknamed `` Nails '' for his tenacity , hit a lead-off home run in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series at Boston 's Fenway Park , after the Mets lost the first two games . That spark rallied the Mets to a seven-game series victory over the Boston Red Sox . CNN 's Stan Wilson contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The brother of skater Nancy Kerrigan , charged with assault and battery in an incident involving his father , was released on bond , authorities said Wednesday . Mark Kerrigan posted the previously set $ 10,000 bail and was released from custody , according to the Woburn District Court Clerk 's office in Massachusetts . Kerrigan , 45 , was fitted with a tracking device and under conditions of his release is not allowed to leave his home other than to visit his attorney , the clerk 's office said . He also is forbidden to use any drugs or alcohol other than prescription medication , can have no access to weapons and must have mental health counseling . `` The Kerrigan family is delighted to have Mark back with them , '' family spokeswoman Nancy Sterling said in a statement . `` They ask that you respect their privacy as they welcome Mark home . '' He was arraigned in January and pleaded not guilty to charges he assaulted his father , Daniel Kerrigan , 70 . The elder Kerrigan died January 24 after an alleged altercation with his 45-year-old son at the family 's home in Stoneham , Massachusetts . Mark Kerrigan , through his attorney , has denied any responsibility in his father 's death . Daniel Kerrigan 's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner , but Middlesex County prosecutors have not said whether other charges might be filed against the younger Kerrigan in light of the finding . The Kerrigan family has said , in a statement released through their attorney , that they believe the medical examiner 's finding to be `` premature and inaccurate . '' `` The Kerrigan family does not blame anyone for the unfortunate death of Dan Kerrigan , who had a pre-existing heart condition , '' said the family statement , released by attorney Tracy Miner . According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley , police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. January 24 from Brenda Kerrigan , wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan . Keeley told District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son , resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor . Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities `` that he did in fact have an argument with his father , the argument became physical , he grabbed his father around the neck , and at some point the father collapsed to the floor . '' According to Keeley , police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house , `` clearly intoxicated '' and `` extremely combative . '' He refused to comply with police officers , said Keeley , and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home . Mark Kerrigan 's attorney , Denise Moore , said in court that Kerrigan was unemployed , was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents . He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress , apparently from his time in the Army , she added . Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France . In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer , Norway .

{"answer":"DURBAN , South Africa -- India 's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket 's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday . Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad Paul Collingwood 's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban . England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians , who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday 's must-win clash with the hosts . Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history , needing just 12 deliveries , as India made 218-4 . The left-hander 's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket . South Africa 's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year , while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches . Singh 's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over , in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once . Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls , putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir , who hit 58 off 41 deliveries . Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs , while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45 . In reply , England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs . Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls , and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries , but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh . Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs , while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28 . If India can beat South Africa , it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through . The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand , who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat . South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday , then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89 . Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs . He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings , having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2 . Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs -LRB- 19 -RRB- before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher . Boucher departed for 23 , caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie , who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs . The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp , and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory . The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis , hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday 's five-run win against England . McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent , scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel 's four victims . Morkel , who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs , then removed Ross Taylor -LRB- 1 -RRB- two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15 . He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher , and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal government is starting to deploy full-body scanning machines to 11 airports across the United States , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday . Forty body-imaging machines already have been put into use at 19 airports nationwide as part of a field test , according the Department of Homeland Security . The Transportation Security Administration expects to deploy 450 units by the end of this year . `` By accelerating the deployment of this technology , we are enhancing our capability to detect and disrupt threats of terrorism across the nation , '' Napolitano said in a statement . The first of the new units are being installed Friday at Boston 's Logan International Airport , according to a DHS statement . The list of other airports set to receive the scanners by the end of summer includes Chicago O'Hare International , Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International , Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky International , Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International , Los Angeles International , Port Columbus International , Oakland International , San Diego International , Kansas City International and Charlotte Douglas International . The imaging machines are being funded through the Obama administration 's $ 862 billion economic stimulus plan . Under existing protocols , full-body scans are optional at airport checkpoints . Travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat down and subjected to other tests such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage . The TSA said most passengers prefer a body scan to a pat down . But others have objected to the body scans , calling them electronic strip searches . Passenger privacy is maintained during the scannning process by blurring all images , deleting images after they are viewed and placing the screener viewing the images in a remote location , according to DHS officials . Acting TSA Administrator Gale Rossides testified before Congress on Thursday that the machines will not significantly slow the passenger screening process , saying it will be done at the same time as carry-on baggage screening . The TSA has spent years testing full-body imagers . Plans to deploy them this year were given added urgency after the arrest of a Nigerian man , Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , who has been accused of attempting to detonate an explosive sewn into his underwear on a December 25 flight . Field testing of full-body scanners already is under way at the following 19 airports : \u2022 Albuquerque International Sunport Airport \u2022 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \u2022 Baltimore\/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport \u2022 Denver International Airport \u2022 Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport \u2022 Detroit Metro Airport \u2022 Indianapolis International Airport \u2022 Jacksonville International Airport \u2022 McCarran International Airport \u2022 Los Angeles International Airport \u2022 Miami International Airport \u2022 Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport \u2022 Raleigh-Durham International Airport \u2022 Richmond International Airport \u2022 Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport \u2022 San Francisco International Airport \u2022 Salt Lake City International Airport \u2022 Tampa International Airport \u2022 Tulsa International Airport CNN 's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Conrad Murray , personal physician to Michael Jackson , was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the pop star 's death last summer . A criminal complaint filed earlier in the day alleged that Murray `` did unlawfully , and without malice , kill Michael Joseph Jackson . '' Murray turned himself in shortly before 4 p.m. at a branch courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport . He pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing before Judge Keith L. Schwartz . The judge set bail at $ 75,000 , despite arguments from prosecutor David Walgren that Murray is a flight risk . The judge refused to suspend Murray 's medical license as a term of his bond , but he did order him not to use any anesthesia on patients . `` I do n't want you sedating people , '' Schwartz told Murray . Read the criminal complaint The involuntary manslaughter charge means that Murray caused Jackson 's death by acting `` without due caution and circumspection . '' If convicted , Murray would face a maximum four-year prison sentence , according to prosecutors . More on involuntary manslaughter Members of Michael Jackson 's family -- including his parents Joe and Katherine Jackson , sister La Toya Jackson , and brothers Jackie , Jermaine , Randy and Tito Jackson -- attended the hearing . `` Not enough , '' Jermaine Jackson said when asked what he thought of the charge . `` I do n't like what happened , '' Joe Jackson said as he left the courthouse . La Toya Jackson later issued a statement through a publicist . `` Michael was murdered and although he died at the hands of Dr. Conrad Murray , I believe Dr. Murray was a part of a much larger plan , '' her statement said . `` There are other individuals involved and I will not rest and I will continue to fight until all of the proper individuals are brought forth and justice is served . '' Her statement did not elaborate on what she meant in her reference to `` a much larger plan . '' Murray traveled to Los Angeles at the end of January from his home in Houston , Texas , in expectation of possible charges , his lawyer said . He used part of his time last week to visit the pop star 's resting place in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , California . Murray , a cardiologist , was hired as Jackson 's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for comeback concerts in London , England . The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson at his $ 100,000-a-month rented Holmby Hills mansion through the early morning hours of June 25 , 2009 , in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep , according to a police affidavit . He administered sleep aids , and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours , Murray said , he left the bedroom for `` about two minutes maximum , '' the affidavit says . `` Upon his return , Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing , '' it says . The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him to UCLA Medical Center . Efforts at CPR proved fruitless , and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. . The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson 's death a homicide , resulting from a combination of drugs , primarily propofol and lorazepam . The coroner 's statement said Jackson died from `` acute propofol intoxication , '' but there were `` other conditions contributing to death : benzodiazepine effect . '' Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines . The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing , a police affidavit said . Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer 's death . The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol , the generic name for Diprivan , diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip . The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it . During the two nights before Jackson 's death , Murray said , he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep . The full autopsy report , which was released Monday afternoon , included an analysis by an anesthesiology consultant of the use of propofol . The consultant , Dr. Selma Calmes , concluded that the `` standard of care for administering propofol was not met . '' `` There was no evidence of an infusion pump for control of an IV infusion . No monitors were found at the scene ; a blood pressure cuff and portable pulse oximeter were recovered from a closet in the next room , '' Calmes wrote . An oxygen tank was found near where Jackson slept , but it was empty when the coroner investigator checked it two weeks after Jackson died , Calmes said . `` Multiple opened bottles of propofol were found with small amounts of remaining drugs , '' Calmes said . `` A used bottle should be discarded six hours after opening , to avoid possible bacterial growth . '' `` The level of propofol found on toxicology exam are similar to those found during general anesthesia for major surgery , '' Calmes said . During such surgery , any patient would be `` intubated and ventilated by an anesthesiologist , '' she said . The consultant 's report said that the level of lorazepam found in Jackson `` would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World Twenty20 champions Pakistan were left stunned after none of their players were signed up for the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament in Tuesday 's auction . With this year 's budget slashed from $ 2 million per team to just $ 750,000 , only 11 of the 66 international players on offer were snapped up . West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard and veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond were the biggest winners as the Mumbai Indians and the Kolkata Knight Riders respectively used their entire allocated funds to sign them for the 2010 season . But Pakistan 's Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi , one of the world 's most explosive players in the limited-overs format , failed to secure a place along with teammates highly-rated Mohammad Aamer , Umar Gul and Umar Akmal . Afridi 's manager blamed the Indian government for continuing its long-running tensions with Pakistan . `` I 'd heard prior to the auction that franchises were being advised not to bid for Pakistani players as the players from Pakistan would not be issued with visas by the Indian government , and that is precisely what has happened , '' Umar Khan told www.pakpassion.net . `` The Indian Premier League have been using Afridi 's name and pictures to publicize the tournament and to build up the hype , and he was expected to be one of the most popular players amongst the franchises . '' Big-hitting all-rounder Afridi was stunned to be left out , having played for the Deccan Chargers in 2008 but did not feature last year as the team won the title . `` I 'm stunned by the omission and , yes , I 'm obviously very disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing once again in the Indian Premier League and testing my skills against the world 's best players and against friends and colleagues , '' he said . `` I thought I would be picked and am very surprised at the outcome of the auction . '' Pollard was sought by four teams , with Mumbai heading off Kolkata , the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Chennai Super Kings after making a sealed-envelope final bid . The 22-year-old Pollard , who has played only 15 one-dayers and 10 Twenty20 internationals , takes $ 750,000 as his payment while the undisclosed extra money goes to the IPL . The 34-year-old Bond , who has retired from Test cricket to prolong his career , has been welcomed into the IPL fold despite having signed up with its unsanctioned rival Indian Cricket League , which has not been staged since 2008 . He went into the auction with a $ 100,000 reserve price tag , but both Kolkata and the Chargers bid the full amount for him . West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach went to the Chargers for $ 720,000 while Delhi Daredevils signed South Africa fast bowler Wayne Parnell for $ 610,000 -- $ 510,000 more than his reserve price . Former India batsman Mohammad Kaif was sold to the Kings XI Punjab franchise for $ 250,000 after his contract was bought out by the Rajasthan Royals , while Bangalore signed England one-day specialist Eoin Morgan for $ 220,000 . Rajasthan also snapped up former Australia batsman Damien Martyn -LRB- $ 100,000 -RRB- and his compatriot Adam Voges -LRB- $ 50,000 -RRB- , while Chennai Super Kings signed South Africa 's Justin Kemp -LRB- $ 100,000 -RRB- and Sri Lanka 's Thissara Perera -LRB- $ 50,000 -RRB- . In the only other sale , Punjab bought South Africa 's Yusuf Abdulla for $ 50,000 . Meanwhile , India reached 122-1 in their second innings at stumps on the third day of the opening Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong , having bowled out the home side for 242 . The tourists narrowly avoided conceding a first-innings deficit for the first time against cricket 's lowest-ranked Test nation , with Bangladesh falling one run short after resuming on 59-3 after bad light and fogged delayed the start of play on Tuesday . Mahmudullah scored a personal best 69 as he added 108 for the seventh wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim -LRB- 44 -RRB- , but spinner Amit Mishra cleaned up the tail to finish with three wickets to match the feat of left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan . Mishra was then unbeaten on 24 at stumps along with opener Gautam Gambhir , who made 47 after putting on 90 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag -LRB- 45 -RRB- .

{"answer":"SAN FRANCISCO , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The California Supreme Court has cleared the way for Californians to vote in November on whether to ban same-sex marriages in the state . A gay couple is married in California in June . Voters could void same-sex marriages in the state in November . The court on Wednesday denied a petition to remove the initiative from the state 's general election ballots . The unanimous decision was handed down without elaboration . Hundreds of marriage licenses have been issued to same-sex couples since mid-June , a month after the court overturned the state 's laws against such unions . However , on June 2 , opponents of same-sex marriage filed for a ballot initiative that would ban such marriages in the state 's constitution . Such a ban would overturn the court 's May ruling . Equality California , a Sacramento-based activist group , filed a petition against the initiative -- Proposition 8 -- arguing that it involves a constitutional revision that ca n't be adopted through a ballot vote . The group also contended that petitions circulated to qualify the proposition for the ballot contained material that misled readers about the measure 's effects . Jennifer Kerns , a spokeswoman for the proposition , called Wednesday 's decision `` a huge victory . '' `` We believe it deals a strong blow to our opponents and sends a strong message that they wo n't be able to keep the ballot initiative away from the people of California , '' she said . Calls Wednesday to Equality California were not immediately returned . If the proposition is approved , it would be the second time same-sex marriages have been voided in California . In February 2004 , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom -- who is considering a run for governor -- challenged the state 's laws against same-sex marriage , ordering city officials to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples . Those unions were voided by the California Supreme Court , though the justices sidestepped the issue of whether banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional , allowing legal cases to work their way through the lower courts . Several gay and lesbian couples -- along with the city of San Francisco and gay-rights groups -- sued , saying they were victims of unlawful discrimination . A lower court ruled San Francisco had acted unlawfully in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples . However , the state Supreme Court 's ruling in May struck down the state 's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional . That decision made California the nation 's second state , after Massachusetts , to legalize same-sex marriage . Four other states allow civil unions .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a column appearing in Newsweek , world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria said he thinks it would be best for Republican presidential hopeful John McCain if Gov. Sarah Palin bowed out as his vice presidential running mate . `` For him to choose Sarah Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible , '' says Zakaria . Zakaria says McCain did not put the country first in making his V.P. choice , and he says Palin is not qualified to lead the United States . CNN spoke to him about his commentary titled , `` Palin is ready ? Please . '' CNN : What did you initially think when Sarah Palin was announced as the Republican vice presidential nominee ? Zakaria : I was a bit surprised -- as I think most people were . But I was willing to give her a chance . And I thought her speech at the convention was clever and funny . But once she began answering questions about economics and foreign policy , it became clear that she has simply never thought about these subjects before and is dangerously ignorant and unprepared for the job of vice president , let alone president . Watch Zakaria slam Sarah Palin '' CNN : You do n't think she is qualified ? Zakaria : No . Gov. Palin has been given a set of talking points by campaign advisers , simple ideological mantras that she repeats and repeats as long as she can . But if forced off those rehearsed lines , what she has to say is often , quite frankly -- nonsense . Just listen to her response to Katie Couric 's question about the bailout . It 's gibberish -- an emptying out of catchphrases about economics that have nothing to do with the question or the topic . It 's scary to think that this person could be running the country . Here is their exchange : Katie Couric : Why is n't it better , Gov. Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle-class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ; allow them to spend more and put more money into the economy instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ? Gov. Sarah Palin : That 's why I say I , like every American I 'm speaking with , we 're ill about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out . But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health-care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy , helping the -- it 's got to be all about job creation , too , shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track . So health-care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for Americans . And trade , we 've got to see trade as opportunity , not as a competitive , scary thing . But one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today , we 've got to look at that as more opportunity . All those things under the umbrella of job creation . This bailout is a part of that . CNN : But Dan Quayle was n't very qualified and that did n't seem to matter , did it ? Zakaria : This is way beyond Dan Quayle . Quayle was a lightweight who was prone to scramble his words , or say things that sounded weird , but you almost always knew what he meant . One of his most famous miscues was to the United Negro College Fund when he said , `` What a terrible thing to have lost one 's mind . Or not to have a mind at all . '' Now he was trying to play off a famous ad that the group used to run , `` A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste . '' And he screwed it up in a funny way . But read Gov. Palin 's answers and it does appear that she does n't have any understanding about the topic under discussion . CNN : But she has a lot of supporters . Zakaria : Look , I 'm not saying that she is not a feisty , charismatic politician who has done some good things in Alaska . It is just we are talking about a person who should be ready to lead the United States at a moment 's notice . She has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start . CNN : Does it make you concerned about Sen. McCain as a president ? Zakaria : Yes , and I say this with sadness because I greatly admire John McCain , a man of intelligence , honor and enormous personal and political courage . However , for him to choose Sara Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible . He did not put the country first with this decision . Whether it is appropriate or not , considering Sen. McCain 's age most people expected to have a vice presidential candidate who would be ready to step in at a moment 's notice . The actuarial odds of that happening are significant , something like a one-in-five chance .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that would make suing for pay discrimination easier by altering a time limit on such suits . The act is named for Lilly Ledbetter , seen here in 2008 . Her discrimination lawsuit victory was overturned in 2007 . The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , which passed 250-177 , would give workers alleging unequal pay the right to sue within 180 days of their most recent paycheck . Current law says such employees must sue within 180 days of receiving their first unfair paycheck . Supporters of the new legislation say that , under the current law , an employer merely needs to hide unfair pay practices for three months before being able to continue them without penalty . The act , named for a former Goodyear Tire employee who sued the company for gender discrimination in 1998 , would effectively overturn a 2007 Supreme Court decision on the limit . Ledbetter was awarded $ 360,000 in back pay by a federal judge in Alabama , but the verdict was overturned in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in May 2007 . The court said that even though she filed her complaint within 180 days of when she first learned that she was getting paid less than comparable male employees , she had failed to file within 180 days of the first unequal paycheck . After Tuesday 's House vote , Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the chamber had `` taken a bold step '' in passing the legislation . `` In doing so , it has injected fairness , reason and common sense back into policy , '' Pelosi said . The legislation , which passed the Senate on Thursday , now goes to President Barack Obama , who has promised to sign it into law . It is the first major piece of legislation Congress has sent to Obama for his approval . On the campaign trail , Obama and Republican nominee Sen. John McCain debated the bill . Obama heavily emphasized what he called the plan 's benefits to working women , while McCain criticized it as a boon for trial lawyers . Pelosi said Obama called to congratulate her on the bill 's passage . Obama danced with Ledbetter at one of his inaugural balls , and she spoke at the Democrat National Convention at which he accepted his party 's nomination . `` My case is over -- I will never receive the pay I deserve , '' Ledbetter said in that speech . `` But there will be a far richer reward if we secure fair pay for our children and grandchildren , so that no one will ever again experience the discrimination that I did .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bad economy and downturn in the housing market are n't the only painful things for Realtor Anne Stephens . Her knees , hips and ankles hurt from arthritis . Anne Stephens , 61 , was in her late 30s when she was diagnosed with osteoarthritis . `` I ca n't sit too long . I ca n't stand too long , and I ca n't walk too long , '' said Stephens , 61 , from Conyers , Georgia . Stephens is among the 27 million Americans who suffer from the most common form of arthritis called osteoarthritis . `` I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance , '' said Dr. John Klippel , president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation . `` They think of it as only aches and pains and not the serious problem that it actually is -- the leading cause of disability in this country . '' Klippel said part of the misconception has to do with all the myths surrounding the disease . Common myth 1 : Arthritis is a disease of the elderly While older people do develop arthritis , children and teenagers can get certain forms of the condition , Klippel said . The Arthritis Foundation reports two-thirds of people with doctor-diagnosed arthritis are under age 65 . Watch more on arthritis fact and fiction \u00c2 '' Stephens was in her late 30s when she developed osteoarthritis after injuring her knees running and playing volleyball . She felt a sharp pain and recalled , `` It was downhill after that . '' Researchers do n't know the exact cause of arthritis , but they do know what puts people at risk . Klippel said that while the disease is associated with aging , other risk factors include heredity , joint injury , obesity and lack of fitness . Common myth 2 : Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis Despite what your grandmother told you , experts say cracking your knuckles is not a risk factor for arthritis . `` It 's annoying -- it 's certainly not good for the joints , but on the other hand , it does n't cause arthritis , '' Klippel said . Common myth 3 : Predicting the weather `` Boy , there 's a good myth , '' Klippel said with a chuckle . `` I ca n't tell you how many patients I would take care of who would say they were better than the weatherman at predicting changes in humidity . '' He said researchers have studied the claims , but concluded there is no scientific evidence to suggest arthritis flare-ups occur during bad weather . Klippel also does n't buy the argument that arthritis patients are better off if they live in a warmer climate . `` If you live in a warmer climate , you 're simply more active for more months of the year and that 's probably why people feel better , '' Klippel said . `` It probably has very little to do with the weather itself . '' Common myth 4 : Exercise aggravates arthritis Staying active actually is one of the most important ways to prevent and ease the pain of arthritis , Klippel said . It also helps with weight control . `` For people with arthritis , it hurts to exercise , '' he said . `` But over time , the post-exercise pain actually diminishes if you push through it . '' He recommended choosing joint-friendly exercises such as walking , biking or swimming . In addition to putting ice on an aching joint , Klippel suggested taking nonsteroidal , anti-inflammatory medication before or after exercising to help relieve the pain . `` People need to stay active and move their joints to keep the muscles strong and to keep the joints flexible , '' Klippel said . Common myth 5 : Nothing helps Klippel worries about arthritis patients who do n't seek medical help because they do n't think anything can be done about the pain . He said a proper diagnosis can lead to a host of possible treatments , including the latest prescription medicines for pain and rehabilitating aching joints through physical therapy . Klippel urges people not to wait until the pain is unbearable before seeing a doctor . `` If aches and pains persist for more than four weeks , that 's a time to pay attention , '' he said . Anne Stephens followed that advice and she said it has made all the difference . She manages the inflammation and pain by taking prescription medication -LRB- a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug -RRB- . She also exercises at least three days a week ; the workouts help her strengthen her muscles . And she sees her doctor several times a year . `` I 've learned to adapt , '' she said . `` I know what 's going to hurt me and what does n't . ''","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police are searching for any other alleged victims of a Sunday school teacher accused of raping and killing an 8-year-old girl from Tracy , California . Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu , who was a friend of her own daughter . `` We are asking the public if they have any indication that any of their children may have had inappropriate contact with -LSB- the suspect -RSB- to contact us , '' Tracy Police Sgt. Tony Sheneman said Tuesday evening . `` There has been no indication that this has happened . But she is a Sunday school teacher and did have contact with children , so that is why we are asking . '' Melissa Huckaby , 28 , was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu , a friend of her 5-year-old daughter . Huckaby , wearing red jail scrubs over a white T-shirt , was in court Tuesday for an arraignment . She was charged with murder , kidnapping , the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14 and rape by instrument . If convicted , Huckaby would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole , San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing . A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later , he said . Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing , although she flinched when Sandra Cantu 's name was spoken , and she cried at times . Sandra 's body was found April 6 , stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm . Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police . Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her daughter . The two children were close friends and played together frequently , police said . Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless , pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park , and she taught Sunday school at the church , police have said . The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra 's disappearance and death . Before her arrest , Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra 's body . But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen . Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case , saying evidence would be presented in court . A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy , police said . -- CNN 's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tamil Tiger rebels acknowledged the death of their leader Sunday , nearly a week after the Sri Lankan government said it had recovered the body of Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared victory in the country 's 25-year civil war with the rebels . In this picture taken 27 November 2003 , Velupillai Prabhakaran stands next to an LTTE flag . Prabhakaran `` attained martyrdom fighting the military oppression of the Sri Lankan state '' on May 17 , according to Tamilnet.com , a rebel Web site , citing the group 's international affairs spokesman . On Tuesday , President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared victory against the Tamil Tigers . `` We are celebrating the defeat of terrorism , '' he said in a nationally televised speech before parliament . `` We have won and restored democracy in the country . '' The president declared a national holiday for the following day to celebrate the war 's end and begin a new phase in the country 's history . Watch the victory parade '' A short time after the presidential address , the military announced that it had recovered the body of Prabhakaran , leader and founder of the Tamil Tigers . The rebels initially denied the death of their leader , claiming on Tamilnet.com that Prabhakaran was `` alive and safe . '' The defense ministry said the bodies of Prabhakaran and 18 other senior rebel leaders were among corpses found in mop-up operations , after government troops routed the Tigers -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . The leaders included Prabhakaran 's eldest son , Charles Anthony , as well as Pottu Amman , the Tigers ' intelligence leader , according to the ministry . Watch the U.N. chief discuss the humanitarian crisis '' Prabhakaran founded the Tamil Tigers , who have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries . It initiated the use of women in suicide attacks and , according to the FBI , invented the explosive suicide belt . Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu . Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi 's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka . Two years later , a Tigers suicide bomber , allegedly acting on Prabhakaran 's orders , detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka 's then-president , Ranasinghe Premadasa , during a rally . The rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983 . An estimated 70,000 to 80,000 people have died during the quarter century of fighting .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Baseball legend Barry Bonds is scheduled to be sentenced Friday for his obstruction of justice conviction . The hearing at 11 a.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- will take place in a San Francisco federal courtroom less than two miles from the ballpark where Bonds broke Hank Aaron 's major league home run record in August 2007 . Federal prosecutors want Bonds , 47 , to serve 15 months in prison , according to a sentencing memo filed in court earlier this month . Defense lawyers argued in their filing that the judge should accept the probation office 's recommendation that Bonds be sentenced to two years ' probation , fined $ 4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service . Jurors who found Bonds guilty in April said he was `` evasive '' in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes . `` Because Bonds 's efforts were a corrupt , intentional effort to interfere with that mission , a sentence of 15 months imprisonment is appropriate , '' the prosecution said in its memo to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston . But jurors , who were deadlocked on three perjury counts , said that it was not proven that Bonds lied when he testified that he had not knowingly used steroids . Prosecutors decided not to pursue a retrial . Prosecutors still argued in the sentencing memo that Bonds ' denial that he was `` taking steroids and human growth hormone were patently false . '' Bonds ' testimony in December 2003 was part of the investigation that targeted Bonds ' personal trainer Greg Anderson and employees of the California drug testing laboratory known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative -LRB- BALCO -RRB- . The testimony that led to Bonds ' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds if Anderson ever gave him `` anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with . '' Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors `` ever touch me , '' and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson . Defense lawyers argued that Bonds thought the creams and ointments Anderson was giving him were made of flax seed oils . Sentences for other athletes convicted in connection with the BALCO investigation have not included prison time . CNN 's Greg Morrison and Alan Duke contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"The Hague , Netherlands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors in the long-awaited war crimes trial of Radovan Karadzic said they will push ahead Tuesday , though the Bosnian Serb leader is expected to be a no-show once again . On Monday -- the opening day of the trial -- the court was forced to adjourn after Karadzic refused to appear , saying he did not have enough time to prepare . Karadzic , who is accused of masterminding the worst massacre in Europe since World War II , is representing himself . `` Obviously , it is the court 's preference for Karadzic to attend , '' said Nerma Jelacic , spokeswoman for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . `` But if he chooses not to attend , then some facility will be provided to him to allow him to watch the court 's proceedings from his prison cell . '' The court can not force a defendant to appear . Karadzic , as a `` self-representing accused , '' is the only one who can cross-examine witnesses and speak in court about the substance of the charges against him . However , judges can impose a lawyer on Karadzic if he continues to refuse to cooperate . Karadzic faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity against Bosnian Muslims , Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbian civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s . Bosnia and Herzegovina were a part of Yugoslavia at the time . The conflict introduced the phrase `` ethnic cleansing '' into the lexicon describing war crimes , as different factions in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia sought to kill or drive out other groups . Karadzic was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in Belgrade , the capital of Serbia , and practicing alternative medicine in disguise . In a letter dated Wednesday and made public Thursday , Karadzic complained to the International Criminal Tribunal that he had not received the relevant case material on time . He also said there was too much material to go through , even had he received it promptly . `` I ask Your Excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages , only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest ? '' he wrote . `` Why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date ? '' He promised to continue his preparations in `` the most intensive way '' and inform the court when he is ready . The genocide charges against Karadzic stem partly from killings in Srebrenica , the most notorious massacre of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Memories of the massacre remain raw . Watch the video Prosecutors at the U.N. war crimes tribunal accuse Karadzic of responsibility . `` On 8 March 1995 , Karadzic instructed Bosnian Serb forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of Srebrenica , amongst other places , '' the tribunal said in a statement this month . The Hague indictment also said Karadzic committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-Serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen Bosnian municipalities early in the war . Karadzic , who faces life in prison if he is convicted , denies the charges . The court can not impose the death penalty . The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations . Karadzic was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office . Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague .","question":""}
{"answer":"Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States plans to appeal a federal judge 's dismissal of charges against five Blackwater security guards accused of killing 17 people in Baghdad in 2007 , Vice President Joe Biden announced Saturday . Speaking at a joint appearance with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in Baghdad , Biden said he was `` disappointed '' with the ruling , and that the Justice Department would file the appeal next week . `` The United States is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people , '' Biden told reporters . The September 2007 shootout in Baghdad 's Nusoor Square left 17 Iraqis dead and two dozen wounded . The killings led Iraq 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater , now known as Xe , and other firms . An attorney representing one of the five defendants in the case said he was disappointed by Biden 's announcement in Iraq , saying it was motivated by `` political purposes '' as opposed to legal reasoning . `` This is not how the Justice Department announces its intentions in any case , '' said David Schertler , attorney for Dustin Heard . `` We had no idea that the vice president was going to announce a political decision . '' Last month , U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the government 's case was built largely on `` statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution , '' a violation of the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged . `` In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , '' Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision . Federal prosecutors `` repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case '' in doing so , he found . Urbina also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case , calling their explanations for using the guards ' statements `` all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility . '' `` In short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , '' he wrote . Schertler , Heard 's attorney , said Urbina 's `` reasoning is sound and will hold up in appeal . '' The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began . The company said its contractors came under attack , but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate . Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough , Evan Liberty , Dustin Heard , Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime . Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November , but Thursday 's ruling dismisses the counts against all five . `` We 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , '' Slough 's lawyer , Mark Hulkower , said at the time of the dismissal . A sixth guard , Jeremy Ridgeway , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter . CNN 's Dan Lothian and Samira Simone contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the election of the next president a year away , Sen. Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat , a CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests . As the countdown begins to November 4 , 2008 , the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani . But Clinton 's path to the White House is in no way certain . Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week , and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq , Iran and other major issues . The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner , with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton . The attacks may be working . The CNN\/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton 's support has slipped from its height one month ago . Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers '' `` Clinton 's strength is about where it was throughout the summer , indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency , '' CNN political director Keating Holland said . Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll . Her closest rival , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , was the top choice of 25 percent , and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent . All other Democratic candidates were in single digits . New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent , Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent , Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent . The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic . The poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . View the poll results '' In an October CNN\/Opinion Research poll , Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama . During last week 's Democratic debate , Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals , who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January . Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate , criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq , Iran and Social Security . `` The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and wo n't say one thing one time and something different at a different time , '' Edwards said . Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a `` corporate Democrat '' too willing to defend a `` corrupt '' Washington establishement . `` We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that 's become broken , corruption has crept into it , and we have to tell the truth about that , '' Edwards said Monday . `` If you defend that system , I do n't believe you can bring about the change that America needs . '' In the Republican presidential race , Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate , with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled . Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent . Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent . Of the remaining Republican candidates , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent , Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent , California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent . The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican . The poll 's margin of error was 5 percentage points . In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners , Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent . That lead has increased since October , when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent . `` The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats , partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood , which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party , '' Holland said . Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well , while 58 percent think things are going badly , the poll found . `` The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry , '' Holland said . `` More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country . '' Clinton 's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances , the poll found . In a three-way race , Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters , Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent . The poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent . `` My analysis of it is that -LSB- a third-party candidate -RSB- is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me , '' Giuliani said . `` You know it is a tactic , and a legitimate one . People have to think about that and consider it . '' The lack of enthusiasm for Giuliani , particularly by social conservatives , could spell trouble for the GOP next year if he becomes the nominee , Holland said . `` Only 27 percent of Republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if Giuliani won the GOP nod , and the remaining GOP candidates fare even worse , '' he said .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six heat-trapping gases that contribute to air pollution pose potential health hazards , the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday in a landmark announcement that could lead to regulation of the gases . `` This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem , '' EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said . The gases -- carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world , the EPA said . The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA 's scientific review in 2007 . `` This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations , '' EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in a release , later adding , `` The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions , and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate . '' The EPA 's finding now goes into a public comment period . The report , titled `` Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality : A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone , '' is the culmination of a study started in 2000 , the EPA said . The White House moved quickly to try to squelch any concerns that the EPA would immediately issue any regulations concerning the gases . `` The president has made clear his strong preference that Congress act to pass comprehensive legislation rather than address the climate challenge through administrative action , '' White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said . `` That 's why the president has repeatedly called for a bill to provide for market-based solutions to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a clean-energy economy that creates millions of green jobs . '' The EPA announcement comes amid efforts by Congress to enact a limit on global warming pollution . The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin hearings next week on a comprehensive energy and climate bill , called the American Clean Energy and Security Act . Committee Chairman Henry Waxman is said to want the bill out of committee by Memorial Day , which falls on May 25 , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants to bring the bill to the House floor for a vote this year . Environmentalists hailed the EPA 's announcement , with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund calling it a `` historic step ... -LSB- that -RSB- formally determined that global warming pollution ` endangers ' the nation 's human health and well-being . '' `` The U.S. is taking its first steps as a nation to confront climate change , '' said Vickie Patton , deputy general counsel at the environmental advocacy group . `` Global warming threatens our health , our economy , and our children 's prosperity . EPA 's action is a wake-up call for national policy solutions that secure our economic and environmental future . '' But critics say the finding will just produce a `` glorious mess . '' `` Today 's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs , raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America 's global competitiveness , '' said Sen. James Inhofe , R-Oklahoma , the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee . `` It now appears EPA 's regulatory reach will find its way into schools , hospitals , assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act . '' The EPA notes in an accompanying report released Friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the United States . Future ozone management decisions may have to take into account the possible effects of global warming , the report says . `` Climate change , along with other aspects of global change , including changes in population , land use and the technologies employed for energy production and transportation , may alter the capacity for U.S. states to successfully attain the national air quality standards in the future , '' the report concludes . Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight causes a chemical reaction in the air between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by motor vehicles and industrial plants . Ozone levels are typically higher on sunny days in areas that have many vehicles or smoke-stack industries . Global warming also could increase the number of days with weather conditions conducive to forming ozone , potentially causing air quality alerts earlier in the spring and later in the fall , the report says . In addition to health problems , the report says global warming could lead to increased drought , more heavy downpours and flooding , and more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires . Global warming could also cause a greater rise in sea level , more intense storms and harm to water resources , agriculture , wildlife and ecosystems , the report said .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Events commemorating the bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie were taking place Sunday in both the UK and the U.S. to mark the 20th anniversary of the attack which killed 270 people . Mourners gathered at a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday to mark the Lockerbie bombing . All 259 people on board Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York were killed when the plane exploded in midair on December 21 , 1988 . A further 11 people died on the ground as debris rained down on Lockerbie . In Scotland , mourners watched as a commemorative wreath was laid at Dryfesdale Cemetery , the site of a permanent memorial and remembrance garden to the victims of the attack . Canon Michael Bands , who led the service , said that the disaster had `` long ceased to be a Lockerbie event and become a world event . '' `` It is awful that we should gather today on this stormy sort of day to feel the sadness again of the tragedy that took place here 20 years ago , '' Bands said , according to the UK 's Press Association . Services marking the exact time of the attack at 1903 GMT were also due to take place later in local churches . A private service for relatives of victims and former Pan Am employees will also take place at London 's Heathrow airport , where the airliner began its final flight . In the U.S. , remembrance services were scheduled to take place at Arlington National Cemetery and at New York 's Syracuse University , which lost 35 students in the bombing . Scotland 's First Minister Alex Salmond said the anniversary marked an opportunity to reflect on `` the lasting links that have been established with those in other nations who were touched by the disaster . '' `` I know that through the events being organised in Lockerbie , at Syracuse University , and at other locations in the UK and the U.S. , that fitting tribute will be paid to those who so tragically lost their lives and those , in the south of Scotland and beyond , whose lives have been affected by the atrocity . '' A former Libyan intelligence officer , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi , was convicted of the bombing in 2001 . Al Megrahi , who is serving a life sentence in Scotland 's Greenock Prison , last month lost an appeal to be released because he is suffering from advanced prostate cancer . Al Megrahi has always denied any involvement in the bombing . He was convicted after prosecutors argued he had placed the bomb , hidden in a suitcase , on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt , Germany . There , prosecutors said , the bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am jet that went first to London 's Heathrow Airport and then was to continue to New York . The prosecution maintained that Megrahi , who worked at Malta 's Luqa Airport , was an agent for the Libyan intelligence services and had been seen buying clothes that were in the suitcase that contained the bomb . In 2007 Scottish judges granted Megrahi the right to make a second appeal against his conviction on grounds that he may have suffered a miscarriage of justice . That process is ongoing . Another man -- Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima -- was also tried in the bombing but was acquitted . Libya has formally accepted responsibility for the bombing , though Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi later denied any culpability . The north African country has paid out more than $ 500 million to the families of victims of the attack as part of a wider $ 1.5 billion settlement to end its legal liability in U.S. terrorism cases and restore diplomatic full relations with Washington .","question":""}

Phillip Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy , 54 , are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard , who was 11 when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe , California . The couple has pleaded not guilty . The hearing , scheduled for 1 p.m. -LRB- 4 p.m. ET -RRB- at the El Dorado County Superior Court , is a procedural matter about witnesses in the case .

She was 29 when she was found in August at the Garridos ' home in Antioch about 120 miles from her house . Garrido , a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest , is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity . Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother , Terry Probyn , and Dugard 's two daughters . Earlier this month , Judge Douglas Phimister denied a request by the Garridos to be able to see each other while they remain jailed . Instead , the judge ruled , the couple can have one five-minute phone conversation this month and in June . He also said that officials can monitor the calls . The judge did not offer a reason for denying the request . The prosecution had opposed the motion on security grounds . Authorities maintain Dugard does not want to speak to Garrido or his attorneys and have tried to keep her location a secret . In March , Dugard made her first public statement since the arrests of her alleged captors . `` Hi , I 'm Jaycee .

In the Electoral College standings , the most recent survey shows 243 electoral votes either safely in Obama 's column or leaning his way . At this point , McCain can claim only 189 . Many of the state polls used to determine the Electoral College standings , however , were conducted before the conventions . Monday marked the first time McCain passed Obama in CNN 's poll of polls . Watch how the race has tightened '' On Saturday , Obama was up by 3 in the poll of polls . That lead shrank to just 1 point Sunday before disappearing Monday . In the most recent survey , 8 percent of respondents said they were still unsure about who they were going to vote for . The poll of polls is an average of five surveys : CNN -LRB- September 5-7 -RRB- , ABC\/Washington Post -LRB- September 5-7 -RRB- , CBS -LRB- September 5-7 -RRB- , Gallup -LRB- September 5-7 -RRB- and Diageo\/Hotline -LRB- September 5-7 -RRB- . The poll of polls does not have a sampling error . The CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Monday shows McCain and Obama tied at 48 percent . The poll , which was conducted Friday through Sunday , carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . It was based on 1,022 telephone interviews . Republicans are hoping that if McCain can close the popular vote gap , he can also make gains in the electoral gap . The Electoral College will ultimately decide who takes over the White House . Watch what the different standings mean '' Although polls across the country are open on one day , the election is not a national poll but a series of 51 state-level elections that decide the members of the Electoral College . Technically , voters are n't choosing a candidate but a slate of electors who have pledged to vote for that candidate when the Electoral College meets . With 538 electors up for grabs , the candidate with more than half -- 270 -- wins the presidency . The number of electors from each state equals the number of senators and representatives the state sends to Congress Both candidates are turning their focus to battleground areas as they try to stack the states in their column . According to CNN 's electoral map , the states that could go either way are Colorado , Florida , Michigan , Missouri , New Hampshire , Nevada , Ohio and Virginia . McCain and his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , are campaigning Tuesday in Lebanon , Ohio , just 30 miles from Obama , who is in Riverside . No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio . Obama 's running mate , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , is campaigning in Missouri . Both parties are putting a lot of emphasis on Missouri . For the past century , the state has voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election except one . -LRB- Missouri picked Adlai Stevenson over Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 . -RRB- McCain and Palin campaigned there Monday .

'' In a statement at the White House , Obama urged Sri Lankan government troops to halt the `` indiscriminate '' shelling of civilians trapped with the remnants of the country 's Tamil Tiger rebels and demanded the rebels stop using civilians as `` human shields . '' Security Council members issued a statement demanding `` that all parties respect their obligations under international humanitarian law . '' Though the rebels once controlled much of northeastern Sri Lanka , government troops have forced them from all but a small portion of the island since November . The remaining rebel force is pinned down on a narrow strip on the island 's northern coast , but more than 50,000 civilians are trapped there as well , the United Nations estimates . Anna Neistat , of the New York-based Human Rights Watch , told CNN that both sides in the conflict are guilty of `` egregious violations '' of humanitarian law . `` I think the government claims that they 're not using heavy weapons do not pass the laugh test any more , '' she said . `` Witnesses are telling us about the shelling . We also get photos of remnants of the shells that hit the areas . '' U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss told CNN on Monday that hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting because the Sri Lankan army had put residents in the crossfire , and Obama and the Security Council urged the government to live up to its commitment to stop using heavy weapons . Neistat said at least 30 hospitals had been attacked in the conflict zone as well . Meanwhile , the Tigers -- who have been branded a terrorist organization by the United States , more than 30 other countries and the European Union -- are refusing to let the civilians who surround them evacuate , Neistat said . `` Witnesses are telling us that they were not allowed to leave , that those who tried to leave were shot at by the Tamil Tigers , '' she said . The group , formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , have fought for an independent state in Sri Lanka since 1983 . As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began , and nearly 200,000 people are now sheltering in camps across the country 's north . Obama called on the remaining rebels `` to lay down their arms and let civilians go . '' `` Their forced recruitment of civilians and their use of civilians as human shields is deplorable . These tactics will only serve to alienate all those who carry them out , '' he said . Obama also said government troops `` should stop the indiscriminate shelling that has taken hundreds of innocent lives '' in recent days . A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka -- the third aid worker killed in six weeks -- the International Committee of the Red Cross said . The fighting between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers has intensified in the conflict area to the point that the Red Cross can not get food to that area or help the sick and wounded , said Sarasi Wijeratne , a Red Cross spokeswoman . `` Without urgent action , this humanitarian crisis could turn into a catastrophe , '' Obama said . `` Now 's the time , I believe , to put aside some of the political issues that are involved and to put the lives of the men and women and children who are innocently caught in the crossfire , to put them first .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old , the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births . A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul , Afghanistan , in October 2007 . The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases . Each year , 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb , the organization said . More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia . `` Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally , physically and financially on families , medical systems and economies , '' March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement . `` In the United States alone , the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $ 26 billion . '' The March of Dimes report , which used data collected by the World Health Organization , breaks down premature birth rates by continent . The highest premature birth rate is in Africa , where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm , with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually . In populous Asia , although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent , the number of premature births is higher , at nearly 7 million a year . While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year , its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa , at 10.6 percent of all births , according to the report . The rate is the world 's second highest . In the United States , the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years , with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase , the organization found . Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births . `` Wherever trend data are available , rates of preterm birth are increasing , '' the report said . Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks , including the possible development of cerebral palsy , blindness , hearing loss , learning disabilities and other chronic conditions , according to the March of Dimes . `` Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers , researchers , health care providers , the media , donor organizations and other stakeholders , '' the report said . `` The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial\/ethnic lines in many high-income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve , '' it added . The March of Dimes , a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research , said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers , including diabetes , high blood pressure , nutrition , body weight and tobacco and alcohol use . Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another . While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births , doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor , said Christopher Howson , vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes . `` While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low-resource settings , we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies , '' Howson said .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq is raking in more money from oil exports than it is spending , amassing a projected four-year budget surplus of up to $ 80 billion , U.S. auditors reported Tuesday . Oil accounted for 94 percent of the Iraq 's revenue from 2005 to 2007 , a U.S. report says . Leading members of Congress , noting that Washington is paying for reconstruction in Iraq , expressed outrage at the assessment . One called the findings `` inexcusable . '' `` We should not be paying for Iraqi projects while Iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank , including outrageous profits from $ 4-a-gallon gas prices in the U.S. , '' said Sen. Carl Levin , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . `` We should require that U.S. taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects . '' Baghdad had a $ 29 billion budget surplus between 2005 to 2007 . With the price of crude roughly doubling in the past year , Iraq 's surplus for 2008 is expected to run between $ 38 billion and $ 50 billion , according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office . The United States has put about $ 48 billion toward reconstruction since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , auditors reported . About $ 23 billion of that was spent on the oil and electricity industries , water systems and security . Iraq spent $ 3.9 billion on those sectors from 2005 through April 2008 , according to the GAO , the investigative arm of Congress . The ongoing fighting there , a shortage of trained staff and weak controls have made it difficult for the Iraqi government to spend its surplus on needed projects , the agency 's report concluded . Levin , a Michigan Democrat , has been an outspoken critic of the slow progress of reconstruction and an advocate of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq . His criticism Tuesday was echoed by Sen. John Warner , a Virginia Republican who is the former chairman and now a leading member of Levin 's committee . `` Despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years , U.S. taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of Iraq reconstruction funds , '' Warner said in a joint statement with Levin . `` It is time for the sovereign government of Iraq , using its revenues , expenditures and surpluses , to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people . '' In its written response to the audit report , the Treasury Department said U.S. officials are working with Iraqis to address the issue , `` and we believe progress is being made . '' `` The report shows Iraq 's budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 , but it is equally important to realize that spending in Iraq is also increasing , '' Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Andy Baukol wrote to the GAO . Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki 's government submitted a $ 22 billion supplemental budget to the Iraqi parliament in July , including $ 8 billion in proposed capital expenditures , Baukol wrote . The issue raised the hackles of several members of Congress earlier this year -- particularly because Bush administration officials said on the eve of the war that Iraqi oil money would pay for reconstruction . In 2003 , then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told the House Appropriations Committee : `` We 're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction , and relatively soon . '' Rep. Henry Waxman , D-California , said Tuesday 's report `` is going to make a lot of American families very angry . '' `` The record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for Iraq , but the Iraqi government is n't spending the money on rebuilding , '' said Waxman , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . Levin spokeswoman Tara Andringa said the senator hopes to tighten rules governing U.S. expenditures on Iraqi reconstruction efforts in the next Pentagon authorization bill . The Iraqi surplus has piled up even though the country 's oil production has only recently matched prewar levels , according to the Brookings Institution 's latest Iraq Index . The country spent about 80 percent of its $ 29 billion operating budget in 2007 , including public services and salaries , but only 28 percent of its $ 12 billion investment budget , the GAO found . The export of crude oil accounted for 94 percent of Iraq 's revenues from 2005 to 2007 , the GAO reported .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States is expelling the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States in response to a similar move by Venezuela , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday . `` We have informed the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States that he will be expelled and should leave the United States , '' McCormack said . Separately , the U.S. Treasury Department accused Friday two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials -- Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios and Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva -- and one former official -- Ramon Rodriguez Chacin -- of assisting leftist rebels in the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , with narcotics trafficking . `` Today 's designation exposes two senior Venezuelan government officials and one former official who armed , abetted and funded the FARC , even as it terrorized and kidnapped innocents , '' said Adam J. Szubin , director of the Treasury 's Office of Foreign Assets Control , in a statement . The action freezes assets the three men may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans from conducting business with them . The U.S. decision to expel the Venezuelan ambassador , Bernardo Alvarez Herrera , is the latest move in an escalating diplomatic battle that pits the United States against two of Latin America 's leftist leaders . It comes a day after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he was expelling the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela , Patrick Duddy . Chavez also said he was recalling the Venezuelan ambassador from the United States . `` He has 72 hours , from this moment , the Yankee ambassador in Caracas , to leave Venezuela , '' Chavez told a crowd of supporters . `` When there 's a new government in the United States , we 'll send an ambassador . A government that respects Latin America . '' The president said he was making the moves `` in solidarity with Bolivia and the people of Bolivia . '' Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday accused the United States of fomenting a coup d'etat by rich eastern department landowners against him , and he called for the U.S. ambassador to leave for allegedly encouraging those protesters . For the past two weeks , the demonstrators in the country 's richer eastern lowlands have been protesting Morales ' plans to redistribute the country 's natural gas revenues . `` Without fear of anyone , without fear of the empire , today before you , before the Bolivian people , I declare the ambassador of the United States persona non grata , '' Morales said Wednesday of Ambassador Philip Goldberg in a nationally televised speech . The United States called the allegations baseless and kicked out the Bolivian ambassador Thursday . The Bolivians `` made it very clear what their intention was and we took them at their word , '' McCormack said Friday . `` We take President Chavez at his word in this particular case , and we have reacted appropriately . '' Before expelling the U.S. diplomat from his country , Chavez also said Thursday that he had uncovered a U.S.-backed plot to remove him from power . `` It 's the empire that 's behind this , '' he told supporters in a televised address . `` They go around looking for a way to stop our revolution and , with it , to strike all the processes of change that are occurring in our Americas , in the Caribbean , in Central America . '' Chavez then played a four-minute tape of what he said were conversations among current and retired members of the Venezuelan military discussing whom they could count on to support a movement against the presidential palace . He said also that the presence of two Russian warplanes on Venezuelan soil for a training exercise `` is a warning '' to the rest of the world that Venezuela 's allies include Russia .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama said in an interview aired Sunday that the hardest decision he 's made since taking office was to send more troops to Afghanistan . In a `` 60 Minutes '' interview , President Obama said , `` I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney . '' Also in the interview on CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' Obama defended his decision to shut down the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and he countered criticism from former vice president Dick Cheney . `` I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney -- not surprisingly , '' Obama said . `` I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we ca n't reconcile our core values , our Constitution , our belief that we do n't torture , with our national security interests . I think he 's drawing the wrong lesson from history . '' Obama was responding to comments Cheney made to CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on March 15 , when he said the president is making the nation less safe by closing the Guantanamo prison and ending interrogation practices that Bush administration critics consider torture for terror suspects . Just a month into office , Obama ordered 17,000 troops to Afghanistan , the original front in the `` war on terrorism '' sparked by the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . `` I think it 's the right thing to do . But it 's a weighty decision because we actually had to make the decision prior to the completion of the strategic review that we were conducting , '' Obama said . Coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of AIG , Obama said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation . Obama joked that even if Geithner were to tender his resignation , the president would tell him , `` Sorry buddy , you 've still got the job . '' Geithner has come under fire over the $ 165 million in bonuses AIG paid its top executives after the insurance giant received more than $ 170 billion in federal bailout money . A loophole in the recently approved economic stimulus bill , included at the behest of the Treasury , allowed AIG to pay the bonuses . `` It 's going to take a little bit more time than we would like to make sure that we get this plan just right , '' Obama said . The president also stressed that his administration wo n't endorse a House bill that would levy a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that receive bailout money . `` As a general proposition , you do n't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals , '' Obama said . `` You want to pass laws that have some broad applicability ... you certainly do n't want to use the tax code to punish people .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques -- including forced nudity and waterboarding -- on suspected terrorists , despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys , according to a Senate report released Tuesday . The Senate report focuses on the authorization to use aggressive techniques to interrogate detainees . `` The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees , '' said the report , which reveals new details about prisoner treatment at U.S. military prisons in Cuba , Afghanistan and Iraq . `` Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority , '' the report said . The full report on the Senate Armed Services Committee investigation was declassified Tuesday by the Defense Department , less than a week after the Obama administration released several Bush-era memos detailing the use of such techniques . `` In my judgment , the report represents a condemnation of both the Bush administration 's interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse ... to low-ranking soldiers , '' Sen. Carl Levin , D-Michigan , chairman of the Senate committee , said Tuesday . `` Claims , such as that made by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the unauthorized acts of a ` few bad apples , ' were simply false . '' The Senate report said that in December 2001 the Defense Department 's General Counsel 's Office solicited information on the `` exploitation '' of detainees from the federal agency charged with training U.S. troops on how to withstand enemy interrogation techniques considered illegal by the Geneva Conventions . The inquiry to that agency , the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency , was submitted more than a month before then-President George Bush signed a memo stating that U.S. military personnel `` shall continue to treat detainees humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of the Geneva Conventions . '' The Senate committee 's investigation was largely focused on the influence of a Joint Personnel program called `` Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape . '' The program is used to train U.S. soldiers how to resist enemy interrogation , and employs harsh techniques such as forced nudity , use of fear , sleep deprivation and -- until last year -- waterboarding . The Senate report said Bush administration officials green lighted the use of Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape techniques on detainees -- despite warnings from military psychologists against doing so . The report includes an e-mail from an Army psychologist . '' -LSB- T -RSB- he use of physical pressures brings with it a large number of potential negative side effects ... If individuals are put under enough discomfort , i.e. pain , they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain , '' said Lt. Col. Morgan Banks , the senior Army Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape psychologist , in an October 2 , 2002 , e-mail to personnel at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Levin said the program is supposed to prepare troops in the event they are captured and subjected to abusive interrogations , and that it was `` never intended to be used in the interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody . '' In a section titled , `` The Department of Justice Changes the Rules , '' the Senate report noted that less than a week after the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency sent the Defense Department information about the interrogation techniques , the Justice Department issued two legal opinions signed by then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee . The first opinion `` presented a narrow interpretation of what constituted torture under U.S. law , '' the report said . The memo said that to constitute torture , physical pain would have to match the intensity of that accompanying `` serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily functions or even death . '' The opinion said the administration could defend itself against the federal anti-torture statute by arguing necessity or self-defense . The second opinion concerned the interrogation of a specific detainee , al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydeh , and concluded that 10 different techniques -- including sleep deprivation and waterboarding -- did not violate prohibitions against torture . Last week , the Obama administration released the second Bybee opinion -- which the Senate committee did not have access to during the investigation -- and three others written by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury in May 2005 . Bradbury 's opinions concern hypothetical situations with the same interrogation techniques , as well as some others not mentioned in the 2002 memo . Those memos also conclude , for varying reasons , that the techniques did not violate prohibitions against torture . The Senate report reveals new information about Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape use on accused enemy combatants held at Guantanamo -- which President Obama plans to close within a year . `` By early October -LSB- 2002 -RSB- there was increasing pressure to get ` tougher ' with detainee interrogations '' at Guantanamo , according to testimony cited in the Senate report from a military behavioral scientist , Maj. Paul Burney , who worked with interrogators at the facility in Cuba . So , Burney and a colleague drafted a memo proposing aggressive interrogation techniques at the facility . The scientist testified that Guantanamo 's intelligence chief told him the memo needed to contain coercive techniques or it `` was n't going to get very far , '' the report said . Levin said that despite `` serious legal concerns raised by the military service lawyers , '' Defense Department General Counsel Jim Haynes recommended that then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approve 15 of the interrogation techniques -- including stress positions , removal of clothing , use of phobias -LRB- such as fear of dogs -RRB- and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli . After Rumsfeld 's December 2 , 2002 , approval , senior Guantanamo staff issued a memo on the use of aggressive techniques , saying , `` The premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at U.S. military SERE schools are appropriate for use in real-world interrogations , '' according to the report . The report details how Rumsfeld 's approval prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques . Military officials essentially copied and pasted interrogation policies from Guantanamo , and posted them as their own in Afghanistan and , ultimately , Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . In September 2003 , U.S. Central Command lawyers raised concerns about the interrogation techniques authorized for Abu Ghraib , which included stress positions , sleep deprivation and exploiting fears of dogs , the report said . The report reveals a newly declassified September 16 , 2003 , e-mail from a CentCom lawyer , Maj. Carrie Ricci , who warned that `` Many of the techniques appear to violate -LSB- Geneva Conventions -RSB- III and IV and should not be used . ... '' Dozens of military personnel who served at Abu Ghraib confirmed that the interrogation techniques cleared by Rumsfeld had made their way to the prison , according to the Senate report . An Army dog handler at Abu Ghraib told military investigators in February 2004 that `` someone from -LSB- military intelligence -RSB- gave me a list of cells , for me to go see , and pretty much have my dog bark at them . ... Having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically breaking them down for interrogation purposes . '' The Senate report said that an interrogator told military investigators in May 2004 that it was `` common to see detainees in cells without clothes or naked '' and said it was `` one of our approaches . '' Levin noted that , despite the revelation of widespread use of aggressive and abusive interrogation techniques , there is still the question of whether the senior officials who approved the policies should be held accountable . Obama on Tuesday left open the possibility of criminal prosecution , saying it would be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether to prosecute the former officials . `` With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , I would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws and I do n't want to prejudge that , '' Obama told reporters . `` There 's a host of very complicated issues involved there . As a general deal , I think we should be looking forward and not backwards . I do worry about this getting so politicized that we can not function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- House Democrats unveiled their revised version of health care reform Tuesday , offering a proposal that includes a government-funded health insurance option , requires both individuals and employers to participate , and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs . President Obama has urged Congress to work quickly on creating a health care reform bill . Democratic House leaders said the measure , titled `` America 's Affordable Health Choices Act , '' met the requirements set by President Obama for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses , letting people keep their current plan if desired , and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions . `` The House proposal will begin the process of fixing what 's broken about our health care system , reducing costs for all , building on what works , and covering an estimated 97 percent of all Americans , '' Obama said in a written statement . `` And by emphasizing prevention and wellness , it will also help improve the quality of health care for every American . '' Rep. Henry Waxman , D-California , said the bill is intended to repair a `` dysfunctional '' health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance . `` We are going to accomplish what many people felt would n't happen in our lifetime , '' he said . But House Republicans slammed the Democrats ' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three House committees begin considering the legislation later this week . Rep. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri , said the bill `` without any question will kill jobs , will limit access to health care , will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care . '' Blunt said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials , including Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , to enroll in the new public insurance option . Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats also question the cost of health care reform . An earlier draft of the House Democrats ' bill carried a price tag of $ 1 trillion over 10 years . The Congressional Budget Office said the revised house bill also would cost $ 1 trillion . However , a senior Democratic House committee staffer said the CBO analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost-saving measures worth $ 500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy Americans , estimated to raise more than $ 500 billion over a decade . According to the CBO , the bill would cover 97 percent of Americans by 2015 . The bill includes tax surcharges on Americans in the top 1.2 percent of income . It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $ 1 million , a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million , and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $ 350,000 or individual income over $ 280,000 . Anticipating Republican complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal , Democratic sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners . Specific provisions of the bill include : -- A Health Insurance Exchange providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage , including a government-funded public option . -- No more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions . -- Affordability credits for low - and moderate-income individuals and families , available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 43,000 for individuals and $ 88,000 for a family of four . -- Limits on annual out-of-pocket spending . -- Expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level . -- Required participation by individuals , with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance . -- Requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $ 250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf . -- A series of measures intended to reduce costs of Medicaid , Medicare and other existing systems . A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups opposed some of the bill 's proposals , calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses . `` Exempting some micro-businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs , '' the statement said . The House bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber . The Senate also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the House bill provisions . Obama has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before Congress goes on its August recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year . House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia argued that the current economic conditions mean Congress should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system . `` There 's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of , really , millions of jobs , '' Cantor said Tuesday . A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support Obama 's health care plans , but most worry that their costs would go up , and only one in five think their families would be better off .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities believe that a registered sex offender who this month admitted killing two California teenagers attempted to follow an 11-year-old girl walking home from school the day before one of the teens disappeared , according to documents filed in the case . John Albert Gardner , 31 , pleaded guilty April 16 to killing Chelsea King , 17 , and Amber Dubois , 14 . He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assault with intent to commit rape in a December incident involving a third woman . King was last seen leaving Poway High School in suburban San Diego , California , on February 25 . Her car , with her cell phone inside , was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park . King was known to run on the park 's trails . Her disappearance triggered a massive search that ended a few days later , when King 's remains were found in the park . Dubois disappeared in February 2009 while walking to school in Escondido , California . She was considered a missing person for more than a year until her remains were found in March . Prosecutors said Gardner led police to Dubois ' body after being assured that it would not be used against him in court . Gardner avoided the death penalty with his guilty plea but will be sentenced June 1 to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole , under terms of the plea deal with prosecutors . On February 24 , a day before King went missing , an 11-year-old girl reported that she was walking home from school when she heard a vehicle slowly approaching her from behind , according to an affidavit requesting a police search of Gardner 's home , posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTLA-TV . The documents were unsealed Monday , KTLA reported . The girl told police the vehicle drove past her and then parked about 30 feet in front of her , the documents said . The driver stayed in the vehicle , the girl said , and did not attempt to speak to her . But a woman pulled up next to the girl and told her the person in the vehicle `` seemed very suspicious '' and offered to follow her home , according to the affidavit . The man , who was in a black car , then made a U-turn and left , and the woman followed the girl the remaining two blocks to her house , the documents said . The girl 's mother called police after her daughter told her what happened . The girl 's mother told authorities that after seeing a photo of Gardner following his arrest in the King case , her daughter said Gardner was `` the guy in the car , '' the affidavit said . Gardner 's girlfriend drives a black 2002 Nissan Sentra , according to the documents . The documents also detail the December assault on the third woman near where King 's car was found at the park . She told authorities she was on a hiking trail and a man walked past her , the affidavit said . She told him , `` Good morning , '' and he returned the greeting , but then tackled her from the side as he passed her , knocking her to the ground on her back . The man pinned her to the ground , and she screamed while struggling with him , the affidavit said . He told her to `` shut up , '' and she said , `` You 're going to have to kill me . '' `` That can be arranged , '' he responded . The man then demanded money from her , the affidavit said . She was able to sit up and used her elbow to strike him in the nose , telling police she felt `` the crunch of cartilage . '' The man let go of her and grabbed his nose , she said , and she ran . A woman also told police that she saw Gardner on the jogging trails near the park on the day King disappeared , the affidavit said . She said he was sitting and drinking a beer and had several empty beer cans around him . He warned her about a rattlesnake that was nearby , and they spoke briefly . The woman said she ran past the man and then talked to him some more on her return trip . The man was wearing blue jeans and a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt , she said , according to the affidavit . A second woman also recalled seeing a man in the Hard Rock Cafe shirt on a trail that day about 3 p.m. , about an hour and a half after the first woman said she saw him , the affidavit said . The same woman believes she saw King on the trail as well . Both women told police they were 100 percent sure the man they saw was Gardner , the affidavit said . The area where the second woman recalled seeing Gardner was `` 300 yards from where the panties of Chelsea King were found and about a mile from where the body of Chelsea King was found , '' the affidavit said . At the time of his arrest , Gardner was a registered sex offender . In 2000 he was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and a count of false imprisonment , according to a probation officer 's report . The victim in that case was a 13-year-old girl , who was molested and beaten when she tried to resist , the report said . `` The defendant ... manifests marked predatory traits and is not seen as a suitable candidate for sex offender treatment insofar as he refuses to accept any responsibility for what he has done , '' according to the 2000 report . Gardner knew the girl and was a former neighbor of hers , the report said . `` The fact that he would try to force himself on her sexually is indefensible but then to beat her as he did out of frustration ... represents a qualitative leap to extremely serious criminal behavior . '' The report recommended that Gardner be sentenced to six years in prison . KTLA reported that he served five years before being paroled .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Farrah Fawcett has been hospitalized in the latest stage of her battle against cancer , a producer working with the actress said Monday . Farrah Fawcett , shown here in 2004 , was first diagnosed with cancer in 2006 . `` She is not unconscious , she is not unresponsive , and she is not comatose , '' Craig Nevius told CNN . He added that Fawcett `` is surrounded by family and friends . '' She `` has a real iron will '' and is `` a fighter , '' he said . Nevius has been working with the 62-year-old on a documentary about her fight with cancer . Earlier , he told People magazine that Fawcett had checked into `` a Los Angeles hospital . '' Fawcett was diagnosed in 2006 . People magazine reported that she has anal cancer . Early in 2007 , Fawcett said she was told her cancer had gone into remission . Her official Web site has posts from February , 2007 celebrating the news . But the cancer returned later that year . Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts and commercials , and as `` Six Million Dollar Man '' actor Lee Majors ' wife , when she shot a best-selling pinup poster in early 1976 at the behest of a Cleveland , Ohio , company called Pro Arts . Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away . The poster , with Fawcett 's million-dollar smile front and center and right nipple obvious through the fabric of her red bathing suit , became a sensation . Soon after the photo shoot , Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show , `` Charlie 's Angels , '' about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie . Fawcett , who played Jill Munroe , was the last to be cast -- co-star Kate Jackson was the known name at the time -- but , thanks to her poster , Fawcett became the series ' breakout star . The highly rated TV series kicked off what came to be known as `` jiggle TV , '' series full of young actresses who appeared in bikinis at the drop of a hat . `` Denunciations of ` massage parlor television ' and ` voyeurism ' only brought more viewers to the screen , to see what the controversy was about , '' wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in their exhaustive reference , `` The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows . '' `` Charlie 's Angels '' turned out to be a huge hit , and shows ranging from the sitcom `` Three 's Company '' to the drama `` Baywatch '' owe the show a debt . Fawcett did n't stay with `` Angels '' long . At the end of the first season , unhappy with her contract , she left the show , replaced by Cheryl Ladd . Fawcett 's career stagnated for a time after `` Charlie 's Angels , '' as she appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors . But her career received a major boost with her starring role in `` The Burning Bed , '' a 1984 made-for-television movie co-starring Paul LeMat . In the film , Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband 's bed as he lies sleeping . Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance . Around that time , Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O'Neal , with whom she had a son , Redmond , in 1985 . Redmond O'Neal was arrested Sunday morning for narcotics possession . In recent years , Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye . She posed nude for Playboy in 1995 . In 1997 , she appeared on `` The Late Show with David Letterman , '' an interview that became notorious for Fawcett 's apparent incoherence . She later said she was just having fun with Letterman . She reunited with her `` Charlie 's Angels '' co-stars , Jackson and Jaclyn Smith , for an awards-show appearance in 2006 . Fawcett has been making a documentary , `` A Wing and a Prayer , '' for NBC about her cancer battle . `` She is an icon , and you do n't become an icon by being weak , '' Nevius said Monday . `` All you have to do is look back at her 30-year-plus career to see that she is not somebody that has ever stepped down or backed down from a challenge of any kind .

{"answer":"Bangkok , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anti-government protesters poured a small amount of blood at the headquarters of the government in Bangkok on Tuesday , but the demonstration did not live up to their threat to douse the ministers ' offices in blood . The protesters had launched a blood drive earlier to collect enough samples for the demonstration . Thousands of `` red shirts '' -- so named for their clothing -- held out their forearms to allow their compatriots to draw blood . The protesters intended to collect 1,000 liters -LRB- 1 million cubic centimeters -RRB- and then throw the blood on the grounds of the Government House , which houses ministerial offices , at 6 p.m. -LRB- 7 a.m. ET -RRB- . `` Red shirts '' rally in Bangkok : Share your photos If Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva still refuses to dissolve parliament , the demonstrators said they will collect another 1,000 liters of blood Wednesday and splash it on the headquarters of the ruling party . The next day , they will collect 1,000 more liters and target the prime minister 's residence , the demonstrators said . What are the protests about ? Abhisit has repeatedly said he will listen to the protesters but will not accede to their demands . The anti-government demonstrations began Friday . By Sunday , tens of thousands of protesters had poured into the center of Bangkok . The rallies have been largely peaceful . Abhisit has said his government will not use force to quell the demonstrations . The nation 's tourism minister estimated the demonstrations might have resulted in a 20 percent drop in tourists . The impact on Chinese visitors appears to have been greater , with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce reporting a 50 percent cancellation rate . The protesters are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006 . Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular . He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated . The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections . Since Thaksin 's ouster , Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit supporters .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Serbian tennis player has been banned for life and fined $ 100,000 after being found guilty of match-fixing offenses . David Savic has been punished for three violations of the 2010 Uniform Tennis Anti-Corruption Program in October 2010 , it was revealed on Saturday . A Tennis Integrity Unit investigation found that the 26-year-old tried to contrive the outcome of an event , sought to persuade another player to not try to win and also offered money `` with the intention of negatively influencing a player 's best efforts in any event . '' Savic is currently ranked 659th in singles , with a highest standing of 363 in October 2009 . He is a compatriot of world No. 1 Novak Djokovic , who helped Serbia win the Davis Cup last year before winning three grand slam titles in 2011 .

{"answer":"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of Zimbabwe said Monday that he does not believe foul play was involved in a car wreck that killed his wife . The vehicle the couple were traveling in was left overturned off the highway . `` When something like that happens there is speculation , but I want to assure you if it was foul play , it is one in a thousand , '' he said Monday . `` It was an accident that took her life . '' Tsvangirai 's comments came amid widespread speculation that the wreck was caused by his political opponents aligned with President Robert Mugabe . Tsvangirai 's political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , has said the crash was an assassination attempt . It has called for an independent inquiry . Zimbabwe 's new prime minister was hurt in the wreck and returned home Monday from neighboring Botswana . `` Life has to go on and I 'm certain that if she was here she would liked life to go on , '' he said . `` It will be difficult to fill the gap left by her . '' Tsvangirai has long been a leading opposition figure in Zimbabwe , but he joined a coalition government with Mugabe last month . That seemed to resolve an impasse created by a disputed presidential election between Mugabe and Tsvangirai last year . Tsvangirai received the most votes in the March 2008 election , but he fell short of the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff . He withdrew as a candidate in the runoff , citing political violence and intimidation targeting his supporters . Negotiations between the two sides culminated in the power-sharing agreement that was implemented just weeks ago . Questions about the wreck surfaced shortly after it happened Friday on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare . On Saturday , members of Tsvangirai 's political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , told CNN that Tsvangirai believed that the driver of the truck that struck his car deliberately drove toward him in an effort to take his life . The party 's secretary-general , Tendai Biti , said police should have provided better security for Tsvangirai . The wreck might not have happened , he said , if a police escort been on hand . A former U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe , Tom McDonald , said the wreck raised suspicion . `` I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , '' said McDonald , who was ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 . `` President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone , lo and behold , dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they do n't like . '' McDonald , however , was quick to add that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe . The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road on which tractor-trailers are common , he said . Vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and many drivers are inexperienced , he said . `` It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , '' he said . -- CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step Thursday of telling college students not to visit Mexican border cities during spring break because they are just too dangerous . Several universities issued similar warnings last year , but this was the first time the Texas law enforcement agency had issued the specific advisory against travel , said spokeswoman Tela Mange . In the past , she said , Texas authorities had just urged students to be careful . `` Because of the increased violence , we decided to step it up a little bit and say , ` Parents , bad idea , ' '' Mange said . DPS Director Steven C. McCraw said , `` Parents should not allow their children to visit these Mexican cities because their safety can not be guaranteed . '' The State Department renewed a travel alert to Mexico last month , citing increased violence in the country -- border areas in particular . `` Recent violent attacks have caused the U.S. Embassy to urge U.S. citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan , Durango , Coahuila and Chihuahua ... and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution , '' the alert says . More than 16,000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006 . Ciudad Juarez , in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso , Texas , is the most violent city in the nation . `` The situation in the state of Chihuahua , specifically Ciudad Juarez , is of special concern , '' the alert says . Two U.S. citizens were abducted and killed in Chihuahua , the State Department said . `` Mexican authorities report that more than 2,600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009 , '' the report states . `` Additionally , this city of 1.3 million people experienced more than 16,000 car thefts and 1,900 carjackings in 2009 . U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez , avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours , and remain alert to news reports . '' But the problems are not limited to Juarez , the State Department says . `` Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.S.-Mexico border , '' the report says . `` In order to combat violence , the government of Mexico has deployed military troops throughout the country . U.S. citizens should cooperate fully with official checkpoints when traveling on Mexican highways . `` Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades . Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities across Mexico , but occur mostly in northern Mexico , including Ciudad Juarez , Tijuana , Chihuahua City , Nogales , Matamoros , Reynosa and Monterrey . During some of these incidents , U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area . '' A number of areas along the border continue to experience a rapid growth in crime , with robberies , homicides , petty thefts and carjackings increasing during the past year nationwide , the alert says .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The struggle for women 's rights against the backdrops of the Arab Spring and democratic progress in Africa will be recognized by this year 's Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday , at a ceremony unlikely to repeat controversy seen last year . Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , and Leymah Gbowee , a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country , will share the prize with Tawakkul Karman , an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in Yemen . The three , chosen `` for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights to full participation in peace-building work , '' will be honored in Oslo , Norway , during a program of events that culminates on Sunday in a star-studded concert . All three will be interviewed by CNN 's Jonathan Mann , a veteran of Nobel Peace Prize ceremonies , shortly after they receive their medals and $ 1.5 million in cash . The interviews and concert , hosted by actors Helen Mirren and Rosario Dawson , will be broadcast live online and mobile on CNN.com . Acts performing at the concert include David Gray , Jill Scott , rock band Evanescence and country duo Sugarland . Johnson Sirleaf , a 73-year-old Harvard graduate whose political resilience has earned her the nickname `` Iron Lady , '' became Africa 's first democratically-elected female president in 2006 , three years after decades of civil war ended . Crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former President Charles Taylor , she declared a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary-age children .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter and dumping her body in Texas ' Galveston Bay went on trial Tuesday on capital murder charges in the child 's death , court officials said . Kimberly Dawn Trenor has pleaded guilty to an evidence-tampering charge , her attorney says . Kimberly Dawn Trenor , 20 , pleaded guilty last week to tampering with evidence in the case , but she pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge , said her attorney , Tom Stickler . Trenor 's husband , Royce Clyde Zeigler II , 25 , also faces capital murder and evidence-tampering charges , but is being tried separately and has not been arraigned . The body of Trenor 's daughter , Riley Ann Sawyers , was found in October 2007 in a large plastic blue container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay . Jurors in Trenor 's trial also will determine her sentence on the evidence-tampering charge , which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison , according to The Houston Chronicle . Riley Ann 's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body . Authorities were unsure of her identity , and police dubbed her `` Baby Grace . '' After authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide , Sheryl Sawyers , the girl 's paternal grandmother , contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter . DNA testing confirmed the child 's identity . According to an affidavit , Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on July 24 , 2007 . She said the couple hid the girl 's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay . The disposal of the girl 's body led to the evidence-tampering charge . A medical examiner said Riley 's skull was fractured in three places , injuries that would have been fatal . A capital murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison , the Chronicle reported . A cross has since been erected on the island where the toddler was found , which was named Riley 's Island in her honor , according to the Houston newspaper . Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May 2007 to be with Zeigler , whom Trenor had met on the Internet . While in custody , Trenor gave birth this summer to another child , who is now in the care of relatives , her attorney , Tom Stickler , said .","question":""}
{"answer":"ORLANDO , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An ex-astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival in a Florida parking lot will stand trial December 7 , a judge ruled . Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles wearing NASA diapers to track down her rival . Lisa Marie Nowak , 46 , is accused of stalking Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman and pepper-spraying her in a parking lot at Orlando International Airport in February 2007 . She has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon . If convicted , she could face a sentence of up to life in prison . Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot . Her attorney , Don Lykkebak , has denied that she wore the diapers . Shipman told police that after she got into her car , Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window . When Shipman cracked it to talk to her , Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , Shipman said . Police said Nowak was apprehended as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin . Nowak has said she went to the airport to talk to Shipman , who had begun dating Nowak 's former love interest , Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein , who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps . Judge Marc Lubet handed Nowak a legal victory in November 2007 when he ruled evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial because both were unlawfully obtained . Prosecutors appealed , however , and in July 2008 , the Fifth District Court of Appeals ruled that evidence found in Nowak 's car was admissible , although it agreed her statements to police were not . At a hearing in August 2007 , Orlando police detective William Becton testified that when he searched Nowak 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein 's mother . He also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car . Police previously said they also found a BB gun , a steel mallet , a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle . Nowak 's attorneys have said they intend to utilize an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include more than a dozen psychiatric disorders . A pretrial conference in the case is set for November 10 , Lubet ruled Tuesday . A hearing set for Friday was canceled . CNN 's Rich Phillips contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Robert Mugabe 's political rivals Saturday accused the Zimbabwean president of `` ambush '' in allocating key ministries to his own party in defiance of a power-sharing agreement aimed at ending political turmoil in the country . The opposition MDC accuses Mugabe of `` ambush . '' Zimbabwe 's state-run Herald newspaper reported that ministries inlcuding defense , justice , and media , were being placed in the hands of Mugabe 's ZANU-PF . Party spokesman Bright Matonga said the move had cross-party support but the Movement for Democratic Change 's Nelson Chamisa decried the move is an `` ambush '' that puts the power-sharing deal in jeopardy . Under the deal reached last month , Mugabe stays in office but shares power with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai , who became vice president . Arthur Mutambara , who leads a splinter MDC faction , became deputy vice president . `` The MDC dismisses ZANU-PF 's unilaterally gazetted wish list of ministries , which is a betrayal of the wishes , expectations and aspirations of the majority of Zimbabweans , '' the MDC said in a statement . `` It is a giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy . '' The plan outlined in The Herald would give 14 government ministries to ZANU-PF and 13 to the MDC . Three ministries would go to Mutambara 's faction . Among the ministries reportedly allocated to ZANU-PF are defense , home affairs , foreign affairs , justice and legal affairs , and media and information . Ministries given to Tsvangirai 's MDC would include constitutional and parliamentary affairs , economic planning , health , labor , and sport , arts and culture , the paper said . Mutambara would oversee education , industry and commerce , and regional integration and international cooperation . The ministry of finance , the paper said , remains in dispute . The MDC accused the ZANU-PF of trying to undermine the work of former South African President Thabo Mbeki , who helped broker a deal to end months of violence following a disputed election . The paper said Mbeki was due to to go Zimbabwe to resolve the question of the finance ministry . Mbeki mediated the power-sharing talks that aimed to resolve the disputed March election . Tsvangirai won the most votes in March but not enough to avoid a runoff , according to the government 's official count . Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote , saying Mugabe 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hurricane Ida moved into the southern Gulf of Mexico Sunday , prompting a declaration of emergency in Louisiana and concern along the U.S. Gulf Coast . The storm regained hurricane intensity overnight Saturday , becoming a Category 2 hurricane , but forecasters said it is expected to weaken as it moves north . Ida drenched Nicaragua after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane , then weakened to a tropical storm before resuming strength . In El Salvador , at least 91 people died in flooding and mudslides , according to the government , but a low-pressure system out of the Pacific -- not Hurricane Ida -- triggered the disaster , forecaster Robby Berg of the National Hurricane Center said Sunday . A hurricane warning , meaning hurricane conditions are possible within 24 hours , extends from Pascagoula , Mississippi to Indian Pass , Florida , forecasters said . From Grande Isle , Louisiana , to west of Pascagoula , Mississippi , a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect . This area includes New Orleans , which the center earlier excluded from the watch , and Lake Pontchartrain , the hurricane center said . In anticipation of the storm 's arrival , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon . Hurricane Ida `` threatens the safety and security of those citizens '' along the state 's southeast coastline , he wrote in the declaration . The declaration gives the director of the governor 's office of emergency preparedness authority `` to undertake any activity authorized by law which he deems necessary and appropriate '' to prepare for the possibility of a hurricane . Track Ida 's progress , potential path Alabama 's Baldwin County commission urged that residents living in mobile homes , coastal communities or low-lying , flood-prone areas voluntarily evacuate . The county is under a local state of emergency and opened a shelter , according to a Sunday night statement from the county commission . As of 10 p.m. ET Sunday , Ida had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph -LRB- 165 km\/hr -RRB- with higher gusts . But the storm was expected to weaken on Monday and possibly begin losing tropical characteristics on Tuesday , the hurricane center said . The center of Ida was located about 400 miles -LRB- 645 km -RRB- south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River , forecasters said . It was moving north-northwest at nearly 14 mph -LRB- 22 km\/hr -RRB- and was expected to increase in speed . The storm was expected to be near coastal areas of the northern Gulf by Monday night or early Tuesday , the hurricane center said . As Ida moves in the Gulf of Mexico , conditions are expected to be unfavorable for any additional development , said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen . Ida is expected to weaken because of a combination of wind shear , cooler water temperatures and the storm 's interaction with a strong frontal system pushing off the Gulf Coast , he said . But Ida is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves in the northern Gulf toward the U.S. coast , the center said . Florida 's Division of Emergency Management asked residents to have disaster plans in place . `` Whether Ida maintains a storm or loses tropical characteristics , the Florida Gulf Coast region has the potential to see several inches of rain , strong winds , isolated tornadoes and dangerous surf and coastal flooding beginning Monday evening and continuing into Wednesday , '' the office said in a statement . The area stretching from Indian Pass , Florida , to Aucilla River , Florida , is also under a tropical storm warning . Tropical storm conditions are possible within 24 hours , the center said . Ida could drop between 1 and 3 inches of rain on portions of western Cuba , with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some spots , forecasters said . The central and eastern areas of the Gulf Coast northward to eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian Mountains could see 3 to 5 inches of rain with some areas getting as much as 8 inches , the center said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino , whose `` People Power '' movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband 's assassination , has died at age 76 , her family announced Saturday . `` She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy , '' said Ray Donato , the nation 's consul-general in Atlanta . Aquino , the first woman to lead the Philippines , had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday -LRB- 3:18 p.m. Friday ET -RRB- , said Mai Mislang , a spokeswoman for her son , Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III . Funeral arrangements were being set up , Mislang said . Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president , said Ray Donato , the country 's consul-general in Atlanta . `` She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy , and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency , '' Donato said . Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States . She had not been involved in politics before her husband , opposition leader Benigno `` Ninoy '' Aquino Jr. , was gunned down at Manila 's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile . The political novice took over the leadership of her husband 's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election , making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country 's Roman Catholic churches . Marcos had been backed by the United States , the former colonial power in the Philippines , for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist . He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife , Nancy . But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country 's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support , and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii . Aquino took office in a country with a $ 28 billion debt , widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency . She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help . She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992 . The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos , but Aquino 's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States . Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the `` orderly withdrawal '' of U.S. forces .","question":""}

Altonaga sentenced Charles `` Chuckie '' Taylor Jr. , 31 , in a Friday morning session that lasted four hours , according to a court document . Altonaga cited Taylor 's `` sadistic , cruel and atrocious past , '' saying it `` constituted unacceptable , universally condemned torture , '' The Miami Herald reported . `` The lengthy prison term handed down today justly reflects the horror and torture that Taylor Jr. visited upon his victims , '' said Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division . Taylor , also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel , was convicted October 30 of torture , conspiracy to commit torture and firearm charges . His case , tried in Miami , was the first brought under a 1994 U.S. law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court , as long as the person is a U.S. national or is present in the United States , regardless of nationality . Calls to Taylor 's defense attorneys were not immediately returned . Prosecutors had asked for Taylor to be sentenced to 147 years . Taylor was born in Boston , Massachusetts , but he moved to Liberia when his father was named president . Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president .

Taylor and his associated burned victims with molten plastic , lighted cigarettes , candle wax and an iron . Some were severely beaten with firearms , cut and stabbed and shocked with an electric device , prosecutors said in an indictment that superseded the initial indictment from 2006 . In the initial indictment , Taylor was charged with one count of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime . The superseding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture , one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Banana producer Chiquita will pay a $ 25 million fine and serve five years ' probation for once paying millions of dollars to groups in Colombia considered by the U.S. to be terrorist organizations , a Department of Justice spokesman said Tuesday . A worker at a banana plantation in Santa Maria , Colombia , in December 2000 . In so doing , the banana producer avoided prosecution for the company 's now-defunct payoff of Colombian terrorists protecting its most profitable banana-growing operation , according to terms of a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department . If approved by U.S. courts , the $ 25 million fine would represent the largest U.S. criminal penalty ever imposed under federal global terrorism sanction regulations , said Justice spokesman Dean Boyd . The regulations prohibit transactions with people who commit , threaten to commit or support U.S.-designated terrorists and establish penalties for doing so . Attorneys from the Justice Department 's National Security Division and federal prosecutors for the District of Columbia filed a joint sentencing motion Tuesday asking the court to accept the plea agreement , which was reached March 19 , Boyd said . A hearing on the matter is set for Monday . In its motion , the government asked that Chiquita Brands International be fined and sentenced to probation , as well as being required to implement an effective ethics program in connection with the company 's guilty plea , Boyd said . Federal prosecutors accused the Cincinnati-based company of paying more than $ 1.7 million to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia , a right-wing paramilitary group , in two parts of Colombia where the company grew bananas . The payments to the group , known as the AUC , went through the company 's Colombian subsidiary , Banadex , from 1997 to 2004 , according to court documents filed in the case . Court papers also say Chiquita paid Colombia 's two leftist guerrilla groups , the FARC -LRB- Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -RRB- and ELN -LRB- National Liberation Army -RRB- from about 1989 to 1997 . At the time , according to court documents , those groups controlled areas where the company grew bananas . The AUC , FARC and ELN are all combatants in Colombia 's decade-long civil war , and all have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States . In a written statement issued in March , Chiquita Brands International CEO Fernando Aguirre said the company viewed the plea agreement `` as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago . '' The company voluntarily disclosed the payments to the Justice Department in 2003 , he said , adding the payments were made `` to protect the lives of its employees . '' Court documents said the company began making the payments after a Banadex general manager met with the then-leader of the AUC , Carlos Castano . Castano told the manager that the AUC was preparing to drive FARC from Colombia 's Uraba region and asked for payments to be made to the AUC through private security companies . `` Castano sent an unspoken but clear message that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property , '' court documents said . Charges filed in the case said senior company executives knew about the payments to the AUC and , while checks were written to the security companies , the companies provided no actual services . In 2002 , after the U.S. government designated the AUC as a terrorist organization , Chiquita began paying the organization in cash , according to court documents , and continued the payments even after being told by outside counsel that the payments were illegal and should be stopped . In the motion filed Tuesday , federal prosecutors noted Chiquita 's cooperation in the investigation and its voluntary disclosure of its illegal activity , Boyd said . While the government considered filing additional charges in the matter , it decided not to `` after an extensive investigation and after considering critical evidence and information that Chiquita provided through its post-plea cooperation , '' he said . Chiquita sold Banadex to another company more than two years ago but remains one of the largest purchasers of bananas in Colombia .

Beatty agreed to a plea arrangement under which she will serve five years probation -- the first 120 days to be served in jail -- and pay a $ 100,000 fine , `` based on -LSB- Beatty 's -RSB- ability to pay , '' Miller said . Beatty will begin serving her jail sentence on January 5 , when she will be formally sentenced , Miller said . Kym L. Worthy , prosecuting attorney for Wayne County , released a statement saying she is `` very pleased that this defendant admitted her guilt . '' `` We live in an age where greed and protecting one 's secrets is glorified and accepted , '' Worthy said . `` Now the city of Detroit , the region and the state of Michigan can truly begin to move forward when this ugly chapter in Detroit 's history is put to rest . '' In September , Kilpatrick resigned as mayor and pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges stemming from his efforts to cover up his relationship with Beatty . Like Beatty , Kilpatrick was sentenced to five years probation with the first four months to be served in jail . He is serving that sentence in the Wayne County jail . At the time of his sentencing in October , the judge in the case called Kilpatrick `` arrogant and defiant , '' particularly for a televised speech that aired hours after Kilpatrick entered his pleas . `` That night , the community expected to hear a message of humility , remorse and apology , '' Wayne County Circuit Judge David Groner said at Kilpatrick 's sentencing . `` Instead , we heard an arrogant and defiant man who accused the governor , among others , for his downfall . '' In addition to his jail and probation sentence , Kilpatrick must also pay the city of Detroit $ 1 million in restitution , and forfeit any future pension . Initially , Kilpatrick was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up an affair with Beatty , then his chief of staff . When that deputy , Gary Brown , filed a whistle-blower suit , Kilpatrick and Beatty denied under oath that an affair had taken place between them . Text messages that contradicted Kilpatrick 's and Beatty 's denials of an affair were made public in January by the Detroit Free Press , and county prosecutor Worthy charged Kilpatrick and Beatty with multiple counts of perjury , obstruction of justice and misconduct in office . The most serious charges would have carried a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison upon conviction . Beatty resigned her post after the text messages were made public . Kilpatrick initially refused to resign after the scandal broke , and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm called a hearing on whether she should remove him from office at the request of the Detroit City Council . Granholm adjourned those hearings after Kilpatrick pleaded guilty and resigned in September .","question":""}
{"answer":"LAGOS , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 200 people have died of meningitis in the past week alone in Niger and Nigeria , according to the World Health Organization . A health care worker vaccinates a child during an earlier outbreak of meningitis in Niger . The disease is an epidemic in 76 areas of the two countries , the health agency reported Wednesday . A spokesman for W.H.O. in Nigeria , Dr. Olaokun Soyinka , said Saturday that the outbreak is bigger than usual and stretches across the African meningitis belt from east - to west-sub-Saharan Africa . The outbreak began around the start of the year , Soyinka told CNN . It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust , winds and cold nights , before dipping around May when the rains come , he said . A shortage of vaccines means officials are relying on '' effective prevention , '' in which they watch for outbreaks and then vaccinate people in the epicenter and surrounding areas , Soyinka told CNN . There have been nearly 25,000 suspected cases and more than 1,500 deaths in the meningitis belt in the first 11 weeks of the year , W.H.O. reported . More than 85 percent of those cases happened in northern Nigeria and Niger . Nigeria 's Ministry of Health has reported 17,462 suspected cases of meningococcal disease , including 960 deaths , the world health agency said . In the past week , it reported 4,164 suspected cases with 171 deaths . Sixty-six local government areas in Nigeria have crossed the epidemic threshold . Epidemic thresholds are a way the W.H.O. confirms the emergence of an epidemic so it can step up vaccinations and other management measures . Niger 's Ministry of Health has reported 4,513 suspected cases of meningococcal disease , including 169 deaths , since the start of the year . In the past week , 1,071 suspected cases and 30 deaths have been reported , the W.H.O. said . Ten of Niger 's 42 districts have crossed the epidemic threshold .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to 45 years in prison in a deadly bank robbery plot -- described by the judge in the case as `` incredibly bizarre '' -- in which a pizza deliveryman died when a bomb affixed to his neck exploded . This device held a bomb to the neck of Brian Wells during a 2003 bank robbery in Erie , Pennsylvania . At the sentencing in Erie , Pennsylvania , prosecutors repeated their contention that the pizza deliveryman was involved in planning the robbery attempt but wore a live bomb only after being threatened by his co-conspirators . Kenneth Barnes , 55 , of Erie , was sentenced Wednesday after he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy to commit bank robbery and using a destructive device during a crime of violence . Prosecutors said Barnes and three co-conspirators -- one of whom was pizza deliveryman Brian Wells -- planned to rob a PNC Bank on the outskirts of Erie , and Wells , 46 , carried out the robbery on August 28 , 2003 . Authorities said Wells walked into the bank with a pipe bomb locked to his neck and passed a note demanding money to a teller . The robbery netted about $ 8,700 . Wells died when the bomb exploded as he sat in a parking lot after being stopped by police shortly after the robbery . The case drew national attention and was the subject of intense investigation and questions about whether Wells was a willing participant or a murder victim . Prosecutors said after Barnes ' sentencing that Wells was involved in planning the robbery but balked when he realized that the bomb he was supposed to wear was real . He was threatened with a gun to make him wear the bomb , according to prosecutors . U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan called the sentence `` appropriate and just , '' and said the contentions of Wells ' family that he was not involved in the plot are `` overwhelmingly '' countered by evidence of meetings with Wells , Barnes and the other two co-conspirators before the robbery . One of the alleged co-conspirators is now dead and the other one , Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong , is undergoing treatment at a federal facility in Texas after the judge in the case found her mentally incompetent to stand trial . Her case will be re-examined by the court next year , said Margaret Philbin , spokeswoman for Buchanan 's office . In sentencing Barnes , U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin said , `` To me , the callousness and complete lack of regard for human life is , in a word , chilling . This case represents the unhappy combination of incredibly bizarre and sadly tragic . ''","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of boxing great Joe Frazier on Wednesday announced details of his Philadelphia funeral services and said he died as `` one of God 's men . '' Frazier , who handed the legendary Muhammad Ali his first defeat , died Monday , just a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer . The 67-year-old athlete 's remains will be in public view at the Wells Fargo Center from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Saturday , the family said . `` This will be an opportunity for his many fans , supporters and boxing lovers from around the world to pay their final respects to Joe Frazier . '' The service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church . `` The Family of Joe Frazier continues to stress that they want everyone to know that Joe Frazier was a man of God and a man who loved all of his family , '' relatives said in a statement . Star boxer Floyd `` Money '' Mayweather offered to pay for Frazier 's funeral . The family said donations in Frazier 's memory can be made to the American Cancer Society . The former heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled hometown , Philadelphia -- a fitting setting for the `` Rocky '' film series , starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa . Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called Frazier the `` quintessential Philadelphia boxer . '' `` You could hear him coming , snorting and grunting and puffing , like a steam engine climbing a steep grade , '' Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier , nicknamed `` Smokin ' Joe .

Frazier bested Ali at 1971 's `` Fight of the Century '' at Madison Square Garden . In the 15th round , Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history , catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count , according to Frazier 's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame . Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ and handed Ali his first professional loss . Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974 rematch , setting the stage for the classic `` Thrilla in Manila '' just outside the Philippine capital in 1975 . Ali took the early rounds , but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds . By the end of the 14th , Frazier 's eyes were nearly swollen shut , and his corner stopped the bout , according to the biography .

{"answer":"Apex , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Monday that he is `` very proud '' of having told Barack Obama early on that he believed he was a viable candidate for president and could win election . Responding to the controversy surrounding a newly published remark he made privately about Obama 's race in 2008 , Reid sought to emphasize his longstanding support for the nation 's first African-American president . `` I can still remember the meeting that took place in my office with Sen. Barack Obama , telling him that I think he can be elected president , '' Reid said . Obama `` was kind of surprised that the Democratic leader was calling this new senator over to suggest that he could be elected president , '' he added . A new book quotes Reid , D-Nevada , as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his `` light-skinned '' appearance and speaking patterns `` with no Negro dialect , unless he wanted to have one . '' Reid said Monday that numerous prominent African-American officials , including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder , have called him to offer support amid the controversy that began over the weekend . `` I 've apologized to everyone with the sound of my voice that I could have used a better choice of words , '' he said after an event announcing a new energy project in his home state . `` And I 'll continue doing my work for the African-American community . '' Reid said that `` as a very young man , '' he became a leader of civil rights efforts , including the integration of the gaming community . He added that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called him to say he should `` tell everybody that you have done more for diversity in the United States Senate than all the rest of the people put together . '' Asked whether he should apologize to voters , Reid -- who had issued a statement over the weekend apologizing `` for offending any and all Americans '' -- did not answer directly and instead cited the support he has received from around the country and within his own state . `` I 'm not going to dwell on this any more , '' Reid said . `` It 's in the book . I 've made all the statements I 'm going to make . '' iReport : What do you think about the words Reid used ? The book he referred to , `` Game Change , '' went on sale Monday . The authors write that `` Reid was convinced , in fact , that Obama 's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination . '' Reid apologized in a statement sent to CNN over the weekend . `` I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words , '' he said . He added , `` I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans , especially African-Americans , for my improper comments . I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama 's legislative agenda . '' Reid called the president Saturday and apologized . In a statement issued after the call , Obama expressed support for Reid , saying , `` As far as I am concerned , the book is closed . '' Speaking to CNN contributor Roland Martin , Obama described Reid as `` a friend of mine . He has been a stalwart champion of voting rights , civil rights . '' `` This is a good man who has always been on the right side of history . For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me and for people to try and make hay out of that makes absolutely no sense , '' he said in the interview , which will air this month . `` I guarantee you the average person , white or black , right now is less concerned about what Harry Reid said in a quote in a book a couple of years ago than they are about how we are going to move the country forward , and that 's where we need to direct our attention . '' A senior administration official said Monday that Obama will go to Nevada in February to campaign on behalf of Reid . iReporter : `` I do n't think he should be kicked out of the Senate '' Reid also called a host of African-American political figures , including House Democrats Barbara Lee of California and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina ; the Rev. Al Sharpton ; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile ; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights , Wade Henderson . Republicans pounced on the controversy . Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , head of the GOP 's Senate campaign arm , called for Reid to give up his leadership posts after the `` embarrassing and racially insensitive '' remarks . Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele , speaking Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' also called for Reid to step down . `` Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America , '' the first African-American GOP chairman said . Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week . Speaking to Fox News , Steele said the GOP platform `` is one of the best political documents that 's been written in the last 25 years , honest Injun on that . '' `` Fox News Sunday '' host Chris Wallace said lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur . `` Well , if it is , I apologize for it . It 's not an intent to be a racial slur . I was n't intending to say a racial slur at all , '' Steele said . iReporter : Mixing race and politics equals trouble Numerous Democrats came to Reid 's defense . The Congressional Black Caucus said Sunday that it had accepted his apology and dismissed calls for the Nevada Democrat to step down . `` Sen. Reid 's record provides a stark contrast to actions of Republicans to block legislation that would benefit poor and minority communities , '' Lee , chairwoman of the caucus , said in a written statement . Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton , D-District of Columbia , a former chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , issued a statement saying , `` Like President Barack Obama , African-Americans are likely to accept Majority Leader Reid 's apology for an obvious reason . He has earned it . '' She added , `` Harry Reid 's opponents will not find a welcome mat in the black community if they seek to capitalize on the Reid remark . While Sen. Reid has been producing for African-Americans , many of his critics were opposing him on these same issues . '' Democrats rejected a parallel drawn by some Republicans between Reid 's remark and one by former Sen. Trent Lott , R-Mississippi , in 2002 . Lott lost his post as Senate majority leader after saying the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been elected president . Thurmond had run as a segregationist candidate in 1948 . `` There is a big double standard here , '' Steele said on NBC . `` When Democrats get caught saying racist things , you know , an apology is enough . '' Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia , chairman of the Democratic Party , shot back , telling NBC that `` there is no comparison '' between the two sets of remarks . Reid is embroiled in a tough re-election campaign to stay in the Senate . Only one-third of Nevada voters have a favorable opinion of him , while 52 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the four-term senator , according to a survey by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for the Las Vegas Review-Journal released over the weekend . The poll was conducted Tuesday through Thursday , before news of Reid 's comments broke . CNN 's Dana Bash , Mark Preston , Rebecca Sinderbrand and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democrats increased their 36-seat majority in the U.S. House , according to CNN projections , by defeating established Republicans and winning open seats as they capitalized on an unpopular GOP president . Rep. Chris Shays , R-Connecticut , failed to win his 11th full term . Democrats clinched a majority and took at least 21 seats from Republicans , with the GOP taking only four from the Democrats , according to CNN projections as of 4 a.m. ET Wednesday . With winners yet to be called for 11 of the House 's 435 seats , Democrats were projected to win 251 seats , with Republicans having 173 . Heading into Election Day , the Democrats had a 235-199 majority . The Democrats ' apparent gains Tuesday come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority . Among Tuesday 's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut , whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party could n't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes . Shays ' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House . Shays was seeking his 11th full term . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , said Tuesday night she was confident Democrats would ride a `` wave '' of pro-Democratic sentiment across the country and add to their House majority , though she declined to predict by how much . Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change `` We have surfers to ride that wave , '' Pelosi said at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington , where she was watching election results . Here are highlights of other races with projected winners : \u2022 Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio , including that of Rep. Steve Chabot , who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates . CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus . Just two years earlier , Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio 's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat . Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula . Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP 's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest . \u2022 In New York , Democrats won three Republican seats , including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election . In one of the open races , Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City , defeating the GOP 's Robert Straniere . Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland , who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh . In a rematch of a 2006 race , former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican . \u2022 Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minnesota , was projected to survive a race that tightened after she made comments about Sen. Barack Obama last month . She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting . Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama 's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views . Bachmann 's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg . \u2022 In Florida , Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win . Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney , and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller . However , brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart , who represent districts in southern Florida , held off their Democratic challengers . Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term , defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez . \u2022 Democratic incumbents were n't invulnerable in Florida . Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger , Tom Rooney . Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district . But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money . Mahoney admitted to causing `` pain '' in his marriage , but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet . \u2022 In Pennsylvania , Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell . Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district `` a racist area '' and `` redneck . '' \u2022 The House 's third-ranking Republican , Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida , was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he would n't run again for a leadership post , saying he wanted to return his focus `` to crafting public policy solutions for America 's generational challenges . '' He is currently the GOP conference chairman . \u2022 In a heavily Republican district near Houston , Texas , Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson . Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges . \u2022 In Ohio 's 11th District , Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones . Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek . Tubbs Jones , who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs , died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm . \u2022 The House 's first two Muslim members , Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana , won their contests Tuesday . Carson has won his first full term ; he had succeeded his grandmother , the late Rep. Julia Carson , in a March special election . Not all 435 seats will be decided immediately . Two Louisiana districts used Election Day for primary run-offs ; the general election for those seats will be December 6 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Griffin Bell , who served as attorney general in the Carter administration , has died , according to the Carter Center in Atlanta , Georgia . He was 90 . Griffin Bell is sworn in as attorney general in January 1977 . Former President Jimmy Carter issued a statement saying that he and former first lady Rosalynn Carter were deeply saddened by Bell 's death . `` A trusted and enduring public figure , Griffin 's integrity , professionalism , and charm were greatly valued across party lines and presidential administrations , '' Carter said . `` As a World War II veteran , federal appeals court judge , civil rights advocate , and U.S. attorney general in my administration , Griffin made many lasting contributions to his native Georgia and country . Our thoughts and prayers are with his family . '' The son of a south Georgia cotton farmer , Bell passed the Georgia bar exam while still a student in law school , according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia . He went on to help build the prominent Atlanta law firm King and Spalding , and then to serve as the nation 's top legal officer . He was a chairman of John F. Kennedy 's 1960 presidential campaign , and Kennedy appointed him to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961 . As a federal judge , Bell was involved in desegregation rulings in the 1960s , and he became known as a moderate legal voice in the South . Fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter nominated Bell as attorney general in 1976 . He was confirmed shortly after Carter 's inauguration but only after sometimes difficult Senate hearings . Bell 's memberships in private segregated clubs and some of his decisions as a federal judge became issues . He was confirmed in January 1977 by a Senate vote of 75 to 21 . Bell 's tenure as attorney general followed the Watergate era , and he was credited with helping restore public confidence in the Justice Department during the late 1970s . Bell resigned as attorney general in 1979 to return to private law practice in Atlanta with King and Spalding . He resurfaced in the public eye periodically , including in 2004 when he was listed among Georgia Democrats who endorsed President George W. Bush for re-election . Also in 2004 , he co-authored an independent study ordered by FBI Director Robert Mueller of the FBI 's internal disciplinary procedures . The report sharply criticized the FBI and called its methods for determining punishments for its agents `` seriously flawed . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.N. tribunal convicted two Serb cousins Monday of having burned alive more than 100 Muslims in what the presiding judge called a part of the `` wretched history of man 's inhumanity to man . '' Serb Milan Lukic has been found guilty of burning alive more than 100 Muslims . Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic were convicted of crimes dating back to the early 1990s , during the bitter ethnic conflict that ravaged the former Yugoslavia . Milan Lukic organized a group of local paramilitaries with ties to police and the military , sometimes referred to as the `` White Eagles '' or `` Avengers , '' according to an indictment . Before and during the war , his cousin Sredoje Lukic worked as a policeman before joining the group . The crimes include two incidents in which Muslim men , women and children were forced into homes that were then set on fire -- and some who tried to escape were shot . Milan Lukic was found `` guilty of persecutions , murder , extermination , cruel treatment and inhumane acts , as crimes against humanity and war crimes , in relation to six discrete incidents , '' the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia -LRB- ICTY -RRB- at the Hague said . He was sentenced to life in prison . Sredoje Lukic was found guilty of `` aiding and abetting the commission of the crime of persecutions inhumane acts , murder and cruel treatment . '' He was sentenced to 30 years in prison . Their crimes were committed during the 1990s . Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992 and Radovan Karadzic declared himself president of a Bosnian Serb republic . The Bosnian Serbs , backed by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces , quickly seized control of most of the country and laid siege to Sarajevo , the capital . During the conflict that followed , the Serb forces launched what they called the `` ethnic cleansing '' of the territories under their control -- the forced displacement and killings of Muslims and Croats . The cousins ' cases are a small part of the caseload the Tribunal has dealt with regarding violations of humanitarian law committed in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001 . Since its creation the Tribunal has indicted 161 people on charges of serious violations of humanitarian law . The court found Milan Lukic responsible for the murder of 59 Muslim women , children and elderly men in a house in the town of Visegrad . `` On 14 June 1992 , the victims were locked into one room of the house which was then set on fire , '' the tribunal wrote . `` Milan Lukic was found to have placed the explosive device into the room , which set the house ablaze . Milan Lukic shot at people trying to escape from the burning house . '' Sredoje Lukic `` knew what would happen to the victims that he helped herd '' into the home , the court wrote in its judgment . Milan Lukic was also found guilty of the murder of at least 60 Muslim civilians in another house in Visegrad later that same month . The court found that he and others `` forced the civilians inside the house , blocked all exits and threw in several explosive devices and petrol , setting the house on fire . '' In all , the court found that Milan Lukic `` personally killed at least 132 Muslim people . '' The defense for both men denied the accusations against them , but the evidence demonstrated their guilt , the court said in its judgment . `` The perpetration by Milan Lukic and Sredoje Lukic of crimes in this case is characterized by a callous and vicious disregard for human life , '' presiding judge Patrick Robinson said . `` In the all too long , sad and wretched history of man 's inhumanity to man , the Pionirska street and Bikavac fires must rank high . `` At the close of the twentieth century , a century marked by war and bloodshed on a colossal scale , these horrific events stand out for the viciousness of the incendiary attack , for the obvious premeditation and calculation that defined it , for the sheer callousness and brutality of herding , trapping and locking the victims in the two houses , thereby rendering them helpless in the ensuing inferno , and for the degree of pain and suffering inflicted on the victims as they were burnt alive .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Bush administration misused intelligence to build a case for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a report issued Thursday . President Bush did n't request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , the Senate panel 's report says . The White House exploited its ability to declassify intelligence selectively to bolster its case for war , the committee chairman , Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV , D-West Virginia , said in the report . Senior officials disclosed and discussed sensitive intelligence reports that supported the administration 's policy objectives and kept out of public discourse information that did not , he said . The report also found that the administration misled the American people about contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda . `` Policymakers ' statements did not accurately convey the intelligence assessments '' about contacts between the then-Iraqi leader and Osama bin Laden 's group , `` and left the impression that the contacts led to substantive Iraqi cooperation or support of al Qaeda , '' the report said . `` Statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that Iraq and al Qaeda had a partnership , or that Iraq had provided al Qaeda with weapons training , were not substantiated by the intelligence , '' according to the committee 's exhaustive report on prewar intelligence . The top Republican on the committee dismissed its findings as `` partisan gamesmanship . '' `` It is ironic that the Democrats would knowingly distort and misrepresent the committee 's findings and the intelligence in an effort to prove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the intelligence , '' said Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri . The White House also rejected the report as old news . `` I know this is another report , and I 'm sure that they put a lot of considerable thought into it , but this is a subject that has been gone over many many , many times , and I do n't know of anything that 's particularly new in it , '' said spokeswoman Dana Perino , who said she had not yet read it . She said the White House relied on the same information as the rest of the world , admitting that it was wrong but denying that Bush had set out to mislead the country . White House claims that Hussein was seeking weapons of mass destruction were partially backed by available intelligence , the report found , but did not reflect disputes within the intelligence community . The CIA , among others , believed Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons , but the Department of Energy disagreed , the report said . No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq after the invasion . The report also took the administration to task for its predictions about the aftermath of the invasion , including Vice President Dick Cheney 's assertion that U.S. troops would be greeted as liberators . Bush and Cheney did not request intelligence reports about the post-war situation , and their public statements did not reflect doubts and uncertainties in the intelligence community , the report said . The report comes days after former White House press spokesman Scott McClellan published a book saying Bush decided on war with Iraq soon after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . `` Bush and his advisers knew that the American people would almost certainly not support a war launched primarily for the ambitious purpose of transforming the Middle East . Rather than open this Pandora 's Box , the administration chose a different path -- not employing out-and-out deception , but shading the truth , '' McClellan wrote in his memoir , `` What Happened . '' Current and former White House officials have dismissed McClellan 's accusations , saying he was not in a position to know about top-level White House decision-making before the war when he was deputy press secretary . The Senate committee chairman slammed the White House in a statement marking the release of the long-awaited report . `` Before taking the country to war , this administration owed it to the American people to give them a 100 percent accurate picture of the threat we faced , '' Rockefeller said Thursday . `` Unfortunately , our committee has concluded that the administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence . In making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted or even nonexistent . As a result , the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed , '' he added . The report picked apart three speeches by Bush , including his 2003 State of the Union address two months before the invasion , one by Cheney and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell 's U.N. presentation about Iraq in the run-up to the war . The report was approved by a 10-5 vote , with some Republicans dissenting . Some GOP members of the committee had wanted the report to examine prewar statements by Democrats , including Sen. Hillary Clinton . Democrats on the committee blocked the suggestion and limited the report 's purview to administration statements only .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The House of Representatives voted unanimously Thursday to impeach Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr . of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana , making him the nation 's 15th federal judge ever impeached . `` Our investigation found that Judge Porteous participated in a pattern of corrupt conduct for years , '' said U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff , D-California , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Task Force on Judicial Impeachment . `` Litigants have the right to expect a judge hearing their case will be fair and impartial , and avoid even the appearance of impropriety . Regrettably , no one can have that expectation in Judge Porteous ' courtroom . '' After the impeachment vote , Schiff and Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Virginia , were named the lead impeachment managers for the Senate trial , which will decide whether to remove Porteous from the bench . `` Today 's vote marks only the second time in over 20 years that this has occurred , '' Goodlatte said in a House news release . `` However , when evidence emerges that an individual is abusing his judicial office for his own advantage , the integrity of the entire judicial system becomes compromised . '' In a statement , Porteous ' lawyer Richard W. Westling said the Justice Department had decided not to prosecute because it did not have credible evidence . `` Unfortunately , the House has decided to disregard the Justice Department 's decision and to move forward with impeachment . As a result , we will now turn to the Senate to seek a full and fair hearing of all of the evidence . '' In a telephone interview , Westling said he did not know when the Senate trial would be held . `` There are no clear rules that dictate timing , '' he said . Last year , the Task Force on Judicial Impeachment held evidentiary hearings that led to unanimous approval of the four articles of impeachment , citing evidence that Porteous `` intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury , engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme , solicited and accepted unlawful gifts , and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings , '' the House release said . Porteous was appointed to the federal bench in 1994 . In 2007 , after an FBI and federal grand jury investigation , the Justice Department alleged `` pervasive misconduct '' by Porteous and evidence `` that Judge Porteous may have violated federal and state criminal laws , controlling canons of judicial conduct , rules of professional responsibility , and conducted himself in a manner antithetical to the constitutional standard of good behavior required of all federal judges . '' The complaint said the department opted not to seek criminal charges for reasons that included issues of statute of limitations and other factors . But Westling said the statute of limitations was not applicable . An Impeachment Task Force held four hearings late last year that focused on allegations of misconduct by Porteous , including : -- Involvement in a corrupt kickback scheme -- Failure to recuse himself from a case he was involved in -- Allegations that Porteous made false and misleading statements , including concealing debts and gambling losses -- Allegations that Porteous asked for and accepted `` numerous things of value , including meals , trips , home and car repairs , for his personal use and benefit '' while taking official actions on behalf of his benefactors -- Allegations that Porteous lied about his past to the U.S. Senate and to the FBI about his nomination to the federal bench `` in order to conceal corrupt relationships , '' Schiff said in his floor statement as prepared for delivery Porteous was invited to testify , but he declined to do so , Schiff said . `` His long-standing pattern of corrupt activity , so utterly lacking in honesty and integrity , demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court judge , '' he said . Porteous , 63 , has not worked as a judge since he was suspended with pay in the fall of 2008 , Westling said . The last federal judge impeachment occurred last year , when Judge Samuel B. Kent of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas resigned after being impeached on charges of sexual assault , obstructing and impeding an official proceeding , and making false and misleading statements , according to the Web site of the Federal Judicial Center . The Senate , sitting as a court of impeachment , dismissed the articles . Before then , Judge Walter L. Nixon of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi was impeached in 1989 on charges of perjury before a federal grand jury . The Senate convicted him and removed him from office that year .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The current debate over controversial interrogation practices -- tactics that some say constitute torture -- is rooted in the early years of the fight against terrorism and the Iraq war . The photographs from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq sparked outrage across the globe . After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States , the Bush administration crafted the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques of prisoners and terrorism suspects . The techniques included keeping the prisoner in stress positions for extended periods of time , sleep deprivation , slapping , enclosing the prisoner in a box with insects , and waterboarding , which simulates drowning . Those techniques were detailed in four Bush-era legal memos -- one from 2002 and three from 2005 -- released by the Obama administration last month . The memos concluded that such techniques did not constitute torture and were not illegal . See timeline of events '' The Obama administration disagrees . President Obama formally banned the techniques by issuing an executive order requiring that the U.S. Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations . `` I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture , '' he said during an address to a joint session of Congress in February . More than 400 people have been disciplined based on investigations involving detainee abuse , according to Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman . He said the punishments have ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand . `` The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat prisoners humanely , and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined , '' he said . The most notorious of the cases centered on Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . In 2004 , images leaked to the media showed U.S. troops abusing Iraqi prisoners . Some prisoners were stacked atop each other while naked , and others were being threatened by dogs . See disturbing images from Abu Ghraib -LRB- discretion advised -RRB- '' One widely disseminated photograph showed an Iraqi prisoner hooded and wired , as if an electrocution were about to take place . Eleven American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses , and some officers were reprimanded . Some received prison sentences . Janis Karpinski , a brigadier general and commander of the prison during the time the photographs were taken , was demoted to colonel . She was eventually rotated out of Iraq . The prison was shut down in September 2006 . Karpinksi , now retired , said the recent disclosures have validated her earlier claims that she and her troops were following orders and that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not simply the work of a few `` bad apples , '' as once described by then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . See gallery of key players '' `` That is what we have been saying from the very beginning , that , wait a minute , why are you inside pointing the finger at me ? Why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here ? There 's a bigger story here , '' Karpinski said . `` I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations , but I read the memorandums many times over , '' she added . `` Waterboarding is torture . '' Other recent disclosures of harsh interrogation tactics have also raised questions . One Bush-era memo -- dated May 30 , 2005 , and recently released by the Obama administration -- said CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects . The technique was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah , according to the memo . Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- said to be the mastermind of the September 11 attacks -- 183 times in March 2003 , the memo said . Obama said last week that he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos , and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned . `` Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time , '' Obama said in a statement . `` This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States . '' However , Obama recently reversed course on the court-ordered release of hundreds of additional images said to show abuse in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq . He argued that the photos could `` inflame anti-American opinion '' and have `` a chilling effect '' on further investigations of detainee abuse . The photos `` are not particularly sensational , especially when compared to the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib , '' he said last week . The Obama administration said last month that it would not object to the release of the photos . The images are from more than 60 criminal investigations into detainee abuse between 2001 through 2006 , Pentagon officials said . The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union . `` Essentially , by withholding these photographs from public view , the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration 's torture policies , '' ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said . Bush-era officials , especially former Vice President Dick Cheney , have defended the controversial interrogation tactics , arguing that they helped provide valuable information in the fight against terrorism and other conflicts . `` I know specifically of reports that I read , '' Cheney told Fox News last month , `` that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . '' The Obama administration `` did n't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort , '' he said . The memos ' release has added momentum to the debate over whether Bush administration officials ought to be prosecuted for authorizing such policies . Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would decide whether to investigate Bush administration officials who formed the legal basis for the techniques . The Obama administration has said that CIA interrogators who followed the instructions would not be prosecuted for their work . `` We are going to follow the evidence , follow the law and take that where it leads , '' Holder said . `` No one is above the law .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home , a medical examiner said Tuesday . Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his family in June . Dr. Kris Sperry , Georgia 's chief medical examiner , said the body of Benoit 's wife , Nancy , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs . Sperry said it 's likely the Benoits ' 7-year-old son , Daniel , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy 's system . Xanax is not normally prescribed for children , Sperry said . Chris Benoit 's body contained an `` elevated '' level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , Sperry said . But , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death . `` There 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , '' Sperry said . `` The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , '' he said . `` It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency . '' The investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in Benoit 's body . The investigation into the Benoits ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called '' ` roid rage , '' leading him to kill his wife and son . An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy . The Orlando , Florida , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids . Phil Astin , Benoit 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs . Astin has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest . Although Benoit 's name was not mentioned in Astin 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths . `` Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville , Georgia , Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4 , 2006 , through May 9 , 2007 , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone . Nancy Benoit 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body `` could come from the decomposition process . '' Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel 's body . Daniel 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but Sperry could not speculate why . District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths , which he said is ongoing . `` We 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , '' he said . `` We 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household . This -LRB- the toxicology report -RRB- adds one element to all the other elements .

{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq 's government has authorized Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to submit to Washington amendments to a draft security agreement with the United States , an Iraqi government spokesman said Tuesday . Students protest the status-of-forces agreement Tuesday at Baghdad 's Mustansiriya University . Ali al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government approved several amendments that were `` necessary , essential and appropriate '' to the draft status-of-forces agreement , which would set the terms for U.S. troops in Iraq after the United Nations mandate on their presence expires at the end of this year . `` The Iraqi government authorizes the prime minister to bring up these amendments to the U.S. side in order to reach a draft agreement that will preserve the fundamental principles and the sovereignty of Iraq and its high interests , '' al-Dabbagh said . It is unclear when al-Maliki will submit the changes to the draft document . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently said that there was `` great reluctance '' to make any more changes to the agreement . However , senior U.S. officials -- speaking under the condition of anonymity -- are not ruling out possibly renegotiating parts of the deal with Iraq if the country 's parliament does not approve it . The most vocal opponent of the draft security deal in Iraq has been the political party of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , which opposes any U.S. military presence in Iraq . U.S. military helicopters Tuesday flew over Baghdad 's Mustansiriya University , where hundreds of students took part in a demonstration organized by the Sadr movement against the status-of-forces deal . `` We are against this agreement between the Iraqi government and between the American government because it is against Iraqi sovereignty , '' said law student Ahmed Fadhil Abbas , one of the demonstrators . Fellow demonstrator and law student Hisham Mohammed said the students plan to organize a sit-in and a strike across universities in Iraq to protest the agreement . The draft status-of-forces agreement , according to a copy obtained by CNN , calls for U.S. combat troops to be out of Iraqi cities and villages by July 30 , 2009 , and out of the country entirely by December 31 , 2011 . The agreement allows for an earlier withdrawal or an extension of the U.S. forces ' stay in Iraq , by agreement of both parties . It also allows the Iraqi government to ask `` the United States government to leave certain forces for training and for support purposes for the Iraqi forces . '' Legal jurisdiction over U.S. forces in Iraq has been a sticking point in the negotiation , with the U.S. side preferring that its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law . Baghdad had sought the power to arrest and try Americans accused of crimes not related to official military operations , plus jurisdiction over troops and contractors who commit major crimes in the course of their duties . Under the draft agreement , U.S. forces or contractors who commit `` major and premeditated murders '' while off duty and outside U.S. facilities would fall under Iraqi jurisdiction , according to the copy obtained by CNN . All other crimes -- and murders committed inside U.S. facilities or by on-duty forces -- would fall under American jurisdiction , the agreement says .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The world 's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011 , the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and , in many cases , the poorest nations , a report released Wednesday said . Riders cram into a train last month in New Delhi , India . India 's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050 . A staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia , Africa , Latin America and the Caribbean , according to the Population Reference Bureau 's 2009 World Population Data Sheet . `` The great bulk of today 's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries , '' said Carl Haub , a co-author of the report . Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia . `` During the next few decades , these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities , gainful employment , and adequate health care , '' Haub continued , calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades . In the developed world , the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths , according to the report . High fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth , especially in Africa , where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime , the report says . The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada . A stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada , which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents , respectively . By 2050 , Canada 's population is projected to be 42 million , while Uganda 's is expected to soar to 96 million , more than tripling . `` Even with declining fertility rates in many countries , world population is still growing at a rapid rate , '' said Bill Butz , president of the bureau . `` The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years , as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama said Wednesday night he will work with Congress and the military to repeal the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy that bars gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces . Obama made the remark in his first State of the Union speech during a short litany of civil rights issues , which included his successful hate crimes bill , a move to `` crack down on equal-pay laws '' and improvement of the immigration system . `` We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution : the notion that we are all created equal , that no matter who you are or what you look like , if you abide by the law you should be protected by it , '' he said . `` We must continually renew this promise . My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination . We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate , '' he said . `` This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . '' Weigh in on the president 's address Former Navy pilot Sen . John McCain said `` it would be a mistake '' to repeal the 1993 law that bars gay men and lesbians from revealing their sexual orientation , and prevents the military from asking about it . `` This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years , and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels , '' McCain said . `` We have the best-trained , best-equipped , and most professional force in the history of our country , and the men and women in uniform are performing heroically in two wars . At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield , now is not the time to abandon the policy . '' But in a message to Pentagon leadership , Gen. John Shalikashvili , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said it 's time to repeal the law . `` As a nation built on the principal of equality , we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military , '' said Shalikashvili . His letter was sent to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D-New York , who supports repealing the policy . The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , an organization that works with those affected by the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' law , praised Obama 's call for repeal . `` We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010 , '' the group said . `` We call on the president to repeal the archaic 1993 law in his defense budget currently being drafted , that is probably the only and best moving bill where DADT can be killed this year . ... The American public , including conservatives , is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one . '' House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , flatly disagreed with the idea of ending it . `` When it comes to ` do n't ask do n't tell , ' frankly , I think it 's worked very well . And we just ought to leave it alone , '' he said to reporters Wednesday morning . The policy prohibits openly gay men and women from serving in the U.S. armed forces . The policy bans military recruiters or authorities from asking about an individual 's sexual orientation but also prohibits a service member from revealing that he or she is gay . Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , D-Michigan , supports ending the practice but wants to go about it carefully . Levin said he did not have any details about what the president would say . `` If we do this in a way which is n't sensitive ... we could have exactly the opposite effect of what I hope will be the case -- which is to change the policy , '' he said Monday . Levin said the committee plans to hold hearings on the issue in early February , although the hearing may be with outside experts -- delaying a hearing with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen , that had originally been promised , CNN was told by a congressional source . Obama campaigned on the promise that he would repeal the law in his first year of office . Speaking to the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign , in October , Obama admitted that `` our progress may be taking longer than we like , '' but he insisted his administration was still on track to overturn the policy . `` Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach , '' he said . Pentagon Spokesman Geoff Morrell deflected repeated questions about the policy at Wednesday 's Pentagon briefing , directing reporters to take their questions to the White House . `` We continue to work on this problem , '' said Morrell . `` But I 'm not going to get into it with more specificity than that .

Of the 4,000 U.S. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in non-hostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides . Eight of the 4,000 killed were civilians working for the Pentagon . Many of those killed over the years , like the four soldiers slain on Sunday in Baghdad , have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize Iraq 's tenacious insurgency . The existence of the Pentagon 's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization has been developed to counter the threat of IEDs in Iraq as well as Afghanistan . The group calls IEDs the `` weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists . '' Watch how IEDs have become deadly staple in Iraq war '' Meanwhile , estimates of the Iraqi death toll range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands , with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 2.5 million people displaced within Iraq , according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . President Bush ordered U.S. troops into Iraq on March 19 , 2003 , after months of warnings that then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb . U.N. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion , and the CIA later concluded that Iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s . Hussein 's government fell in early April 2003 , and Iraq 's new government executed him in December 2006 . The news of the 4,000 mark came on the same day that Iraq 's national security adviser urged Americans to be patient with the progress of the war , contending that it is `` well worth fighting '' because it has implications about `` global terror . '' `` This is global terrorism hitting everywhere , and they have chosen Iraq to be a battlefield . And we have to take them on , '' Mowaffak al-Rubaie said Sunday on CNN 's `` Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . '' `` If we do n't prevail , if we do n't succeed in this war , then we are doomed forever , '' he said . `` I understand and sympathize with the mothers , with the widows , with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country . `` But honestly , it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in Iraq . '' Nearly 160,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq , and the war has cost U.S. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the House Budget Committee . The conflict is now widely unpopular among Americans : A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. poll out Wednesday found only 32 percent of Americans support the conflict . And 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most U.S. troops within a few months of taking office . In the weekly Democratic radio address Saturday , Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey said President Bush `` took us to war on the wings of a lie . '' Menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the U.S. military ; diverted national attention away from the war in Afghanistan , where al Qaeda is regrouping ; and hurt the hunt for Osama bin Laden . The Iraq war has not made Americans safer , Menendez said , but has instead hurt the U.S. economy . The senator called for a `` responsible new direction '' regarding Iraq . CNN learned last week , from several U.S. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record , that senior U.S. military officials are preparing to recommend to Bush a four - to six-week `` pause '' in additional troop withdrawals from Iraq after the last of the `` surge '' brigades leaves in July . `` If the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause , then we will have to have a pause , '' al-Rubaie said . The return of all five brigades added to the Iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000 , but still leave approximately 130,000 or more troops in Iraq . Al-Rubaie emphasized Sunday that any drawdown of U.S. troops `` has to be based on the conditions on the ground . '' `` It depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces , and the preparedness of the Iraqi security forces , '' he said . `` This should not be a purely political decision . It should be also a technical , military and intelligence decision . '' But there has been too much `` foot-dragging on key governance questions in Iraq , '' Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said on CNN on Sunday . `` It seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals , you send exactly the wrong message to the Iraqis . '' On Wednesday , Bush will visit the Pentagon to be briefed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , chaired by Adm. Michael Mullen . The American troop level in Iraq `` depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of Iraq and the United States government , '' al-Rubaie said . When conditions warrant the withdrawal of American troops , the Iraqis will say '' ` Thank you very much , indeed , ' '' al-Rubaie said . `` A big , big thank you for the United States of America for liberating Iraq , for helping us in sustaining the security gains in Iraq ... and we will give them a very , very good farewell party then . '' Responding to recent remarks from U.S. presidential candidates that Iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future , al-Rubaie said Iraqis are making political and security gains . `` Literally by the day and by the week , we are gradually assuming more responsibility , '' he said , noting that Iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces .

{"answer":"KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two separate militant assaults Saturday in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika led to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and at least 42 insurgents , military officials said . U.S. Marines , under fire from a building , move to take it Saturday in Helmand province , Afghanistan . The soldiers died when Taliban fighters attacked a base in Zerok that houses members of the U.S. military , Afghan national police and Afghan National Army , said the provincial governor 's spokesman , Hamidullah Zawak . He said the Taliban first detonated a truck full of explosives , then attacked the base with missiles and rockets . The military responded by sending in aircraft and dropping bombs , killing 32 Taliban fighters and wounding many , Zawak said , without giving a number . Seven of the wounded Taliban fighters were arrested . Zawak said one U.S. soldier was killed and another wounded . Sgt. Chuck Marsh , however , a U.S. military spokesman , said two U.S. service members were killed and four wounded . Two soldiers from the Afghan National Army were also hurt , Zawak said . A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul . Several hours later , at least 10 militants were killed and one detained in an assault on a combat outpost in the province . Insurgents attacked with indirect fire , including multiple rockets and mortars -- at least one of which contained white phosphorous -- small-arms fire and a car bomb , according to a statement from NATO 's International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudan 's government and rebels from its troubled Darfur region signed a confidence-building agreement Tuesday in Qatar , a step toward ending a six-year conflict that has killed about 300,000 people , the emirate 's state news agency reported . A member of the Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007 . Detailed talks between the government and the Justice and Equality Movement are scheduled to begin in two weeks after Tuesday 's signing , Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr al-Thani , Qatar 's prime minister , told the SUNA news agency . Roger Middleton , an Africa specialist at the British think-tank Chatham House , said Tuesday 's agreement deals mostly with prisoner releases . But he said the two parties ' decision to hold further talks `` is an important move forward , which there has n't necessarily been in the past . '' `` It is certainly a step in the right direction , '' he said . `` But a lot more needs to be done if we 're going to see a full cessation of fighting in Darfur . '' Other rebel groups are not included in the pact , and `` many , many things '' could cause the talks to fail , he said . `` It is a start , but it 's very fragile , and we must n't get overexcited just yet , '' Middleton said . In November , Sudan 's President Omar al-Bashir agreed to an immediate , unconditional cease-fire in Darfur , but JEM was not included in the talks . Sudan 's Culture Minister Amin Hassan Omar and Jibril Ibrahim , a top rebel official , signed Tuesday 's agreement . Qatar has been mediating talks between the two sides in the Darfur conflict , which erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government . The government launched a brutal counter-insurgency campaign , aided by government-backed Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents , according to the United Nations , Western governments and human rights organizations . Al-Bashir is under pressure to end the fighting , particularly because he was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court last year for the government 's campaign of violence in Darfur . In the past six years , an estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat , disease or malnutrition , the United Nations says . An additional 2.7 million people fled their homes because of fighting among rebels , government forces and allied militias .","question":""}

{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The autopsy on Corey Haim revealed the actor 's heart was enlarged and his lungs were filled with water when he died , Haim 's manager said . The Los Angeles County coroner told Haim 's mother that her son suffered from pulmonary congestion , manager Mark Heaslip said . Heaslip said this was evidence that Haim 's death was not caused by a drug overdose , but Brian Elias with the coroner 's office said they are waiting for toxicology tests before deciding what killed Haim . The 1980s teen movie actor , who struggled for decades with drug addiction , died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother , authorities said . Longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman asked Wednesday that people not `` jump the gun '' to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim . Heaslip , manager to both Feldman and Haim , said he seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death . Haim , 38 , was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank , California , early Wednesday , where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. PT -LRB- 5:15 a.m. ET -RRB- , said Ed Winter , Los Angeles County deputy coroner . Haim was in the apartment he shared with his mother , Judy Haim , when he `` became a little dizzy , he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom , '' Winter said . `` His mom assisted him in the bed . He became unresponsive . '' His mother called paramedics to the apartment , which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank , he said . Haim had suffered from flulike symptoms for two days , the deputy coroner said . `` We found no illicit drugs . However , we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location , '' Winter said , adding he does not know what those drugs were . Haim was `` weaned down to literally zero medications '' in the past two weeks by an addiction specialist , Heaslip said on HLN 's `` Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell '' on Wednesday . The doctor `` put him on a new line of medications , '' Feldman said on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' on Wednesday . Feldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose . He said that until the autopsy report is issued , `` nobody knows and nobody 's going to know . '' Watch Corey Feldman talk about his friend 's death on `` Larry King Live '' `` I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things , '' Feldman said . `` This could have been a kidney failure . This could have been a heart failure . '' Heaslip that said Haim 's mother , Judy , told him `` there were no signs of him overdosing . '' His death came as his career was picking up , with Haim booking `` movie after movie , '' Heaslip said . His latest film is set for release soon , he said . Haim `` really became a man '' in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer , Feldman said . `` He 's been there for her , taking care of her , being responsible , '' he said . Feldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry . He was broke , without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother , he said . `` We build people up as children , we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore , we walk away from them , '' he said . Haim 's most famous role was in the 1987 movie `` The Lost Boys , '' in which he appeared with Feldman . Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire . In later years , the two friends -- who appeared in eight movies together -- struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways . They reunited for a reality show , `` The Two Coreys , '' in 2007 , but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year . In a 2007 interview on CNN 's `` Larry King Live , '' Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs . Feldman told King that he had gotten clean , but it took Haim longer . Haim called himself `` a chronic relapser for the rest of my life . '' `` I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything , '' he said . `` I mean , I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes , which is why I have a support group around me consistently . '' In 2008 , Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober . In a clip from `` The Two Coreys , '' Feldman and his wife , along with two other former teen stars , called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help , the magazine said . The meeting followed an incident in which Haim , scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to `` The Lost Boys , '' appeared on the set `` clearly under the influence , '' People reported . Feldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction . Haim was born December 23 , 1971 , in Toronto , Ontario , according to a biography on his Web site . He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series `` The Edison Twins . '' His first film role was in the 1984 movie `` First Born . '' Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film `` Lucas . '' Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time , `` If he continues to act this well , he will never become a half-forgotten child star , but will continue to grow into an important actor .

{"answer":"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared in the past three months and is now at 11.2 million percent , the highest in the world , according to the country 's Central Statistical Office . Zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared to a world high . Official figures dated Monday show inflation has surged from the rate of 2.2 million percent recorded in May , despite the government 's price controls . The country 's finance minister confirmed the new figure in an interview but said the rising inflation rate was not confined to Zimbabwe alone . `` While our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the Western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio-fuel , '' said Samuel Mumbengegwi . `` But we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic . '' In February , the price of a loaf of bread in the country was less than 200,000 Zimbabwe dollars . On Monday , that same loaf of bread cost 1.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars . Analysts have said the Zimbabwean government 's official inflation rate figures are conservative . Last week , one of Zimbabwe 's leading banks , Kingdom Bank , said the country 's inflation rate was now more than 20 million percent . The locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for Zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment in an economy that has been in freefall for almost a decade . Once considered the breadbasket of Africa , Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the country embarked on a chaotic land reform program that has decimated commercial agriculture . Analysts say the crisis has worsened following President Robert Mugabe 's disputed reelection in the June 27 presidential run-off . His challenger Morgan Tsvangirai boycotted the race over widespread allegations of violence and voter intimidation . The economic crisis has destroyed Zimbabwe 's currency and made it difficult for Zimbabweans to buy basic commodities , electricity , fuel , and medicines . Many Zimbabweans have left the country amid rising unemployment and deepening poverty . Last week a summit in South Africa of regional African leaders failed to persuade Zimbabwe 's political parties to agree to form a government of national unity , which observers view as the best way to end Zimbabwe 's record recession .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A double amputee sprinter has won the right to be eligible to compete at this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing after sport 's highest court backed his appeal against a ban imposed by athletics authorities . Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorious competed in two able-bodied athletics meetings in 2007 . The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that South African Oscar Pistorius , who runs on prosthetic blades , is eligible to compete against able-bodied athletes . Pistorius , 21 , who lost both legs below the knees when he was a baby , runs on shock-absorbing carbon-fiber prosthetics that resemble bent skis -- earning him the nickname `` Blade Runner . '' Pistorius , a Paralympic Games champion and world record holder , had lobbied the International Association of Athletics Federations -LRB- IAAF -RRB- to allow him to compete at the Olympics this August , but after extensive tests the IAAF ruled in January that his J-shaped prosthetics qualify as technical aids , which are banned in IAAF-governed sports . The IAAF does allow athletes with prosthetics to compete in able-bodied sports , as long as the IAAF believes they do not give the athlete an unfair edge . But Friday 's ruling by the CAS in Lausanne , Switzerland , overturned that verdict . In a statement , it said that its panel had `` not been persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of a double-amputee '' using Pistorius ' blades . Appeals of court decisions are allowed , but on very limited grounds . But the CAS said it did not exclude the possibility that future scientific tests could be developed which might enable the IAAF to prove that the blades provided Pistorius with an advantage over able-bodied athletes . The South African won gold in the 200 meters , and bronze in the 100 meters at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens . He holds the Paralympic world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters . Since Athens , he has competed in two able-bodied races in which he finished second and last , respectively . Pistorius will have emphasized to the court the disadvantages he feels he has by running with prosthetics , CNN World Sport 's Don Riddell said . `` There are disadvantages when it 's windy , when it 's raining , -LRB- and -RRB- it takes him longer to get up to speed at the start , '' Riddell said . `` He will be hoping that they take everything into consideration and not just rule on how much spring his prosthetic limbs give him . '' In November , the IAAF carried out tests on Pistorius over two days at the German Sport University in Cologne to determine if his prosthetics , known as Cheetah limbs , could be considered a technical aid . A team of more than 10 scientists used high-speed cameras , special equipment to measure ground-reaction forces , and a three-dimensional scanner to record body mass . The scientists concluded Pistorius was able to run with his prosthetic blades at the same speed as able-bodied sprinters with about 25 percent less energy expenditure . Pistorius ' blades gave him an energy return nearly three times higher than the human ankle joint offers in maximum sprinting , they said . Riddell described Friday 's ruling in Pistorius ' favor as `` groundbreaking , '' and said it raised questions about the future of paralympic sports . `` What does this do to the future of the Paralympics if he 's allowed to run in the able-bodied Olympics ? Is he actually doing a disservice to other Paralympic athletes ? Does it cheapen the Paralympic Games ? '' Riddell asked .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former federal prosecutor was arrested Wednesday on charges related to the murder of a witness in a drug case , among many other counts , the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Newark , New Jersey , said . Former federal prosecutor Paul Bergrin is charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included a murder . Paul Bergrin and three others were taken into custody after a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted them on 14 counts , including murder , racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering charges , a statement from Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. said . The indictment charges Bergrin with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included the murder of a witness in a drug case and an attempt to hire a hit man in another drug case , the statement said . Bergrin also is charged with wire fraud and money laundering , Marra said . Gerald Shargel , Bergrin 's attorney , said his client would plead not guilty to all charges . `` This is largely dredging up old issues , and we intend to vigorously fight the charges , '' Shargel said . The U.S. Attorney 's Office statement said Bergrin was involved in the murder of a confidential witness in one federal drug case and tried to hire a Chicago , Illinois , hit man to kill a witness in another drug case . The second killing never occurred , the statement said , because the proposed hit man was a cooperating witness in the case . Marra called Bergrin 's alleged conduct `` simply shocking . '' `` A licensed lawyer , a former prosecutor essentially became one of the criminals he represents , supporting , encouraging , indeed directing , a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder and murder conspiracies , drug trafficking and financial fraud , '' Marra said in the statement . `` Bergrin can now expect to feel the full weight of the very legal system he turned on its head with his conduct . '' Bergrin was an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey before going into private practice . According to the New York Law Journal , Bergrin , 53 , pleaded guilty this month to two misdemeanor counts for his involvement with a prostitution ring . He later represented U.S. Army Sgt. Javal Davis , one of seven people charged in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq . In that case , Davis entered a plea agreement on reduced charges before his court martial began . A recorded message at Bergrin 's Newark , New Jersey , office said it was closed today , and messages left with Bergrin 's cell phone and the cell phones of two associates went unanswered .","question":""}
{"answer":"Editor 's note : Kathleen Sebelius is secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration . Kathleen Sebelius says health care costs are a huge and growing burden on the economy . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Today in Washington , some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we should n't tackle health care reform . Nothing could be further from the truth . With more and more of America 's families , businesses , and local , state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care , health care reform has never been more important . As President Obama has often said , you ca n't fix the economy without fixing health care . Unless we fix what is broken in our current system , everyone 's health care will be in jeopardy . Health care reform is not a luxury . It is a necessity . It 's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand . Today , we have by far the most expensive health system in the world . We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . We spend more on health care than housing or food , the McKinsey Global Institute reported . Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured , millions more are underinsured , and they are n't the only ones who are suffering . The high cost of care is hurting all of us . A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than $ 1,000 every year . The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums , taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans . Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000 , and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits . Nationwide , health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product . If we continue on our current path , health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040 , and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million , according to the Council of Economic Advisers . Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care , we are n't healthier . Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates . Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries . More than one-third of Americans are obese . These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable . They also show us the high cost of doing nothing . If we choose the status quo , more Americans will be uninsured , costs will continue to rise , and every American 's health care will be at risk . Inaction is not an option , and reform is long overdue . The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families , businesses and government ; protect people 's choice of doctors , hospitals and health plans ; and assure affordable , quality health care for all Americans . We are guided by a simple principle : Protect what works about health care and fix what 's broken , and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit . The president has already introduced proposals that will provide $ 950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform . Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse . We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options , and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform . But we are not open to deficit spending . Health care reform will be paid for , and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years . Working together , we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable , quality coverage they need . And we know they do not want us to wait . Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it . For years , the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge . They have waited long enough . The time for reform is now . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The biggest surprise on a busy night of international football on Wednesday came in Duesseldorf , where Euro 2008 finalists Germany were beaten by Norway for the first time in 73 years . Norway players celebrate Christian Grindheim 's -LRB- No. 16 -RRB- goal in their shock victory over Germany . Midfielder Christian Grindheim scored from close-range , from Morten Gamst Pedersen 's cross , in the 63rd minute to give the visitors a 1-0 victory to stun the 45,000 home supporters on a freezing evening . Not since the 1936 Olympics in Berlin had Germany lost to Norway -- the defeat even more suprising as Germany coach Joachim Loew had the luxury of naming a full-strength side , while new Norway coach Egil Olsen was missing seven key players . In Marseille , Lionel Messi scored a brilliant solo goal to give Argentina a 2-0 win over France and give Diego Maradona a second straight win as national coach . The Barcelona striker collected the ball outside the penalty area and ran right through the home defense before expertly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Steve Mandanda . Newcastle winger Jonas Gutierrez had opened the scoring four minutes before the interval with a shot that went inside Mandanda 's left-hand post . Meanwhile , Jamel Saihi scored a second-half equalizer to give home side Tunisia a 1-1 draw with the Netherlands in Rades . Montpellier star Saihi netted midway through the second-half with a long-range shot that Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg should have saved . Klaas Jan Huntelaar has given the visitors the lead in the 62nd minute when converting his 11th goal in 19 internationals , after Joris Mathijsen had headed down a long ball from Stijn Schaars . Elsewhere , Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva returned to action for the first time since breaking his leg 12 months ago -- helping Croatia to a 2-1 victory over Romania in Bucharest . Eduardo , who fractured his left fibula and dislocated his ankle against Birmingham in February 2008 , replaced Ivica Olic in the 61st minute and set up Niko Kranjcar for a 75th-minute winner . Ciprian Marica gave Romania the lead in the 22nd minute but the visitors levelled just six minutes later when Ivan Rakitic scored with a superb long-range free-kick . Unsettled Chelsea striker Didier Drogba scored an injury-time equalizer to give Ivory Coast a 1-1 draw with Turkey in Izmir .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California corrections officials released a startling new prison mug shot of Grammy-winning music legend Phil Spector , convicted last month of second-degree murder and serving 19 years to life in prison . Phil Spector 's prison mug shot , taken June 5 , shows him without a hairpiece . Spector , 69 , is being held at North Kern State Prison , where he is being evaluated before receiving a permanent prison assignment , corrections spokesman Gordon Hinkle said . The process could take up to 70 days . The mug shot , which shows a bald-pated Spector , was taken on June 5 as part of the routine intake process . California prison inmates are not permitted to wear wigs under Title 15 , Article 5 , Section 3062 of the state 's prison regulations , which addresses inmate hygiene . Corrections officials also are concerned that wigs can be used to hide contraband . A judge in Los Angeles sentenced Spector last month to the maximum sentence for second-degree murder in the February 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson . Spector , 69 , wo n't be eligible for parole until he is 88 years old . Clarkson , 40 , was found dead , slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector 's Alhambra mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth . View a timeline of the case '' Spector 's retrial began in October and ended in April . It took jurors 30 hours to convict him . His first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial when the jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in favor of conviction after 15 days of deliberations . Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie `` Barbarian Queen '' and appeared in many other films , including `` Deathstalker , '' `` Blind Date , '' `` Scarface , '' `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High '' and the spoof `` Amazon Women on the Moon . '' She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood 's House of Blues at the time of her death . At both trials , Spector 's attorneys argued Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and her flagging Hollywood career . They said she grabbed a .38 - caliber pistol and killed herself while at Spector 's home . But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace . Five women took the stand and testified he threatened them with firearms . His driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw Spector leave the home , pistol in hand , saying , `` I think I killed somebody . '' Spector 's professional trademark was the `` Wall of Sound , '' the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label , named for Spector and his business partner , Lester Sill , in the early 1960s .

{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A funeral procession for a senior Iraqi Shiite leader wound through the streets of Tehran , the Iranian capital , on Thursday . Iraqi Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim , seen in a 2007 photo , was an ally of both the U.S. and Iran . Mourners turned out to say goodbye to Abdul Aziz al-Hakim , who spent 20 years in exile in Iran before returning to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . The funeral procession started at the Iraqi Embassy in Tehran , said Haitham al-Husseini , a senior official with al-Hakim 's office and one of his advisers . Iraqi and Iranian government officials attended the procession with senior religious figures and some members of the Iraqi parliament . Another funeral procession is scheduled to be held Friday in Baghdad , Iraq , before the casket travels to several parts of southern Iraq with large Shiite populations . Authorities are concerned about security since Sunni insurgents have targeted large Shiite gatherings in the past . The Iraqi government announced the start of three days of mourning on Thursday , according to state television in Iraq . Al-Hakim died Wednesday in Tehran after a lengthy battle with lung cancer . He was 59 . He will be buried in his hometown of Najaf , one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims , al-Husseini said . U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. Ray Odierno , described him as `` a national hero '' in a joint statement that expressed sadness over the death . `` Throughout his life , His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude , contributing to the building of a new Iraq , '' the statement said . `` We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues . Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered condolences , saying al-Hakim was `` like an old brother . '' Al-Maliki credited him for being a `` strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq . '' Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq 's future '' `` His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq , '' al-Maliki said . Al-Hakim ended his exile in Iran in 2003 when he returned to Iraq after Hussein and his regime were toppled . `` It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell , '' al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview . `` I was longing to see them , my goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them . '' Iraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime , which favored the country 's minority Sunni Muslims . Al-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq 's future following his return . During his exile , which began in the early 1980s , al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades , the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq , or SCIRI . SCIRI -- a religious opposition movement to the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim 's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003 . Al-Hakim himself was also the target of assassination attempts . He took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq 's predominantly Shiite south . SCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq -LRB- ISCI -RRB- in 2007 to remove the word `` revolution , '' in an effort to reflect the situation in Iraq . Al-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace , calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Hussein . But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq , he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion , religious institutions and its authorities . Al-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura , a national day of fasting , and turned them into a powerful political platform . That ability led some to consider him Iraq 's most powerful man . His political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi Parliament in 2005 . And although al-Hakim never held a government position , he commanded respect from those who did . Government ministers would meet with him at his office , not theirs , and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad . And when talks on Iraq 's constitution stalled , former President George W. Bush called al-Hakim , not the Iraqi prime minister or president . He visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq . But al-Hakim remained artfully vague about Iran 's influence in Iraq , saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government , which raised concerns about what it called Iran 's `` meddling . '' He said the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries shared border , historical and cultural relations , and emphasized the desire for strong ties . Al-Hakim died at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq . The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq -LRB- ISCI -RRB- party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he wanted to serve . Al-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007 and was first treated in the United States , then later in Iran . When he returned to Iraq later that year , he told CNN that he felt good . But it was around that time that it became apparent he was grooming his son , Ammar al-Hakim , to take over as head of ISCI . It was once Iraq 's most powerful Shiite political party , but ISCI lost much of its influence following elections in January when politicians allied with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki won control of most of Iraq 's provincial councils .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health , according to a statement from his doctor , released by the campaign . Besides being an `` intermittent smoker , '' Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health , his doctor says . Obama , 46 , last saw Dr. David Scheiner in January 2007 , shortly before he declared he was running for president . Scheiner , who has been Obama 's primary doctor since 1987 , observed that the Illinois senator 's diet , weight , blood pressure and cholesterol were all healthy . `` In short , his examination showed him to be in excellent health , '' Scheiner said . Obama `` exercised regularly , often jogging three miles . His diet was balanced with good intake of roughage and fluids . ... On physical examination , his blood pressure was 90\/60 and pulse 60\/minute , '' Scheiner wrote . The Illinois senator has been an `` intermittent '' cigarette smoker who has `` quit on several occasions and is currently using Nicorette gum with success . '' Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president , released his health records last week . McCain 's doctors also described him as being in `` excellent health , '' despite a history of skin cancer , and said there appears to be no physical reason why the 71-year-old candidate could not carry out the duties of the office . Obama released a one-page statement from his primary care physician . He did not release any medical records or make his doctors available to the media . By contrast , McCain made more than 1,000 pages of medical documents available to journalists , including CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta . Four of McCain 's doctors held a conference call with reporters after the records were made available . McCain has had four malignant melanomas removed . Three of them -- on his left shoulder , left arm and left nasal wall -- were limited to the top skin layer and were not invasive . They were removed in 1993 , 2000 and 2002 . But a fourth melanoma proved to be invasive and was removed from his left lower temple in 2000 , said Dr. John D. Eckstein , an internist who has been overseeing McCain 's treatment for 16 years at the Mayo Clinic 's campus in Scottsdale , Arizona .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama introduced a health care plan that he says will bridge the gap between the House and Senate bills passed last year . His proposal is similar to the Senate bill , with a few nods to the House plan . Here are some of the highlights of his plan , according to the White House . Basics The president says his health care proposal will help more than 31 million uninsured Americans get coverage . Obama says his plan includes the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history . It establishes a health insurance market that would provide the same insurance choices that members of Congress have . Health insurance exchanges , as proposed in the Senate bill , would be created to make it easier for small businesses , the self-employed and the unemployed to purchase less expensive coverage . There is no public option , an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed both by Republicans and key Democratic moderates . Like the House and Senate plans , Obama 's proposal would bar insurers from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history or denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions . Key differences Obama 's plan eliminates the controversial proposal added to the Senate bill that exempts Nebraska from paying increased Medicaid expenses . It also provides additional federal financing to all of the states for the Medicaid expansion . The president 's proposal closes the Medicare prescription drug `` doughnut hole . '' Under current Medicare limits , seniors must pick up the costs once their drug costs reach $ 2,830 and pay all costs out of pocket until they reach $ 4,550 , at which point Medicare coverage kicks back in . Obama 's proposal eases the `` doughnut hole '' in the short term by providing a $ 250 rebate to Medicare beneficiaries who reach the limit in 2010 . The plan closes the doughnut hole completely by 2020 . The plan also establishes a Health Insurance Rate Authority to provide an additional level of oversight of insurance premium increase at the federal level , giving the government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies . Tax credits The president 's proposal increases federal subsidies to help people buy insurance . New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level . Compared to the Senate bill , Obama 's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $ 44,000 and $ 66,000 , according to the White House . Compared to the House bill , it lowers premiums for families making between $ 55,000 and $ 88,000 . Obama 's plan also provides more cost-sharing assistance than the House and Senate bills for families with incomes below $ 55,000 . For families making about $ 55,000 , the president 's proposal matches the assistance in the Senate bill . Penalties and fees The House and Senate bills both require payments from individuals who choose not to get health care coverage . Obama 's plan lowers the maximum penalty for individuals . Obama 's plan also provides $ 40 billion in tax credits for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees . Like the Senate bill , the president 's proposal does not mandate that employers provide insurance . Under Obama 's plan , companies with more than 50 employees would be required to pay a fee of $ 2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company 's workers receives federal health care subsidies . The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation . As with the individual requirement , this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans . Obama 's proposal delays the $ 67 billion assessment on health insurers , pushing it to 2014 , when exchanges and the new health insurance market will be set up . The president 's proposal also increases the revenue drawn from the pharmaceutical industry to $ 23 billion over the next three years -- $ 10 billion more than the Senate bill . It delays the implementation of these fees to 2011 . Waste , fraud and abuse The president 's proposal includes a number of provisions to help eliminate waste and fight fraud . Some of those provisions include establishing Medicare and Medicaid sanctions databases , increasing access to the health care integrity and protection data bank , expanding efforts to recover overpayments made to providers and suppliers , and establishing a system to more quickly identify potentially fraudulent payments . Obama 's proposal also calls for preventing delays in access to generic drugs . Questions The president 's proposal does n't address many of the sticking points that hung up the House and Senate bills . Obama says his plan also reduces the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next decade and about $ 1 trillion over the following decade by `` cutting government overspending and reining in waste , fraud and abuse . '' The White House says the plan would cost about $ 950 billion over the next 10 years , but that 's not an official estimate . There are also not a lot of specifics on how to pay for the plan . The Senate plan , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , would cost an estimated $ 871 billion ; the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost over $ 1 trillion . The Obama plan resembles the Senate version on how to block subsidies from funding abortions , choosing it over the more conservative House version . On health care and illegal immigrants , the president 's proposal follows the Senate language , which imposes far more limits on undocumented workers than the House version . Outlook Obama 's proposal is a long way from becoming law . His proposal would need to be drafted into legislation , debated and passed by the House and Senate . As the past year has shown , health care is an emotional subject , and debate can drag on for months . Immediate reaction from Republicans suggests that this time around , it wo n't be any easier . `` Nearly one year ago , the president moderated a health care summit that kicked off a national debate that has led us to where we are today : a partisan bill devoid of support from the American people and a diminished faith in this government 's capacity to listen . Let 's not make the same mistake twice , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said . House Minority Leader John Boehner revived the abortion debate , saying , `` Republicans are also standing with the American people by calling for health care reform to protect human life and not use taxpayer money to fund abortion . ... Health care reform should be an opportunity to protect human life -- not end it -- and the American people agree . '' CNN 's Lisa Desjardins , Kristi Keck and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elvis Presley may have left the building three decades ago , but he raked in more money last year than many living titans of the music industry Singer Elvis Presley tops the Forbes list for the second year in a row , raking in $ 52 million last year . For the second year in a row , Presley topped the Forbes magazine 's list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities , hauling in $ 52 million last year . In comparison , the very-much-alive Justin Timberlake earned $ 44 million while another superstar , Madonna , made $ 40 million , the magazine reported Tuesday . The 30th anniversary of Presley 's death boosted attendance and merchandise sales last year at his Memphis , Tennessee , home , Graceland . A long list of licensing deals , such as a Presley show on satellite radio , added to the earnings . The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities ' earnings since 2001 . Since 2003 , the feature has coincided with Halloween . This year , the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $ 194 million in the last 12 months . The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities ' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008 . Some celebrities are staples on the list , which is in its eighth year . Cartoonist Charles Schulz , who created Snoopy , Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of `` Peanuts '' characters , is second on the list . Schulz , who died in 2000 , had posthumous earnings last year of $ 33 million , the magazine reported . He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters , the magazine said . Schulz and Presley join Theodor `` Dr. Seuss '' Geisel -LRB- this year 's No. 6 -RRB- , Beatles legend John Lennon -LRB- No. 7 -RRB- and actress Marilyn Monroe -LRB- No. 9 -RRB- as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception .

{"answer":"JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Palestinian militant groups including the armed wing of Hamas are committing war crimes when they fire rockets into Israel , according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch . Palestinian militants from the al-Ahrar Brigades march during a rally in Gaza City in July . Three Israelis have been killed and dozens more seriously injured in Palestinian attacks since November 2008 with rockets striking populated areas up to 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- inside Israeli territory and putting 800,000 Israelis in danger , the report said . Two Palestinian girls died in Gaza when a rocket fell short of its intended target while the attacks have also put Palestinian citizens at risk from Israeli counterstrikes , it added . Human Rights Watch urged Hamas , which controls Gaza , to hold those responsible for the attacks accountable . Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union . Hamas militants have cut down on rocket strikes in the past few months , but the group has not denounced those targeting Israeli civilians , nor has it tried those behind the attacks , the New York-based watchdog said . `` Hamas rocket attacks targeting Israeli civilians are unlawful and unjustifiable , and amount to war crimes , '' said Iain Levine , program director at Human Rights Watch . `` As the governing authority in Gaza , Hamas should publicly renounce rocket attacks on Israeli civilian centers and punish those responsible , including members of its own armed wing . '' A spokesman for Hamas , Sami Abu Zuhri , criticized the report , claiming Palestinians had the right to defend themselves against Israeli military operations . `` The report is not fair , '' he said . `` It should condemn the -LRB- Israeli military -RRB- crimes instead of condemning people who defend themselves . `` The international law gives them the right to defend themselves because they are occupied . We have the right to defend our land . '' During Israel 's offensive into Gaza during December and January , Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants claimed to have fired 820 rockets at Israel , the report said . Human Rights Watch said the use of homemade Qassam and Soviet-designed Grad rockets to strike at densely populated areas amounted to indiscriminate attacks on civilians because the weapons can not be aimed with any reliability . The watchdog found no evidence that Palestinian armed groups had deliberately used civilians as shields in rocket attacks . But it said militants took insufficient precautions to avoid putting civilian lives in danger . `` Hamas forces violated the laws of war both by firing rockets deliberately or indiscriminately at Israeli cities and by launching them from populated areas and endangering Gazan civilians , '' Levine said . Human Rights Watch has also documented war violations by Israeli forces during its three-week offensive into Gaza . While Israeli military operations had been more harmful , killing hundreds of civilians with airstrikes , tank shelling and other assaults , `` violations by one party to a conflict never justify violations by the other , '' it said . `` Attacks targeting civilians are never permitted under the laws of war , which require armed forces to target only military objectives , and to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians from harm , regardless of the reasons for resorting to armed conflict . '' The United Nations is investigating violations by both sides and is due to report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in September .","question":""}
{"answer":"Rome , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Vatican did not know about an American priest believed to have molested up to 200 boys until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and then dropped the case , its top spokesman said Thursday . Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi issued the statement in response to a New York Times story alleging that top Vatican officials , including the future Pope Benedict XVI , failed to discipline or defrock the now-deceased Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy of Wisconsin , despite warnings from several American bishops . But Jeff Anderson , a lawyer who obtained the internal church paperwork the newspaper based its story on , said it `` shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope . '' Lombardi rejected the accusation . `` During the mid-1970s , some of Father Murphy 's victims reported his abuse to civil authorities , who investigated him at that time , '' Lombardi said . `` However , according to news reports , that investigation was dropped . '' The Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , who would later become pope , `` was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later , '' Lombardi said . The office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked . `` The case of Lawrence Murphy has been well-documented since the mid-1970s , when allegations were first reported to civil authorities , although criminal charges were not filed , '' the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said in a statement Thursday . `` Murphy 's actions were criminal , and we sincerely apologize to those who have been harmed . The Archdiocese of Milwaukee continues to reach out to victims-survivors who were harmed by Lawrence Murphy and encourages them to report any abuse they suffered . '' Anderson , a lawyer representing five men who are suing the archdiocese , obtained correspondence from Milwaukee to Ratzinger as part of the lawsuit , along with other internal church documents related to the case . The documents , dating to 1974 , include letters between bishops and the Vatican , victims ' affidavits , the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Murphy and minutes of a final Vatican meeting on the case . Murphy began as a teacher for St. John 's School for the Deaf in St. Francis , Wisconsin , in 1950 , and was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation , according to the documents , which CNN has seen . Many of Murphy 's victims were hearing-impaired . Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from Milwaukee 's then-archbishop , Rembert G. Weakland . After eight months , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who at the time was second in command of the doctrinal office and now is the Vatican 's secretary of state , told Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial , the documents show . Lombardi said that church rules did not mean a priest would automatically be punished but that punishment , if warranted , could include being defrocked . `` In such cases , the Code of Canon Law does not envision automatic penalties but recommends that a judgment be made not excluding even the greatest ecclesiastical penalty of dismissal from the clerical state , '' he said . `` In light of the facts that Father Murphy was elderly and in very poor health , and that he was living in seclusion and no allegations of abuse had been reported in over 20 years , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith suggested that the Archbishop of Milwaukee give consideration to addressing the situation by , for example , restricting Father Murphy 's public ministry and requiring that Father Murphy accept full responsibility for the gravity of his acts , '' the statement said , noting that Murphy died four months later . Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told of the abuse , but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities , according to Anderson , the lawyer . Lombardi , however , said that neither canon law nor Vatican norms prohibit the reporting of such cases to law enforcement . But `` he did not address why that had never happened in this case , '' the Times said . The Archdiocese of Milwaukee said abuse was reported in fall 1973 to Milwaukee police , who turned the report over to St. Francis police , but no charges were filed . Murphy was removed in May 1974 as director of the St. John 's School for the Deaf but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974 , when he was removed from any role at the school , according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese Web site . In August 1974 , a series of newspaper articles in the Milwaukee Sentinel reported on Murphy 's removal and the allegations , the chronology said . In September , he relocated to a family home in the Diocese of Superior . A district attorney reviewed the allegations against Murphy in fall 1974 , according to the archdiocese . A civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to Murphy but was resolved the following year , the chronology said . Murphy 's request for retirement was accepted in January 1993 , but restrictions against him were reinstated that year and reinforced twice . The bishops warned the Vatican , according to the newspaper , that failure to act on the matter could result in embarrassment to the Church . `` The tragic case of Father Lawrence Murphy , a priest of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee , involved particularly vulnerable victims who suffered terribly , '' Lombardi said in the statement . `` By sexually abusing children who were hearing-impaired , Father Murphy violated the law and , more importantly , the sacred trust that his victims had placed in him . `` In the late 1990s , after over two decades had passed since the abuse had been reported to diocesan officials and the police , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was presented for the first time with the question of how to treat the Murphy case canonically , '' the statement said . At the time , there was no procedure in place for reporting church abuse to the doctrinal office , according to Vatican sources . The office was informed of the matter , Lombardi said , because it involved abuse at confession , which is a violation of the Sacrament of Penance . St. John 's School for the Deaf closed in 1983 , the archdiocese said in its statement . `` Most importantly , today , no priest with any substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor serves in public ministry in any way in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama headed to the Czech Republic on Wednesday night to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and sign an arms control agreement that reduces the nuclear stockpiles of both nations . The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- to be signed Thursday by the two leaders builds on a previous agreement that expired in December . Obama has called the treaty the `` the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades '' and said it would cut the nuclear weapons of the United States and Russia by about a third . After meeting with Medvedev and attending the signing ceremony in Prague , the Czech Republic capital , Obama will have dinner with heads of government from 11 countries -- Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia . The highlight of the two-day trip is the new treaty with Russia , which is another step in nuclear arms relations between the former Cold War adversaries . Its signing comes two days after the Obama administration announced a new U.S. nuclear weapons policy and four days before Obama convenes a summit of 47 nations on nuclear security issues . `` It significantly reduces missiles and launchers , '' Obama said of the new treaty , which lasts for 10 years . `` It puts in place a strong and effective verification regime . And it maintains the flexibility that we need to protect and advance our national security , and to guarantee our unwavering commitment to the security of our allies . '' Obama has made nuclear non-proliferation a major priority of his presidency , prompting criticism from conservatives who fear the president will weaken the U.S. nuclear deterrent against possible attack . `` We believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism , Iran and North Korea , '' according to a statement issued Tuesday by Arizona 's two Republican U.S. senators , John McCain and Jon Kyl . `` The Obama Administration 's policies , thus far , have failed to do that and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would be proliferators and supporters of terrorism . '' According to information released by the White House , the new treaty limits both nations to `` significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years '' of its signing . One of the limits : 1,550 warheads . `` Warheads on deployed ICBMs -LRB- Intercontinental ballistic missiles -RRB- and deployed SLBMs -LRB- submarine-launched ballistic missiles -RRB- count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit , '' the White House said . There also are limits on launchers . The treaty also lays out a `` verification regime '' that includes on-site inspections , data exchanges and notifications , the White House said . `` The treaty does not contain any constraints on testing , development or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned United States long-range conventional strike capabilities , '' according to the White House . Obama said the agreement is part of the U.S. effort to `` reset '' the U.S. relationship with Russia . `` With this agreement , the United States and Russia -- the two largest nuclear powers in the world -- also send a clear signal that we intend to lead , '' the president said . `` By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons , and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities . '' Negotiators have been working since April 2009 to wrap up the `` follow-on '' to the 1991 START agreement . Talks were difficult , with disagreements over verification , including on-site inspection of missiles that carry nuclear warheads . A U.S. official with knowledge of the talks earlier said that negotiators had found `` innovative '' ways to verify what each side has . Verification will be a top issue politically because the U.S. Senate and the Russian parliament will each have to ratify any agreement . Russian officials at one point objected to the Obama administration 's plans to build a missile-defense system in Eastern Europe . Specifically , they were angered by news leaks from Romania that it had agreed to allow missile interceptors to be installed in that country . The issue , according to arms control experts , was resolved by including non-binding language in the START treaty 's preamble stating that there is a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons ; however , the treaty itself deals only with limits on offensive weapons systems . This resolution could help placate U.S. critics who want no link in the treaty between offensive and defensive weapons , arguing that it might be used to try to limit a U.S. missile-defense plan . The new treaty would be the first pact related to arms control since the end of the Cold War , experts have said , setting the stage for further arms reductions that will tackle thorny issues such as what to do with non-deployed warheads that are kept in storage , tactical nuclear weapons and further cuts in missiles and launch vehicles . Some of those issues are expected to come up at the nuclear security summit in Washington on April 12-13 .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Top Democrats have expressed concern over President Obama 's plan to draw down nearly two-thirds of U.S. forces in Iraq by August 2010 , while some key Republicans are offering praise . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this week questioned the need to keep 50,000 troops in Iraq until 2011 . At issue : Obama plans to leave between 35,000 to 50,000 residual forces in the war-torn country , serving in a training or advisory role to the Iraqi military . All U.S. troops have to be out of Iraq by December 31 , 2011 , under an agreement the Bush administration signed with the Iraqi government last year . There are currently 142,000 U.S. troops in Iraq . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , indicated earlier this week that the residual force Obama is planning to leave in Iraq is too large . Pelosi on Wednesday told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow : `` I do n't know what the justification is for 50,000 , a presence of 50,000 troops in Iraq . ... I do think that there 's a need for some . I do n't know that all of them have to be in -LSB- the -RSB- country . '' Pelosi clarified her concerns after Obama announced the plan at an event Friday at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . iReport.com : Do you think troops should be pulled , or should numbers increase ? `` As President Obama 's Iraq policy is implemented , the remaining missions given to our remaining forces must be clearly defined and narrowly focused so that the number of troops needed to perform them is as small as possible , '' Pelosi said in a press release . `` The president 's decision means that the time has come at last for Iraq 's own security forces to have the prime responsibility for Iraq 's security . '' Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D-California , co-founder of the Out of Iraq House Caucus , was critical of the plan . `` I am deeply troubled by the suggestion that a force of 50,000 troops could remain in Iraq beyond this time frame , '' she said in a statement Friday . `` Call such a troop level what you will , but such a large number can only be viewed by the Iraqi public as an enduring occupation force . This is unacceptable . '' Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , said that while he supports Obama 's `` step in the right direction , '' the new troop plan does not `` go far enough . '' `` You can not leave combat troops in a foreign country to conduct combat operations and call it the end of the war . You ca n't be in and out at the same time , '' Kucinich said in a release Friday . And top Senate Democrats echoed some of their House colleagues ' skepticism . `` That 's a little higher number than I expected , '' Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , said Thursday . The third-ranking Senate Democrat , Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , said , `` It has to be done responsibly , we all agree . But 50,000 is more than I would have thought . '' On Thursday afternoon , the president briefed bipartisan leaders from the House of Representatives and Senate -- including Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , at the White House about the troop plan . Sen. Carl Levin , D-Michigan , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that 50,000 is `` somewhat larger '' than what he expected . However , he said he has always believed `` a few tens of thousands '' of troops would be needed for noncombat missions such as training and fighting terrorism . Watch Obama announce the new Iraq plan '' Before the White House meeting , Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Senate Democrat and a close Obama ally , said he was anxious to get the troops home . But he defended the administration , saying it is `` trying to strike the right balance '' between ending the war and maintaining stability in Iraq . Rep. John McHugh of New York , the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , said later that Obama assured him the plan to withdraw all combat forces will be revisited if conditions on the ground in Iraq deteriorate . `` The president 's objective to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq is one we should pray for , plan for and work toward , '' McHugh said in a statement . `` However , I remain concerned that the security situation in Iraq is fragile , and we should work to mitigate any risks to our troops and their mission . I specifically raised these points with the president this evening . '' McHugh added , `` Our commanders must have the flexibility they need in order to respond to these challenges , and President Obama assured me that there is a ` Plan B. ' '' On Friday morning , McCain , who criticized Obama 's plan to pull combat troops from Iraq in the presidential race , offered warm praise for the new proposal . In a speech on the Senate floor , McCain said Obama 's decision is `` reasonable '' and that he is `` cautiously optimistic that the plan that is laid out by the president can lead to success . '' McCain , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that a `` failing situation in Iraq has been arrested and reversed '' due to the `` dramatic success of the surge strategy , '' referring to President Bush 's plan in 2007 to send additional troops to Iraq . He also praised Obama 's willingness to leave behind a significant residual force and reassess the situation if conditions change in the future . `` We are finally on a path to success '' in Iraq , McCain said . `` Let us have no crisis of confidence now . '' Obama touted his opposition to the Iraq war during the presidential campaign , a position popular with liberal groups such as MoveOn.org . But according to a new CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll , many Democrats may not be satisfied with Obama 's plan . When asked if the U.S. should keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are currently stationed there , 12 percent of Democratic respondents agreed -- compared with 58 percent of Republican respondents . Watch more on the poll '' Asked if U.S. forces should be removed by `` next spring , '' 87 percent of Democrats and 39 percent of Republicans surveyed were in favor . But the survey suggested that half of all Americans think the United States is winning the war in Iraq , the highest percentage since that question was first asked in a CNN poll in 2004 . `` This indicates that the public thinks the surge worked , but that has n't changed their view of the war in Iraq at all , '' said Keating Holland , CNN polling director . `` As a result , nearly seven out of 10 favor the idea of removing most U.S. troops from Iraq by next spring , a proposal that was a key part of Obama 's presidential campaign last year . '' The CNN\/Opinion Research poll was conducted February 18-19 , with 1,046 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The new district attorney of Boulder County , Colorado , said he plans to take a fresh look at the investigation into the 1996 slaying of JonBenet Ramsey . The DA 's office assumed responsibility for the investigation in 2002 . But District Attorney Stan Garnett told CNN that he wants to decide during his first 30 days in office whether the case should be returned to Boulder police . `` I 'm trying to determine whether it 's efficient to have the ongoing investigation handled by my office or somebody else , '' said Garnett , who was sworn in as district attorney January 13 . The DA 's office is relatively small , he said , with 27 lawyers and six investigators handling between 2,000 and 2,500 felony cases a year . Although the Ramsey case has not generated news since last year , tips and information regularly come in to authorities . Whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing , Garnett said . He said reports that he is considering reopening the case are inaccurate . `` It 's not closed . It has n't been solved , and it 's been open the whole time . '' The case is one of the nation 's most famous unsolved murders . On December 26 , 1996 , John Ramsey discovered the body of his 6-year-old daughter , JonBenet , in the basement of the family 's Boulder home . The girl had been strangled and beaten . A ransom note was found on the stairs of the home , demanding $ 118,000 . Early in the case , Boulder police said JonBenet 's parents , John and Patsy Ramsey , were under `` an umbrella of suspicion '' in her death . But they were never formally named as suspects , and a grand jury refused to indict them . Patsy Ramsey died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer . In July , Garnett 's predecessor , Mary Lacy , issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the Ramsey family after a DNA test performed using new technology showed that DNA found on JonBenet 's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man . The test results , Lacy said , were `` powerful evidence '' that allows investigators to think the Ramsey family were victims , not suspects . That same third-party DNA exonerated John Mark Karr , a one-time teacher , after he was arrested in Thailand and brought to Colorado . Authorities said Karr told a University of Colorado professor in e-mails that he was involved in JonBenet 's death . He told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died , although he called her death an accident and said he loved her . Lacy was widely criticized , including by then-Gov . Bill Owens , for the handling of Karr 's arrest . Boulder police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation . But , Garnett said Friday , `` I 've been very impressed by the Boulder P.D. . They are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well . ... They 've done a very nice job . '' The department has 24 investigators , four times as many as the DA 's staff , he said . Garnett was elected DA in November to replace Lacy , who could not run again because of term limits . Before he was elected , he served as a trial lawyer for 22 years , according to the DA 's Web site .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly all healthy pregnant women who receive a single dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine will be protected from that flu , according to just-released clinical trial data . In a news conference Monday at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies , over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine . And at this point , there have been no reported side effects , Fauci said . Fauci stressed that these results should be reassuring for already-vaccinated pregnant women and this is `` vital information for those who have not yet been vaccinated . '' He added that `` pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well , and no safety concerns have arisen . '' Pregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain . Since H1N1 , also known as swine flu , first emerged in April , 28 pregnant women reportedly have died from complications of this flu , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- . Despite health officials repeatedly saying the H1N1 vaccine is safe , questions about it persist . To reassure those who question the safety of the vaccine , Dr. Bruce Gellin , director of the National Vaccine Program Office , noted that a new independent panel has been formed to review data from all sources on the safety of the vaccine . The group will monitor all sources reporting problems with the vaccine . `` The vast amount of adverse events have been minor , '' said Gellin . He said there has been one reported death linked to the vaccine , but further investigation showed that the person died from the actual H1N1 flu , not the vaccine . Gellin said the panel was designed to keep an eye on any possible negative consequences and report them immediately . According to Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC , who also attended the news conference , 30 million doses of the vaccine are available for states to order . She explained that that does not mean 30 million shots are available to the public at this point . The vaccines need to be ordered by each state and distributed before they make it to doctor 's offices and clinics . Schuchat reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks , as demand for shots continues to rise . Fauci also noted further studies on children -- youngsters between the ages of 6 months to 35 months , and children from the age of 3 years to 9 years -- found they responded much better to two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine , than one single dose . For children 9 and older , a single 15-microgram dose gave young people a robust immune reaction that should protect them against the virus . When asked how this H1N1 virus differed from the seasonal flu , Schuchat said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to high-risk patients . `` With seasonal flu , '' said Schuchat , `` Ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65 . '' She noted , `` But with H1N1 , 90 percent of the deaths , thus far , have been in people under the age of 65 . '' And she added , `` half of those are under the age of 25 years , in young people . So those are the people we want to get our message to . Children , pregnant women , young people should be getting vaccinated . '' Fauci agreed saying , `` You need to look at the risk ... Right now , the risk of becoming seriously ill , even dying from this virus , outweighs the risk of something happening to you if you take the vaccine . It 's really that simple .

{"answer":"UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coca cultivation and cocaine production have decreased in Colombia but increased in Bolivia and Peru , the United Nations reported . Workers help eradicate coca plantations in northwest Colombia in May . Colombian cultivation was down 18 percent , and production decreased 28 percent in 2008 , the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime said in a report issued Friday . But cultivation increased 6 percent in Bolivia and 4.5 percent in Peru , the report said . Likewise , production went up 9 percent in Bolivia and 4.1 percent in Peru . `` The increases for Bolivia and Peru show a trend in the wrong direction , '' said Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the U.N. drug office . Much of the decline in Colombia resulted from the manual eradication of 237 acres of coca , an increase of 44 percent over 2007 , and the spraying of another 328 acres with herbicide , the U.N. said . The production level is at a 10-year-low , the report said , and the cultivation amount is down to 2004 to 2006 levels . `` This is a remarkable achievement , '' Costa said in a release . `` It means that more coca bush was eradicated in Colombia than was grown in all of Bolivia and Peru . '' The value of coca leaf in Colombia is decreasing , making it less attractive for farmers -- 20,000 fewer households grew coca in 2008 than in 2007 , a decrease of 26 percent . The drug trade also is being disrupted , the report said . In Colombia , the U.N. said , authorities seized 200 tons of cocaine in 2008 , a 57 percent increase in seizures over 2007 , the report said . Peru reported an 86 percent increase in seizures of coca base and a 100 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine . Bolivia , likewise , reported a 45 percent uptick in seizures of coca base and a 145 percent increase in the seizure of cocaine . `` Cocaine supply is shrinking , as is demand in major markets of North America while cocaine use in Western Europe has stopped growing , '' Costa said . `` This may explain why prices are up , and purity is down . This may also explain why cartels are becoming so violent . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three Pakistan international cricketers have been banned from the sport for the next five years after being found guilty at an anti-corruption hearing on Saturday . Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found to have been involved in `` spot-fixing '' -- a practice involving illegal gambling during matches . Butt , 26 , was banned for 10 years with half of that suspended on certain conditions while Asif , 28 , received a seven-year ban with 24 months suspended . Amir , 18 , was given a straight five-year penalty for his involvement in incidents during the Test series against England in August 2010 . They have 21 days to appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport . The International Cricket Council announced the punishments following an independent tribunal 's hearing in Qatar . It came a day after Britain 's Crown Prosecution Service charged the trio and their agent Mazhar Majeed with conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments , and conspiracy to cheat . Amir and Asif were accused of deliberately bowling no-balls -- deliveries which incur a scoring penalty and can not dismiss batsmen -- to the instructions of Majeed , who received money from a third party , while Butt was said to be aware of the arrangement . The conditions of the reduced sentences require Butt and Asif to refrain from further breaches of the anti-corruption code and to participate in an education program run by the Pakistan Cricket Board . Pakistan trio to face criminal charges The independent tribunal resumed its hearing on Saturday after adjourning on January 11 . It dismissed a charge that Butt had agreed to bat out a run-less -LRB- or `` maiden '' -RRB- over in the match played at London 's Oval ground from August 18-21 , but said the player failed to disclose to the ICC 's anti-corruption unit that Majeed had approached him with such a request . The main charges stem from the following match at Lord 's , the final Test of the series . `` The tribunal found that the charges under Article 2.1.1 of the Code that -LRB- respectively -RRB- Mr Asif agreed to bowl , and did bowl , a deliberate no-ball in the Lord 's Test match played between Pakistan and England from 26 to 29 August 2010 , Mr Amir agreed to bowl , and did bowl , two deliberate no-balls in the same Test , and Mr Butt was party to the bowling of those deliberate no-balls , were proved , '' it said in a statement on the ICC website on Saturday . Amir is the youngest bowler to claim 50 Test wickets , six of which came at Lord 's as Pakistan lost to England by an innings and 225 runs . Butt has played in 33 Test matches since making his debut for Pakistan in 2003 , and scored 1,889 runs . He became captain of the side in 2010 and led his country in a Test series against Australia as well as the tour of England before being replaced by Misbah-ul-Haq in the wake of the scandal . Asif has twice tested positive for steroids , resulting in year-long bans , and in 2008 was detained for three weeks after being found in possession of illegal substances at Dubai airport .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama tapped a former Army general Monday to lead the Transportation Security Administration . Obama nominated Robert A. Harding , a retired major general with 33 years in the Army , to become the TSA administrator . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the nomination with Harding by her side . `` The TSA administrator is among the most important , unfilled posts in the Obama administration , '' Napolitano said . `` The president and I both believe that Gen. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of this agency . '' `` If there were ever a nominee that warranted expedited , and detailed , consideration in the Senate , this is it , '' she said . Obama announced the nomination in a White House news release . `` I am confident that Bob 's talent and expertise will make him a tremendous asset in our ongoing efforts to bolster security and screening measures at our airports , '' Obama said . `` I can think of no one more qualified than Bob to take on this important job , and I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead . '' The TSA has been under the leadership of an acting administrator since Edmund `` Kip '' Hawley resigned at the end of the Bush administration . In September , Obama nominated Erroll Southers , a Los Angeles airport police department official , to the head the agency . But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint , R-South Carolina , spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners . Southers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago . Harding would be the TSA 's first African-American administrator . Southers is also black . Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates , a defense and intelligence government contracting firm he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009 . From 1996 to 2000 , Harding was director for operations at the Defense Intelligence Agency , where he was the Defense Department 's senior human intelligence officer . Before that , he was director for intelligence for the Army 's Southern Command .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Pennsylvania woman told police she was attacked at an ATM in Pittsburgh by a robber who became angry when he saw a John McCain bumper sticker on her car , a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh Police Department said Thursday . Police can not confirm whether a man attacked this woman because she had a McCain sticker on her car . Public Information Officer Diane Richard said police can not substantiate her story , however , and the investigation is ongoing . Richard said the 20-year-old told investigators a man approached her Wednesday night at an ATM in the city 's East End , put a blade to her neck and demanded money . She said she gave him $ 60 and stepped away from him , Richard said . But the woman said the man `` became very angry '' when he noticed her car had a bumper sticker supporting the GOP presidential nominee , according to Richard . The woman said he punched her in the back of the head , knocked her to the ground and `` continued to punch and kick her while threatening her , '' the spokeswoman said . Before he left , the woman said , he carved the letter `` B '' into her face with a knife , according to Richard . There was no indication what the `` B '' indicated . The alleged assailant fled on foot , Richard said . `` We , the police , can not substantiate this yet , '' she said . `` This is what she told police . '' The woman , who is not from Pittsburgh , refused medical attention , Richard said , although she told the investigating officer she would see a doctor Thursday . There was no update on her condition , she said . Richard said the woman described her alleged attacker as a dark-skinned African-American , 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair , wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes . McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker told CNN that McCain and running mate Sarah Palin `` spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident earlier this afternoon . '' Hazelbaker said the campaign would not offer more detail out of respect for the woman 's privacy . The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama responded to the report with a statement saying , `` Our thoughts and prayers are with the young woman for her to make a speedy recovery , and we hope that the person who perpetrated this crime is swiftly apprehended and brought to justice .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elvis Presley may have left the building three decades ago , but he raked in more money last year than many living titans of the music industry Singer Elvis Presley tops the Forbes list for the second year in a row , raking in $ 52 million last year . For the second year in a row , Presley topped the Forbes magazine 's list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities , hauling in $ 52 million last year . In comparison , the very-much-alive Justin Timberlake earned $ 44 million while another superstar , Madonna , made $ 40 million , the magazine reported Tuesday . The 30th anniversary of Presley 's death boosted attendance and merchandise sales last year at his Memphis , Tennessee , home , Graceland . A long list of licensing deals , such as a Presley show on satellite radio , added to the earnings . The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities ' earnings since 2001 . Since 2003 , the feature has coincided with Halloween . This year , the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $ 194 million in the last 12 months . The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities ' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008 . Some celebrities are staples on the list , which is in its eighth year . Cartoonist Charles Schulz , who created Snoopy , Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of `` Peanuts '' characters , is second on the list . Schulz , who died in 2000 , had posthumous earnings last year of $ 33 million , the magazine reported . He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters , the magazine said . Schulz and Presley join Theodor '' Dr. Seuss '' Geisel -LRB- this year 's No. 6 -RRB- , Beatles legend John Lennon -LRB- No. 7 -RRB- and actress Marilyn Monroe -LRB- No. 9 -RRB- as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception . Physicist Albert Einstein , best known for his theory of relativity , is fourth on the list . It is his third consecutive year making the Forbes rankings . Though he died in 1955 , a franchise bearing his name -- Baby Einstein -- made big bucks last year selling educational books , DVDs , CDs , toys and other products . It plans to expand into the young-adult market this year . Australian actor Heath Ledger , who died of an overdose in January , made his debut on the list in third place . The magazine estimated his earnings at $ 20 million , thanks to the success of the movie , `` The Dark Knight , '' in which Ledger played the Joker . The movie grossed $ 991 million worldwide . Paul Newman , who died of lung cancer last month , also made his first appearance on the list , raking in $ 5 million . `` His income still largely stems from residuals from his classic pictures , as well as more recent productions , '' the magazine said . The legendary actor 's line of natural and organic food products , Newman 's Own , earned revenues of $ 120 million last year , but the earnings were not considered in the tally because Newman donated all profits to charity while he was living , the magazine said . Several entertainers from last year 's list failed to make this year 's cut , including composer , producer and Beatles guitarist George Harrison , rapper\/actor Tupac Shakur , `` Godfather of Soul '' James Brown , and reggae legend Bob Marley .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three people connected to the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , were killed in two drive-by shootings , a senior White House official told CNN Sunday . Two of the victims were an American employee at the consulate and her U.S. citizen husband . Their 1-year-old child , who was in a vehicle with the couple at the time of the shooting , survived the incident , according to the El Paso County Sheriff 's Office . The American couple were found dead inside a white Toyota RAV4 with Texas license plates , according to the Chihuahua state attorney general 's office . The woman was shot in the neck and left arm , while the man had a bullet wound near his right eye , officials said . `` We know that the U.S. citizens were targeted , '' Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN , saying a police officer witnessed a car shooting at the Americans ' car . `` We know they were chasing them . We know they wanted to kill them . '' The Americans were identified as Arthur Redelfs , 34 , and Lesley Enriquez by the El Paso County Sheriff 's Office , where Redelfs worked as a detention officer . Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the department , according to Jesse Tovar , a spokesman for the sheriff 's office . `` On behalf of the men and women of the Sheriff 's Office , I would like to extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the family during this difficult time , '' said Sheriff Richard Wiles . `` Our thoughts and prayers are with them . '' Authorities retrieved only one shell casing , from a 9 mm weapon . About 10 minutes before authorities received the call , they were alerted to a body inside a 2003 Honda Pilot . Inside was the husband of the Mexican employee , identified as Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros , 37 . Reyes said the victim was a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. consulate . Two children , 4 and 7 , were injured in that shooting and transported to the hospital , the attorney general 's office said . Police recovered two shells at that scene from an assault rifle , authorities said . `` The president is deeply saddened and outraged by the news of the brutal murders of three people associated with the United States Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez , '' National Security Council Spokesman Mike Hammer said in the statement Sunday . `` He extends his condolences to the families and condemns these attacks on consular and diplomatic personnel serving at our foreign missions . In concert with Mexican authorities , we will work tirelessly to bring their killers to justice . '' In response , the U.S. State Department authorized the temporary relocation of employees ' families working in border-area consulates . `` These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are , sadly , part of a growing tragedy besetting many communities in Mexico , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement Sunday night . `` They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the Government of -LRB- Mexican -RRB- President -LRB- Felipe -RRB- Calder\u00f3n to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico . '' The families of employees at U.S. consulates in Tijuana , Nogales , Ciudad Juarez , Nuevo Laredo , Monterrey and Matamoros , are allowed to leave for a period of 30 days `` in response to an increase in violence along the Mexican side of its border with the U.S. , '' State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN . After 30 days , the authorization can be renewed , depending on a review , Lash said , adding that this was not a mandatory evacuation . The announcement was part of a warning to American citizens regarding travel to Mexico . The warning urges U.S. citizens to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango , Coahuila and Chihuahua , where Juarez is located , because of recent violent attacks . U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of these three states . The attacks include the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua , the warning states . `` Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , '' the warning says . `` During some of these incidents , U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area . '' The mayor said the shootings highlight a problem shared by both countries along their border . `` It is not just a Mexican problem -- it 's is a U.S.-Mexico problem , '' Reyes said . `` I 'm very glad that the U.S. has taken that position . '' He said he supported the State Department 's authorization to consular families and that `` it is important they feel safe . '' Mexico on Sunday said that its government was committed to protecting all people , citizens and visitors alike , diplomats or not . `` The Mexican government deeply laments the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez , '' Mexico 's foreign ministry said in a statement . `` The Mexican authorities are working with determination to clear up the facts surrounding the crime scene and put those responsible before the law . '' Juarez is one of the front lines in Mexico 's war against the drug cartels that operate in its territory . More than 2,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2009 . Juarez , across from El Paso , Texas , has become a focal point of Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's anti-drug efforts after the January 31 killings of 15 people , most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime . The incident sparked outrage across Mexico . In the western state of Guerrero , at least 25 people were killed in a series of violent acts on Saturday , state officials said . The bodies of 14 people , including nine civilians and five police officers , were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco , the official Notimex news agency reported , citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas . In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso , 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to carry out search warrants on two locations , Salinas said . Police in the state were on a heightened security alert , he said . The government has not released official figures , but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009 .

Israeli border police charge towards Palestinian protesters during clashes in Jerusalem 's Old City . Street battles began in the Old City on Sunday morning , when Palestinians praying at the site -- known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif , or `` Noble Sanctuary , '' and to Jews as Temple Mount -- began to throw rocks at the visiting Jews , said Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld . Police responded with stun grenades and arrested eight demonstrators , he said . Rosenfeld also said two Palestinians and two police officers were wounded in the melee , but Sheikh Ikrima Sabri , a former grand mufti of Jerusalem , said nine Palestinians were hurt . Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat called the visit a deliberate provocation by hardliners opposed to a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , and criticized the police response to the protests . Erakat compared the visit to the 2000 trip by Ariel Sharon -- before he was elected prime minister -- to the al-Aqsa mosque that Palestinians blame for touching off three years of violence . `` We 've seen this before , and we know what the consequences are , '' Erakat said in a statement issued Sunday evening . He said the visit was `` deliberately timed '' on the eve of the anniversary of Sharon 's September 28 , 2000 visit . There was no immediate response from the Israeli government to Erakat 's statement . The demonstration was broken up about 1:30 p.m. , but Palestinians continued battling police with rocks and Molotov cocktails for several hours in other parts of east Jerusalem . Erakat said Israel was `` deliberately escalating tensions '' in Jerusalem at the same time that U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to coax the two sides into restarting talks aimed a permanent settlement of the decades-old conflict . `` Providing a police escort for settlers who are against peace at all costs , and whose presence is deliberately designed to provoke a reaction , are not the actions of someone who is committed to peace , but of someone who will go to extraordinary lengths to scuttle all hopes of peace , '' Erakat said .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A construction company and three supervisors were indicted Monday on manslaughter and related charges in the deaths of two firefighters battling a 2007 blaze at the Deutsche Bank building in lower Manhattan . Firefighters Joseph Graffagnino , left , and Robert Beddia died in the Deutsche Bank building blaze . Prosecutors also reached an agreement with the city of New York requiring the implementation of new fire safety measures . `` Our goal is to put in place procedures which will prevent a disaster of the magnitude of the Deutsche Bank fire and to make sure that firefighters are never again exposed to the risks they faced in that fire , '' Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said . The indictments against the John Galt Corp. , Jeffrey Melofchik , Mitchel Alvo and Salvatore DePaola also allege negligent homicide and reckless endangerment . The indictment is the result of an investigation into an August 18 , 2007 , blaze that consumed nine floors of the Deutsche Bank building . The building had been scheduled for demolition after being contaminated by debris , asbestos and other hazardous substances after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center buildings . The two firefighters killed in the blaze -- Robert Beddia , 53 , and Joseph Graffagnino , 33 -- were caught in a smoke-filled stairwell that prosecutors say was improperly blocked off by barriers erected to seal off floors being stripped of contaminants . In addition to the deaths of Beddia and Graffagnino , 105 other firefighters were injured combating the blaze . The agreement with the city of New York mandates the creation of a new civilian inspection unit at the city 's fire department , the sole purpose of which will be to perform inspections at construction sites throughout the city . `` The regulatory measures we have put in place and the additional reforms set out today are designed to prevent any firefighter again confronting the conditions that firefighters faced at the Deutsche Bank building that tragic day , '' New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement . The father of one of the firefighters killed in the blaze , Joseph Graffagnino Sr. , said the indictments did not go far enough . `` I do n't understand if the -LSB- city -RSB- agency ca n't be indicted , why ca n't individuals be indicted who we already know should have been responsible for doing their jobs and did not do their jobs , '' he said to reporters .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , has died at age 93 , according to his family . Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam . McNamara was a member of Kennedy 's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war . But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam , overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops . Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed `` McNamara 's War , '' he later said both administrations were `` terribly wrong '' to have pursued military action beyond 1963 . `` External military force can not reconstruct a failed state , and Vietnam , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the `` Cold War '' documentary series . `` We did n't recognize it as such . '' A native of San Francisco , McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master 's degree in business from Harvard . He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II , when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency . After the war , he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family . A month later , the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the `` whiz kids '' who joined the young president 's administration . In October 1962 , after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba , McNamara was one of Kennedy 's top advisers in the standoff that followed . The United States imposed a naval `` quarantine '' on Cuba , a Soviet ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion . The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba , a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people . In the 2003 documentary `` The Fog of War , '' McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to `` put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes . '' But he added , `` In the end , we lucked out . It was luck that prevented nuclear war . '' McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon , computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military 's vast purchasing and personnel system . And in Vietnam , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war . Metrics such as use of `` body counts '' and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict . McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand . He , Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia . But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union , which backed communist North Vietnam , McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon . `` The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , '' he told CNN . Casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war . In 1965 , a Quaker anti-war protester , Norman Morrison , set himself on fire outside McNamara 's office window . In 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon , which was ringed with troops . By November 1967 , McNamara told Johnson that there was `` no reasonable way '' to end the war quickly , and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon . By the end of that month , Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank . But by March 1968 , Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara . He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election . After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968 , McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank . He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir , `` In Retrospect . '' `` You do n't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear , '' he told Morris . `` A lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me . A lot of people think I 'm a son of a bitch . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Interrogation tactics such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture when there was no intent to cause severe pain , according to a Bush-era memo on the tactics released Thursday . Attorney General Eric Holder says government workers who followed protocol wo n't be prosecuted . `` To violate the statute , an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering , '' said an August 2002 memo from then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee to John Rizzo , who was acting general counsel for the CIA . `` Because specific intent is an element of the offense , the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture . ... We have further found that if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering , he has not acted with specific intent , '' Bybee wrote . The Bybee opinion was sought on 10 interrogation tactics in the case of suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah . The memo authorized keeping Zubaydah in a dark , confined space small enough to restrict the individual 's movement for no more than two hours at a time . In addition , putting a harmless insect into the box with Zubaydah , who `` appears to have a fear of insects , '' and telling him it is a stinging insect would be allowed , as long as Zubaydah was informed the insect 's sting would not be fatal or cause severe pain . `` If , however , you were to place the insect in the box without informing him that you are doing so ... you should not affirmatively lead him to believe that any insect is present which has a sting that could produce severe pain or suffering or even cause his death , '' the memo said . Other memos allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper , and putting detainees on a liquid diet . On waterboarding , in which a person gets the sensation of drowning , the memo said , `` although the waterboard constitutes a threat of imminent death , prolonged mental harm must nonetheless result '' to violate the law . Authorities also were allowed to slap a detainee 's face `` to induce shock , surprise or humiliation '' and strike his abdomen with the back of the hand in order to disabuse a detainee 's notion that he will not be touched , the memos said . Bybee noted in the memo that the CIA agreed all tactics should be used under expert supervision . Other memos said waterboarding can be used only if the CIA has `` credible intelligence that a terrorist attack is imminent '' and if a detainee is believed to have information that could prevent , disrupt or delay an attack , and other methods fail to elicit the information . Another memo to Rizzo , from Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury on May 10 , 2005 , noted that nudity could be used as an interrogation technique . `` Detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper , '' it said , noting that the diaper is `` for sanitary and health purposes of the detainee ; it is not used for the purpose of humiliating the detainee and it is not considered to be an interrogation technique . '' `` The detainee 's skin condition is monitored , and diapers are changed as needed so that the detainee does not remain in a soiled diaper , '' the memo said . Another Bradbury memo laid out techniques and when they should be used in a `` prototypical interrogation . '' `` Several of the techniques used by the CIA may involve a degree of physical pain , as we have previously noted , including facial and abdominal slaps , walling , stress positions and water dousing , '' it said . `` Nevertheless , none of these techniques would cause anything approaching severe physical pain . '' All of the CIA techniques were adapted from military `` survival evasion resistance escape '' training , according to a May 30 , 2005 , memo from Bradbury to Rizzo . `` Although there are obvious differences between training exercises and actual interrogations , the fact that the United States uses similar techniques on its own troops for training purposes strongly suggests that these techniques are not categorically beyond the pale , '' the memo said . The memo said waterboarding and other techniques were used on Zubaydah ; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and identified as `` KSM '' in the memo ; and another suspected al Qaeda leader , Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri . `` The CIA believes that it would have been unable to obtain critical information from numerous detainees , including KSM and Abu Zubaydah , without these enhanced techniques , '' the memo said . `` These legal legal memoranda demonstrate in alarming detail exactly what the Bush administration authorized for ` high value detainees ' in U.S. custody , '' said Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , in a statement . `` The techniques are chilling . This was not an ` abstract legal theory , ' as some former Bush administration officials have characterized it . These were specific techniques authorized to be used on real people . '' In releasing the memos in response to a public records request from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups , the Obama administration informed CIA officials they will not be prosecuted for past waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics . Attorney General Eric Holder promised in a separate statement that officials who used the controversial interrogation tactics were in the clear if their actions were consistent with the legal advice from the Justice Department under which they were operating at the time . `` My judgment on the content of these memos is a matter of record , '' President Obama said in a statement released from the White House . Obama prohibited the use of `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in January . Such techniques `` undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer , '' he said Thursday . The president said that while United States must sometimes `` protect information that is classified for purposes of national security , '' he decided to release the memos because he believes `` strongly in transparency and accountability '' and `` exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release . '' Obama argued that `` withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time . '' `` This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past , and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States , '' he said . He added that the officials involved in the questionable interrogations would not be subject to prosecution because the intelligence community must be provided `` with the confidence '' it needs to do its job . The president pledged to work to ensure the actions described in the memos `` never take place again . '' CNN 's Kate Bolduan and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Barack Obama decisively defeated Sen. Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday , but Clinton 's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries . Sen. Barack Obama and his wife , Michelle , greet supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina . As polls closed in Indiana , Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama , but by the end of the evening , Clinton 's lead had shrunk , dragging the race out until early Wednesday . A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County , a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama . By Wednesday morning , all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points . There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana . Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally , Obama added four delegates to his lead , according to CNN estimates . Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina . With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton . Watch analysis of NC , IN primaries '' `` Some were saying that North Carolina would be a game-changer in this election . But today , what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington , '' Obama told supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina . Watch Obama thank his supporters '' Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina , according to exit polls , while Clinton claimed only 6 percent . Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama , according to the polls . Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis , `` it 's full-speed on to the White House . '' Watch Clinton greet her supporters '' Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana . She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday 's primary . In CNN exit polling , Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas , compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois . She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama 's 32 percent . In all , 1,738 voters were polled . Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline . `` I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners , '' she said at a rally in Indianapolis . `` For too long we 've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected , but I do n't think that 's what Americans need . `` Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party ; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together . '' Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession . Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama 's 47 percent . The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia , Kentucky and Oregon . According to early exit polls , half of Clinton 's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee . Watch what the exit polls show '' A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama , while 17 percent said they would not vote at all . Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November . Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina , where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain . Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote . Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November . In Indiana , 59 percent of Obama backers said they 'd vote for Clinton , and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain . Obama on Tuesday said he did n't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite . `` Tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her , '' he said . `` I 'm here tonight to tell you that I do n't believe it . Yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides . Yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win . But ultimately , this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain . `` This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future . '' Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won , and he is ahead in the popular vote , if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation . Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules . With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3 , the end of the primary season , the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates : Democratic governors , members of Congress and party officials . Watch how superdelegates could come into play '' Both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between Indiana and North Carolina , each arguing to crucial working-class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man suspected in the slayings of his girlfriend and her four children admitted choking the Oklahoma woman to death , but said the children were not present at the time , according to an affidavit filed in the case . Joshua Steven Durcho was arrested Tuesday after a car chase with police . Joshua Steven Durcho , 25 , was arrested Tuesday night in Hamilton County , Texas , officials said . He is suspected of killing Summer Rust , 25 ; her son Teagin , 4 ; and daughters Evynn , 3 , and Autumn and Kirsten , both 7 . All five bodies were found in Rust 's apartment in El Reno , Oklahoma , about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City , on Monday . Durcho 's first cousin notified authorities he found the body of Rust , who is identified in the affidavit as Summer Dawn Garas . Police also found the children 's bodies in the apartment , according to the affidavit , written by a special agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and filed Tuesday in Canadian County , Oklahoma , District Court . `` The Medical Examiner 's Office has reported to our agents that the preliminary assessment of the cause and manner of death for all five individuals was asphyxiation , suffocation and strangulation , '' the affidavit said . `` It was also reported that each body had ligature marks around the neck . The ligature marks were also observed by OSBI crime scene investigators . '' A spokeswoman for the state medical examiner 's office told CNN on Wednesday that the cause of death for Summer Rust and Teagin was strangulation , and that a ligature -- which could include a string , cord or wire -- was used to strangle them . Autopsies on the three girls were being conducted Wednesday , the spokeswoman said . A woman told police Durcho came to her apartment Monday afternoon and told her he had `` choked '' Summer Rust to death and that he was leaving Oklahoma , according to the affidavit . The woman asked Durcho about Rust 's children , the affidavit said , and `` Durcho told her that the children were at their grandmother 's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems . '' The woman called Durcho 's mother and told her what he had said about killing Rust , the affidavit said . Durcho 's mother drove to the apartment to check on the woman , but no one answered her knocks . She then called her nephew , Durcho 's cousin , to accompany her , leading to the discovery of Rust 's body , according to the document . About 6:30 p.m. Monday , the affidavit said , Durcho went to the home of another cousin , a female , and told her `` he was in trouble and that he was headed out of state . '' Durcho was driving Rust 's 1989 white Ford Thunderbird , the document said , and asked his cousin to swap cars with him , but she declined . A surveillance video showed Durcho at a truck stop on Interstate 40 about three hours later , driving the Thunderbird , the affidavit said . Early Tuesday morning , a text message was sent from a cell phone in Durcho 's possession to his mother 's cell phone , according to the affidavit . Tracking and cell phone records showed Durcho 's phone was located in Wichita Falls , Texas , at the time . Later that morning , Durcho called his mother , with the call shown to be from the Abilene , Texas , area , the affidavit said . Durcho 's mother said `` Durcho told her he loved her and had to go , '' according to the document . Police said Durcho was arrested after a car chase Tuesday night . A Texas state trooper attempted to stop the car Durcho was driving because the trooper suspected the driver was drunk , according to Erin Mangrum of the Canadian County sheriff 's office . When the trooper ran the license plate on the car , it matched the tag number of a vehicle sought by Oklahoma police . The car sped off , Mangrum said , and during the ensuing chase the car crashed . Durcho suffered only minor injuries and was taken into custody , Mangrum said . A court hearing was to be held for Durcho on Wednesday in Hamilton County , according to CNN affiliates . The Hamilton County district attorney 's office did not immediately return a call from CNN . Durcho was being held in the county jail Tuesday night , Mangrum said . Rust 's mother , Susan Rust of Carson City , Nevada , said Durcho was unemployed and had been living with Rust and her children .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Mexican woman -- a former inmate in Maricopa County , Arizona -- claims in a lawsuit that sheriff 's officers mistreated her during and after her pregnancy , including shackling her while she was in labor and after her Caesarean section . The federal suit filed by Miriam Mendiola-Martinez this week comes days after the U.S. Department of Justice alleged the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office , under the leadership of Sheriff Joe Arpaio , engaged in a pattern of discrimination against Latinos . Mendiola-Martinez 's suit is against the sheriff 's office , Arpaio , the Maricopa Medical Center and unidentified male and female officers , doctors and nurses . Mendiola-Martinez , a Mexican citizen , alleges in the suit she was arrested October 23 , 2009 , by Scottsdale , Arizona , police , and was booked into Maricopa County 's Estrella Jail on charges of identity theft . She was held without bond under Arizona law . According to the police report filed at the time of her arrest , Mendiola-Martinez was accused of using someone else 's name , date of birth and Social Security number to obtain work . She was arrested at her place of employment , a department store , while she was vacuuming the floor . When arrested , she was six months ' pregnant and had developed gestational diabetes and high blood pressure , according to the suit . On December 10 , 2009 , Mendiola-Martinez pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit forgery under a plea agreement . Her sentencing was set for December 24 . While incarcerated , in what her attorney , Joy Bertrand , called `` two months of hell , '' Mendiola-Martinez says in the suit that she was told by jail staff she would receive a `` special '' pregnancy diet . That diet , she claims , consisted of `` items such as two slices -LRB- of -RRB- cheese or ham , two slices of bread , indistinguishable cooked vegetables and occasionally a piece of fruit . '' She also said she was given two small cartons of milk a day and a pill that she was told was a vitamin . On days when she was transported to court , Mendiola-Martinez said , she was given no food during the day . In one instance , she alleges in the suit , an officer taunted her and other inmates with his food , telling them there was no food for them . On December 20 , four days before her sentencing , Mendiola-Martinez began to have contractions , according to the suit . She was shackled at her ankles and taken to the Maricopa Medical Center , where medical personnel determined she was not in labor and returned her to the jail . By the following day , however , her pain had increased . `` Ms. Mendiola-Martinez had been left in the jail visitation room , in extreme pain , '' the suit says . Guards ignored her attempts to speak to them in Spanish , so she asked an English-speaking person in the room to tell them she needed help . She was again taken to the Maricopa Medical Center , where she gave birth to a son via Caesarean section . She was shackled before and after the surgery , according to the suit . While she was recovering , a male correctional officer `` insisted that she be shackled to the hospital bed , '' and the shackles on her feet were painful , according to the lawsuit . Asked about the allegations in 2010 , Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office Lt. Brian Lee said in a statement that Mendiola-Martinez `` was not shackled during or directly after her medical procedure . After the procedure , she did have a soft restraint attached on one leg to her bed to prevent escape . '' Maricopa County sheriff 's spokesman Justin Griffin referred to the earlier statement when asked about the suit . Lee said Mendiola-Martinez was treated the way any other inmate would be while receiving treatment `` in an unsecured facility . Although she was being held on a Class Three felony , MCSO would have treated other inmates in the same manner . '' Mendiola-Martinez was not initially shackled , thanks to a `` guardian angel '' guard , Bertrand said , but `` she has her C-section , the guards change and this new guard comes in as she 's recovering from this major surgery and insists on shackling her to the bed . '' `` It 's incredibly painful , it 's incredibly dangerous because now she ca n't move around , she ca n't avoid clotting , and he refuses to take the shackle off , '' Bertrand said . Mendiola-Martinez was not allowed to hold or nurse her baby , the suit alleges . She was discharged on December 23 , but was not given a wheelchair to leave the hospital , the suit says . `` Wearing only a hospital gown , Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was forced to walk through the hospital with her hands and feet shackled , '' according to the suit . Meanwhile , she began to bleed , the suit says . A nurse `` scolded '' the corrections officer for taking her `` so quickly and without Ms. Mendiola receiving her pain medication or discharge paperwork , '' so she was again chained and forced to walk back to the nurse 's station , according to the suit . `` Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was in so much pain she could hardly walk , '' the suit says . `` Shackled at her hands and ankles , with a bleeding surgery wound , Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was returned to the Estrella jail . '' She spent the nights following her discharge `` in pain and crying , '' the suit says . Maricopa County Medical Center spokesman Michael Murphy , asked about shackling inmates in labor , said hospital staff defers to law enforcement , according to the suit . Hospital spokeswoman Judy Cane declined comment on the matter Wednesday . `` I 'd like to think that any woman held in that jail is going to be treated with respect and dignity , '' Bertrand said . Mendiola-Martinez declined to be interviewed , saying she fears retaliation by the sheriff 's office . International standards say using restraints on pregnant women `` is cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment , and given medical or other factors impeding pregnant or birthing women from attempting escape or becoming violent , the presumption must be that no restraints should be applied , '' the suit says . `` A woman 's privacy and dignity must be respected during labor and birth . '' International standards also say a pregnant woman in her third trimester should not be restrained while being transported , and efforts should be made `` to afford the mother reasonable access to the baby without impeding her movements by restraints , '' according to the suit . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose the shackling of women in labor or after delivery , the suit says . The Arizona Department of Corrections , the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have all eliminated the practice . The suit claims officers violated Mendiola-Martinez 's rights , including her right to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment . Hospital staffers ' deferring to law enforcement officers regarding the shackling of women in labor and after delivery also `` demonstrates an ongoing policy of deliberate indifference to Ms. Mendiola-Martinez 's serious medical needs , '' according to the suit . It also alleges that a U.S. citizen in a similar situation would be less likely to be shackled . `` Ms. Mendiola-Martinez was subject to a lower standard of medical care -- and a higher degree of danger to her and -LRB- her -RRB- fetus -- than similarly-situated women who are United States citizens , '' the suit says . `` This disparate treatment is consistent with the findings of the United States Department of Justice regarding the systemic bias towards Latinos demonstrated by Sheriff Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office . '' Arpaio is known as `` America 's toughest sheriff '' for his stance against illegal immigration . He and his attorneys last week condemned the Justice Department civil rights investigation as politically motivated and a `` witch hunt . '' Mendiola-Martinez seeks a jury trial and damages in the suit . Journalist Valeria Fernandez in Phoenix contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"ADELAIDE , Australia -- World record-breaking wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has announced he will retire from cricket at the end of the Australian summer . Adam Gilchrist takes a spectacular catch off Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the third Test against India . The 36-year-old chose Australia Day to make his decision public , coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final Test against India in Adelaide . Gilchrist said he would retire from Tests at the end of the current match , and then hang up his gloves in one-day internationals after the upcoming tri-series with Sri Lanka and India . `` It is with great pride and happiness that I make the decision to retire from Tests and one-day internationals , '' he said in a statement on Saturday . `` I 've come to the decision after much thought and discussion with those most important to me . `` My family and I have been fortunate to have had an amazing journey full of rich experiences throughout my career and are sincerely grateful to all who have helped make this stage of our lives so fulfilling . `` I am now ready and excited to move into the next phase of my life which will , of paramount importance , include much more time with my family . '' Gilchrist broke the world record for the most wicketkeeping dismissals in Tests with 414 on Friday , overtaking South Africa 's Mark Boucher in his 96th outing in the five-day game . Boucher , by comparison , played in 109 Tests . Gilchrist took over the gloves from Ian Healy -- third on the list with 395 dismissals from 119 Tests -- in November 1999 , and went on to establish himself both as a wicketkeeper and as a batsman of brutal hitting capabilities . He has scored 5,556 runs to date , at an average of 47.89 , with a highest score of 204 not out and having made 17 centuries . He has been similarly prolific in 277 one-dayers , scoring 9,297 runs at an average of 36 and reaching three figures 15 times . Gilchrist 's revelation came as Australia put themselves in a strong position to win the series against the touring Indians , reaching 322-3 at stumps . Captain Ricky Ponting , whose team lead 2-1 , was unbeaten on 79 after adding an unbroken 81 for the fourth wicket with Michael Clarke -LRB- 37 -RRB- . Resuming the day on 62-0 in reply to India 's imposing first innings of 526 , Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques took their opening stand to 159 . Jaques was the first to fall , bowled by India captain Anil Kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries . Hayden , on his return after missing the defeat in Perth due to a hamstring injury , reached his 30th Test century before being bowled by 19-year-old seamer Ishant Sharma for 103 off 200 balls . Ponting , who came in at first drop , added another 55 with Mike Hussey before the left-hander was also castled by fast bowler Irfan Pathan for 22 to leave the home side teetering a little at 241-3 . But Ponting , who has struggled for form so far in the series , ground out his 40th half-century in Tests and Clarke provided able support to take Australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's difficult to overestimate Quincy Jones 's contribution to American music . Over the last 60 years he has excelled as a musician , composer , record producer , arranger , conductor and media company executive . Quincy Jones has won 27 Grammy awards during his extraordinary career . In a career studded with landmarks , Jones produced Michael Jackson 's multi-platinum albums `` Off The Wall , '' `` Bad '' and `` Thriller '' -- the best selling album of all time -- and produced and conducted `` We Are The World , '' one of the biggest-selling singles in history . Quincy Delight Jones Jr. , known to his friends as `` Q , '' was born on March 14 , 1933 , in Chicago . He moved to Seattle as a child and began playing trumpet aged 12 . When he was 14 he befriended a young Ray Charles , who taught him how to arrange music , and Jones was soon playing bebop in nightclubs , backing up the likes of Billie Holiday . In 1951 , Jones won a music scholarship at prestigious Schillinger House , in Boston , but he abandoned his studies to tour with bandleader Lionel Hampton . By the mid-50s , he was arranging and recording for the likes of Sarah Vaughan , Duke Ellington and his old friend Ray Charles . In 1956 he toured with Dizzy Gillespie 's Big Band , recording his first album as a leader in the same year . In 1957 , Jones moved to Paris to study music composition and theory , taking a job with Mercury Records ' French distributor to pay for his studies . After a European tour proved a financial disaster , the president of Mercury offered him a position at the record label and Jones soon became vice-president at the company . In the 60s , Jones worked as a conductor and arranger for Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald . He also began scoring music for films , including `` In the Heat of the Night , '' `` In Cold Blood '' and `` The Pawnbroker , '' which featured his hit `` Soul Bossa Nova , '' later re-used as the theme to the `` Austin Powers '' movies . Jones would go on to score 33 movies during his career and he also composed the themes for TV shows such as `` Ironside , '' `` The Bill Cosby Show '' and `` Roots , '' which earned him an Emmy award . Having made his name as a composer and arranger in the 70s , he moved away from jazz to record a series of hit albums of his own soulful music . See photos of Quincy in Seattle '' Jones 's career was dramatically put on hold in 1974 , when he suffered a severe aneurysm , but it did little to stall his incredible drive . In the 80s , as well as producing three Michael Jackson albums and `` We are the World , '' he co-produced and scored the Steven Spielberg movie `` The Color Purple , '' and formed multi-media company Quincy Jones Entertainment . In his role as CEO he was executive producer of TV series `` The Fresh Prince of Bel Air '' and published `` Vibe '' and `` SPIN '' magazines . His 1989 album `` Back On The Block '' won Album Of The Year at the Grammys and 1993 's `` Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux '' , featuring Jones conducting Miles Davis , earned another Grammy . All in all , Jones has won 27 Grammys , been nominated for seven Academy Awards , and has added to his business interests with Quincy Jones Media Group and Qwest Broadcasting . Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle , Jones has long been involved in social activism . He supported Martin Luther King 's Operation Breadbasket , which promoted economic development in the inner cities , and worked on Reverend Jesse Jackson 's People United to Save Humanity project . Jones founded the Listen Up ! Foundation , which has worked on youth projects in Los Angeles and South Africa , and he helped launch the We Are the Future project , which helps children in poor and conflict-ridden areas . He is also one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music -LRB- IBAM -RRB- , which raises money to establish a national library of African-American art and music . Over the course of his incredible career , Jones somehow found the time to marry three times and father seven children . In 1990 , his life was chronicled in the movie `` Listen Up : The Lives of Quincy Jones '' and in 2001 , Jones published `` Q : The Autobiography of Quincy Jones . '' Watch Quincy Jones on My City_My Life '' Of his own career , which has taken him from being a teenage musician in the clubs of Seattle to a world-famous music mogul , Jones says , `` You have to turn all of your drunken dreams into sober realizations .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Henry Allingham , the world 's oldest man and the oldest surviving British veteran from World War I , has died at the age of 113 , his care home said Saturday . Henry Allingham was a founding member of the modern Royal Air Force . Allingham died in his sleep at St. Dunstan 's care home in Ovingdean , England , the home said in a statement . Born on June 6 , 1896 , Allingham was active until his final days , having celebrated his 113th birthday last month on the HMS President with his family , the care home said . The Guinness Book of World Records Certified Allingham as the world 's oldest man last month , St. Dunstan 's said . Britain 's Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Gordon Brown both paid their respects to Allingham on Saturday . `` The queen was saddened to hear of the death of Henry Allingham . He was one of the unique generation who sacrificed so much for us all . Our thoughts are with his family at this time , '' Buckingham Palace said in a statement . `` I had the privilege of meeting Henry many times , '' said Brown . `` He was a tremendous character , one of the last representatives of a generation of tremendous characters . My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life . '' Born in the East End of London during the reign of Queen Victoria , Allingham was brought up by his mother and grandparents . His father died when he was a baby . He joined the Royal Naval Air Service as an aircraft mechanic in 1915 after his mother died . Allingham was the last known survivor of the Battle of Jutland , considered the greatest battle of World War I . He was serving aboard the armed trawler HMT Kingfisher , which was sent to meet up with the British fleet as it fought the Germans off what is now mainland Denmark . The battle still holds the record for the most gun-armed battleships and battlecruisers engaged in a fight , according to Britain 's Ministry of Defence . In 1917 Allingham was sent to France to support the Royal Flying Corps . His job as a mechanic was to service the aircraft and recover parts from downed planes , but pilots would often ask their mechanics to fly with them , so Allingham would sit behind the pilot and drop bombs or operate the machine gun . Allingham served in Flanders until that November , when he moved to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk , France . He stayed there until the end of the war . Allingham was a founding member of today 's Royal Air Force , which was formed in 1918 when the Royal Naval Air Service merged with the Royal Flying Corps . He married his wife , Dorothy , in late 1918 and left the RAF a few months later , in April 1919 . But Allingham remained a reservist , and during World War II he was called on to find a solution to the German magnetic mines that were bottling up the English harbor of Harwich , on the Essex coast . Allingham and his team devised an effective system to neutralize the mines , after which every ship was fitted with a neutralizing device using the system . His dedication to the military and the memory of fallen troops never wavered . In his later years especially , Allingham was often seen at memorial events , even though he could no longer walk and had to be transported in a wheelchair . `` Henry was always determined to ensure that today 's generation does not forget the sacrifice of those who died on the Western Front , '' St. Dunstan 's said in a statement after his death . `` Until recently , he regularly visited schools and attended war-based events as an ambassador for his generation . '' Asked once at a memorial ceremony how he would like to be remembered , Allingham brushed off any thought of it , saying people should instead remember those who died in the wars . `` Remember them , not me , '' he said . He was made a chevalier in France 's Legion of Honor in 2003 and was promoted to officer earlier this year . In awarding him the honor this year , the French ambassador to Britain thanked Allingham on behalf of French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his part in protecting France during both World Wars .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver , the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics , died Tuesday , the Special Olympics said . She was 88 . Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006 . Born on July 10 , 1921 , in Brookline , Massachusetts , Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy . She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics , which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962 . Today , 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations , according to the Special Olympics . `` She was the light of our lives , a mother , wife , grandmother , sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others , '' the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement . `` For each of us , she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games , to visit us in our homes , to attend to her own mother , her sisters and brothers , and to sail , tell stories , and laugh and serve her friends . '' No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements , a source close to the family said . Shriver 's husband , R. Sargent Shriver , and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died , the Special Olympics said in a statement . Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver 's life '' `` We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder , '' Brady Lum , Special Olympics president and chief operating officer , said in a statement Tuesday . `` Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement . It is an enormous loss , but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family , friends , and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed . '' Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968 , Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector . She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets . In September 1962 , Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister , Rosemary , which was published in The Saturday Evening Post . At an event honoring her in 2007 , Shriver spoke of her life : `` Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities . `` As important as it has been , it is not the whole story of my life . My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities . It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children . ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband . '' Watch Shriver reflect on her life '' At the same event , Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister , saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents , including compassion . `` She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind . She picked this up , obviously , at a very early age . All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary . '' After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945 , helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life . From 1947 to 1948 , she worked for $ 1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency . See highlights of Shriver 's public and private life '' In the early 1950s , she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago , Illinois . She married Sargent Shriver Jr. , a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant , in 1953 . The couple 's five children include California 's first lady , Maria Shriver . Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s , including Head Start and the Peace Corps . He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics . He ran President Johnson 's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 . He was Democrat George McGovern 's running mate in the 1972 presidential election . In 1957 , Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. . Foundation , which was established in 1946 to honor the family 's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people . Watch Shriver receive a special honor '' Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy . In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children , adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008 . Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s , Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp , called Camp Shriver , on her farm in Maryland . Her vision expanded over the years , and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago . She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States , including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971 . In 1981 , Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers . That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006 . Along the way , Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards , including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame 's Founder 's Award and nine honorary degrees . In 1995 , the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait . The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin . In 2009 , a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon made his third visit in a little more than a month Tuesday to the troubled border city of Juarez , where three people associated with the U.S. Consulate were killed over the weekend . Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in Mexico , with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009 . No official numbers are available , but more than 400 killings have been reported in local media this year . The city , long the focal point of Calderon 's war on drug cartels , came to renewed prominence after the January 31 killings of 15 people , most of them students with no links to organized crime . The massacre sparked outrage throughout Mexico and drew worldwide attention . Saturday 's deaths of a pregnant woman and two other people connected with the U.S. Consulate renewed attention to the blood-soaked city . Calderon visited Juarez twice in mid-February within a one-week period , meeting with local officials and residents . More such meetings were scheduled for Tuesday . Although Tuesday 's visit had been scheduled before the latest slayings , analysts say it highlights the city 's importance to the president . `` What it says is that he has really decided that success in Juarez is essential for stemming the tide of organized crime , '' said Andrew Selee , director of the Woodrow Wilson Center 's Mexico Institute . `` He has staked his presidency on success in Juarez . '' Juarez , which accounted for about one-third of the drug-related killings in Mexico last year , was already significant because of the high death count , Selee said . But the killings in January and over the weekend have elevated the city to a symbolic level , the analyst said . `` It has gained an emotional value , '' Selee said . The latest killings were carried out by a local gang known as Los Aztecas , who are allied with the Juarez Cartel , Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said . The three victims were followed and targeted , Reyes said . They were attacked as they left a birthday party at the U.S. Consulate in Juarez . U.S. and Mexican officials said a consulate employee who was four months pregnant and her husband , a U.S. citizen who was a jailer in El Paso , Texas , across the border from Juarez , were slain in their SUV . The couple 's 10-month-old daughter , who was in the vehicle , was not injured , Reyes and other officials said . Authorities identified the couple as El Paso residents Arthur Redelfs , 34 , and Lesley Ann Enriquez , 35 . Redelfs was a 10-year veteran of the El Paso County Sheriff 's Office , department spokesman Jesse Tovar said . The third victim was identified as Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros , 37 , a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee at the U.S. Consulate . His wife was not traveling with him , but two of their children , ages 4 and 7 , were in the car and were wounded , officials said . Authorities said they do n't know of a motive , nor had they made any arrests Tuesday . Widespread violence throughout northern Mexico in the past few weeks has led U.S. officials to take precautions , including the temporary relocation of State Department employees ' families in border-area consulates . The family members at U.S. consulates in Tijuana , Nogales , Ciudad Juarez , Nuevo Laredo , Monterrey and Matamoros are allowed to leave for up to 30 days , the State Department said . The leave can be renewed after 30 days . The announcement was part of a continued warning to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Mexico . U.S. citizens are advised to delay nonessential travel to parts of the states of Durango , Coahuila and Chihuahua , where Juarez is located . In addition , U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to all or parts of the three states . Attacks have included the kidnapping and killing of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua , the warning states . `` Some recent confrontations between Mexican authorities and drug cartel members have resembled small-unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades , '' the warning says . `` During some of these incidents , U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area . '' About two weeks ago , the Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step of telling college students not to visit Mexican border cities during spring break because they are too dangerous . It was the first time Texas authorities had taken that step . Canada , likewise , issued an advisory Tuesday urging citizens not to take nonessential trips to Ciudad Juarez and to `` exercise a high degree of caution '' throughout Mexico . `` Travelers are advised to reconsider their need to travel to Ciudad Juarez and should only do so if it is absolutely necessary , '' the government warning says . Asked if Ciudad Juarez is safe for visitors , Mayor Reyes laughed softly . `` We have a problem in Ciudad Juarez , '' he said . `` We ca n't deny that or lessen it . `` Normally , the violence is directed at people involved in crime , but at times , civilians are affected who are not involved in crime . '' Violence last weekend is a prime example of the extent of the problem . In the western state of Guerrero , for instance , at least 25 people were killed Saturday , state officials said . The bodies of 14 people , including nine civilians and five police officers , were found in various parts of the resort city of Acapulco , the official Notimex news agency reported , citing Guerrero Public Security Secretary Juan Heriberto Salinas . In the small city of Ajuchitlan del Progreso , 10 civilians and one soldier were killed in two shootouts that started when federal officials tried to carry out search warrants in two locations , Salinas said . The Mexican government has not released official figures , but national media said 7,600 people were killed in drug-related violence in 2009 . Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug killings in 2008 . No official figures are available , but unofficial tallies this year say more than 17,000 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the cartels after assuming office in December 2006 .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a new medal Wednesday to honor the families of British service personnel killed while serving their country . The Elizabeth Cross may be given to family members of service personnel who have died since 1948 . The Elizabeth Cross will be given to the next of kin of armed forces personnel killed on operations or as a result of terrorism `` as a mark of national recognition for their loss , '' the Defense Ministry said . It is the first time the name of a reigning monarch has been given to a new award since the queen 's father , King George VI , instituted the George Cross in 1940 . That medal recognizes acts of bravery of both civilians and military personnel . The most prestigious medal , the Victoria Cross , was introduced by Queen Victoria in 1856 for acts of gallantry by the armed forces . `` This seems to me a right and proper way of showing our enduring debt to those who are killed while actively protecting what is most dear to us all , '' the queen said in a message to the armed forces . `` The solemn dignity which we attach to the names of those who have fallen is deeply ingrained in our national character . As a people , we accord this ultimate sacrifice the highest honor and respect . '' The Elizabeth Cross is a sterling silver emblem in the shape of a cross over a wreath . In the center is the queen 's monogram , EIIR , which stands for Elizabeth II Regina , or Queen Elizabeth II . At each of the four tips of the cross are floral symbols : a rose for England , a thistle for Scotland , a shamrock for Northern Ireland , and a daffodil for Wales . The reverse of the cross will be engraved with the name of the person who died . The name will also be written on a scroll signed by the queen , to be given to family members along with the medal , the Defense Ministry said . The award may be given to family members of all service personnel who have died since 1948 . Charles Mosely , the former editor in chief of Debrett 's , an authority on etiquette , said the Elizabeth Cross is a good way to recognize the sacrifice made by members of the military and their families . `` It seems very praiseworthy and very overdue , '' he said . It makes sense for the medal to be named after the reigning monarch , he said , because she is head of the armed forces . `` They have personal allegiance to the sovereign , a personal loyalty , '' he said .","question":""}

For that matter , Fiorina said , McCain , Obama and Biden are n't capable of that kind of job either . Ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO and McCain adviser Carly Fiorina said Sarah Palin could not run a major company . The Republican presidential candidate has been trying to portray himself as someone who can fix the country 's economic woes . But that is a far different task than running a Fortune 500 corporation , Fiorina told MSNBC Tuesday . Democratic candidate Barack Obama 's camp immediately circulated copies of her words -- which did n't exactly paint their candidate in a soft light , either . `` Well , I do n't think John McCain could run a major corporation , I do n't think Barack Obama could run a major corporation , I do n't think Joe Biden could run a major corporation , '' Fiorina said . `` It is a fallacy to suggest that the country is like a company .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three former leaders of Sierra Leone 's brutal Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement were found guilty Wednesday of crimes against humanity including murder , rape , sexual slavery and forced marriages , the Special Court for Sierra Leone announced . The RUF rebels were notorious for brutality . The charges stemmed from a civil war in the diamond-rich West African nation that lasted more than 10 years and stood out for its viciousness , even on a continent that has suffered many vicious conflicts . It led to tens of thousands of deaths and more than 2 million people fleeing their homes in the country of 6 million . The RUF rebels were known for hacking off civilians ' hands and feet during the war , which lasted from March 1991 until January 2002 . Former RUF `` interim leader '' Issa Hassan Sesay , former RUF commander Morris Kallon and former RUF chief of security Augustine Gbao each faced 18 counts of war crimes , crimes against humanity , attacking U.N. peacekeepers , and recruiting and using child soldiers . Sesay and Kallon each were found guilty on 16 counts , while Gbao was found guilty on 14 , the court announced . They were charged with `` extermination , murder , rape , sexual slavery , forced marriages and physical violence '' as well as enslaving civilians , mutilating people , and pillaging . They were convicted on all counts except two specifically related to the kidnapping of international peacekeepers in May 2000 . Gbao was also found not guilty of two other charges related to an attack on peacekeepers , although Sesay and Kallon were convicted of those crimes . Human Rights Watch senior Africa researcher Corinne Dufka called the verdict `` very significant . '' `` The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days . Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation , but there was also horrific sexual violence , abductions , use of child soldiers , and forced marriages , '' she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa . She lived Sierra Leone from 1999 to 2004 , documenting atrocities . `` It was difficult to find someone who had n't been a victim of or a witness to a war crime , '' she said . Watch Jim Clancy 's report on the battle for Sierra Leone '' Amnesty International also welcomed the convictions , but said much more needs to be done to bring hundreds of other perpetrators to justice . The group called it a `` positive , but still insufficient , step in the fight against impunity '' in the country , and said `` many others -- numbering perhaps in the several hundreds -- must be investigated in Sierra Leone . '' Eight people have now been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebel 's side and some on the government 's . The Special Court 's mandate is to try only `` those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone . '' Sesay , Kallon and Gbao had pleaded not guilty on all counts in a trial that lasted nearly five years . They are due to be sentenced within a month . The Special Court can not impose the death penalty . The RUF seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers . The capital , Freetown , was retaken by international forces in 2000 . The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court , a unique joint project of Sierra Leone and the United Nations . Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague for his role in the conflict . The prosecution rested in the Taylor case last month after a year of presenting its arguments . The Leonardo DiCaprio movie `` Blood Diamond '' is set in Sierra Leone during the civil war . Despite the country 's diamond wealth , 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line .

Watch Huckabee bow out '' McCain is slated to go to the White House on Wednesday to receive the endorsement of President Bush , according to two Republican sources . The Arizona senator 's campaign -- his second run for the White House -- was largely written off for dead last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party 's conservative base , a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising . But McCain said earlier Tuesday that he was confident he would emerge as the presumptive nominee by the end of the night .

Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday , according to Sri Lankan Army sources . A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday . Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country 's northeastern coast . Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area , but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of `` fresh displacement '' has now exceeded 100,000 individuals . `` In the face of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and in response to the calls made by the U.N. , EU , the governments of the USA , India and others , the -LRB- LTTE -RRB- has announced an unilateral cease-fire . All of LTTE 's offensive military operations will cease with immediate effect , '' the rebel leaders said in a written statement issued earlier Sunday . `` We welcome the attempts by the U.N. and its agencies to assist the civilian population and are ready to engage and cooperate with them to address the humanitarian needs of the population . ... We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease-fire . '' The Tiger leadership asked the international community to `` pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate '' on the cease-fire offer . The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka 's northeast since 1983 . As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began , and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries , including the United States and the European Union .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dutch striker Robin van Persie continued his superb scoring streak this season , netting another double as Arsenal beat German champions Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the European Champions League to clinch top spot in Group F and secure qualification for the last 16 . Captain Van Persie had already found the net 15 times for Arsenal this season , and he added another one to his tally in the 49th minute when he headed home after some superb individual play on the left from Alex Song . And Van Persie wrapped up a comfortable night for the Gunners when scoring his 17th goal from just 18 matches , tapping home from close range after Mikel Arteta 's corner had been flicked on at the near post by Thomas Vermaelen . Dortmund did pull one back through Shinji Kagawa with the final kick of the game , but it was too late to make a difference as Arsenal made it eight wins and a draw from their last nine matches , following a poor start to the season . Andre-Villas Boas needs to be given more time Arsenal are on 11 points , four clear of Greek champions Olympiakos , who stunned Marseille 1-0 in France . Koannis Fetfatzidis netted a late winner to leave Olympiakos third on six points , one point behind Marseille , with Dortmund bottom of the table on four points . However , there is a scenario that could see all those teams finish on seven points , if Olympiakos draw with Arsenal and Dortmund defeat Marseille in the final group matches in a fortnight . Meanwhile , there was drama in Group E , with Bayer Leverkusen scoring a last-gasp winner against Chelsea to virtually secure their place in the last 16 with a 2-1 victory . An injury time header from defender Manuel Friedrich saw the home side fight back from going a goal down , to inflict Chelsea 's fourth defeat in seven matches and increase the pressure on under-fire manager Andre Villas-Boas . The visitors went ahead three minutes after the break when Didier Drogba turned smartly in the area before firing into the bottom corner of the net . But the German side levelled in the 73rd minute when substitute Eren Derdiyok headed into an empty net after goalkeeper Petr Cech came off his line to try and intercept Sidney Sam 's superb cross . And Friedrich rose highest from a corner in the dying stages to secure a stunning comeback for Leverkusen . That result leaves Leverkusen on nine points , one clear of Chelsea and Valencia , who crushed Genk 7-0 at the Mestalla stadium . Roberto Soldado scored a first-half hat-trick for the Spanish side to leave qualification finely poised . If Chelsea beat Valencia , or draw 0-0 at Stamford Bridge in their final match , they will qualify , while Leverkusen need to avoid defeat against Genk to also go through . Defending champions Barcelona had already secured qualification , but a 3-2 victory over Milan at the San Siro ensured they will go through as Group H winners , with Milan in second place . Barca took a 14th minute lead when Mark van Bommel turned Seydou Keita 's cross into his own net but Milan leveled six minutes later when Barca old boy Zlatan Ibrahimovic 's shot crept under goalkeeper Victor Valdes . Lionel Messi restored Barca 's lead from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Alberto Aquilani had fouled Xavi in the area , but once again Milan equalized with a superb individual goal from Kevin-Prince Boateng . However , Barca were not to be denied and they clinched the win when Messi picked out Xavi , who expertly slotted home . In the other group game , Czech side Viktoria Plzen secured their first-ever competition win with a 1-0 success at BATE Borisov , to move onto four points , while BATE remain bottom on two points . Meanwhile , outsiders APOEL Nicosia have become the first Cypriot club to reach the last 16 after a 0-0 Group G draw at Russian side Zenit St Petersburg . APOEL , who were completely unfancied going into the group stage , held their nerve in a highly-charged atmosphere , which saw play halted twice when smoke bombs covered the whole pitch making it impossible to carry on . The result means APOEL have nine points from their five matches , one ahead of Zenit and two clear of Porto , who won 2-0 at Shakhtar Donetsk in the other group match . Porto entertain Zenit in their final group game , with the winners going through alongside APOEL , although a draw would also see Zenit go through .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness . A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo . That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals , including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas . The 452-page report states that `` scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans . '' The report , compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ' Illnesses , fails to identify any cure for the malady . It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time . `` Today 's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War , '' said Anthony Hardie , a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare . `` This is a bittersweet victory , -LSB- because -RSB- this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along , '' Hardie said at a news conference in Washington . `` Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans . '' The committee 's report , titled `` Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans , '' was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake . Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a `` renewed federal research commitment '' to `` identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . '' Watch CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen report more on Gulf War illness '' According to the report , Gulf War illness is a `` complex of multiple concurrent symptoms '' that `` typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems , chronic headaches , widespread pain , gastrointestinal problems , and other chronic abnormalities . '' The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- ALS -RRB- -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts . The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple `` biological alterations '' affecting the brain and nervous system . iReport.com : Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness ? While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease , it is , according to the report , no longer difficult to identify a cause . The report identifies two Gulf War `` neurotoxic '' exposures that `` are causally associated with Gulf War illness . '' The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide -LRB- PB -RRB- pills , given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents . The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict . The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link . The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran 's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time . `` Gulf War illness is n't some imaginary syndrome , '' said Ken Robinson , the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97 . `` This is real , and it has devastated families . Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration . Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again . '' Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness , because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991 . The report backs Robinson 's conclusion , noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq . The committee report also backs Robinson 's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness . Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a `` renewed federal research commitment '' to `` identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . '' Specifically , the report calls for at least $ 60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans .","question":""}
{"answer":"PRETORIA , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States no longer supports a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe and the country 's main opposition because a viable unity government is not possible with Mugabe in power , a top U.S. diplomat said Sunday . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe , in a speech to supporters Saturday , refused calls to step down . The statement from U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer follows recent calls from President Bush and other world leaders for Mugabe to abandon power amid a growing cholera epidemic that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 people in recent months . Frazer visited southern Africa to articulate the change in U.S. policy toward Mugabe at the request of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . She made the comments Sunday during a roundtable discussion with journalists in Pretoria , South Africa , before her expected return to the United States later in the day . She called for a new vote in Zimbabwe . `` Fresh elections are necessary but not possible under the current environment , '' Frazer told reporters . Zimbabwe has had no Cabinet since the March presidential election , during which no candidate won enough votes to avoid a runoff , according to the government . After opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from a June runoff , saying Mugabe 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence against opposition supporters , Tsvangirai and Mugabe reached a power-sharing agreement that has yet to be implemented . The political impasse has aggravated the country 's humanitarian and economic crisis , including a cholera outbreak that began in August . Frazer said that during her trip , she consulted with the leaders of Zimbabwe 's neighbors who are stuck between their concerns about Mugabe 's grip on power and their support of the power-sharing agreement , which they still think is the best way to deal with the crisis without creating a backlash . Frazer said she believes it could be weeks before African leaders put pressure on Mugabe to step down , which she said could be achieved by simply telling him with one voice that he should go . She said the U.N. Security Council will deal with the issue of Zimbabwe next month . This time , she said , South Africa will not be able to block resolutions calling for more sanctions because South Africa will no longer hold a seat on the council in 2009 . Watch what options the international community has in Zimbabwe `` The South African government will be held responsible for what is happening in Zimbabwe because they are the country with the most influence in Zimbabwe than any other in the world , '' Frazer said . The Security Council 's recent failure to impose sanctions on Mugabe 's regime drew scoffs from the 84-year-old Mugabe , who has accused Britain -- Zimbabwe 's former colonizer -- of trying to take over the country to get its resources . Tsvangirai said Friday that his party will withdraw from efforts to form a unity government unless 42 party members who have been kidnapped are either released or brought to court to face formal charges by New Year 's Day . Mugabe 's ZANU-PF party and the Movement for Democratic Change , led by Tsvangirai , have failed to implement the September 15 power-sharing deal because they can not agree on who should control key ministries . Under the deal , brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki , Mugabe would remain president while Tsvangirai would become Zimbabwe 's prime minister . There had been hope that a unity government would reverse Mugabe 's policies , which are widely blamed for the country 's economic crisis . Mugabe blames economic sanctions imposed by Western nations for Zimbabwe 's economic collapse . Zimbabwe , once the breadbasket of Africa , is now a net importer of food and facing acute shortages of most essentials such as fuel , electricity and medical drugs . Its inflation rate -- the highest in the world -- is officially at 231 million percent . Last week , Zimbabwe 's central bank introduced a $ 10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars . Mugabe has repeatedly refused calls from Western leaders to step down , most recently telling his supporters late Saturday that he would not follow the U.S. president to his `` political death . '' `` They now want to topple the Mugabe government . Mugabe must go because Bush is going , '' he said in his address Saturday to his party 's 10th annual conference outside Zimbabwe 's capital , Harare . `` Zimbabweans will refuse that one of their sons must accompany Bush to his political death , '' Mugabe said . `` Is it a ritual now that Bush with his political death must be accompanied by some African from Zimbabwe , and that African must be the leader himself , and that leader is Mugabe ? '' Mugabe did not mention the cholera epidemic , which his government has said is under control despite the United Nations ' assessment that half the country 's population may be at risk . There are more than 20,000 suspected cases of the water-borne disease in Zimbabwe , and the U.N. said it fears that number will triple by the time the rainy season ends in April . In addition to Bush , the leaders of Britain , France and several African countries have called on Mugabe to abandon power and let a national unity government take over to help prevent the cholera epidemic from spilling across Zimbabwe 's borders .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attackers launched assaults across Iraq over the past 24 hours , killing 11 police recruits and six civilians , including a 7-year-old . Iraqi and U.S. troops conduct a joint patrol Monday in the northern city of Mosul during a push against insurgents . Also , the U.S. military said it killed an al Qaeda in Iraq leader in northern Iraq . The violence erupted as a peace agreement was taking hold in Baghdad 's Sadr City , for weeks the scene of battles between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias . A suicide bomber exploded his vest outside the house of an Awakening Council leader , Sheikh Mutleb al-Nadawi , about 50 miles -LRB- 80 kilometers -RRB- east of Baquba in Diyala province , the military command in Diyala said . Al-Nadawi was in the house and escaped injury , but a 7-year-old was killed and two of al-Nadawi 's bodyguards were wounded . Awakening Councils are the U.S.-backed Sunni groups that oppose al Qaeda in Iraq . A mortar round landed on a busy outdoor market in Balad Ruz , about 25 miles -LRB- 40 kilometers -RRB- east of Baquba . Three civilians were killed , and nine were wounded . A bomb exploded Tuesday inside a minibus in southeastern Baghdad 's Rustumiya district , killing two passengers and wounding five , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said . Insurgents also attacked a minibus filled with police recruits Monday in Baaj , a Nineveh province town near the Syrian border , killing 11 people , according to Mosul police . Iraqi security forces arrested 15 people in connection with the attack . Backed by U.S. soldiers , Iraqi forces have been conducting an offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq in Mosul and the rest of Nineveh province . American-led coalition troops killed a senior al Qaeda in Iraq leader east of Samarra in northern Iraq on Tuesday , the U.S. military said . Meanwhile , the agreement forged to end the weeks of fighting in the capital 's Sadr City is taking hold , government officials and witnesses said . Thousands of soldiers and police officers have moved deep inside the restive neighborhood without resistance from Shiite militia members who have been fighting Iraqi and U.S. troops . The troops have been clearing mines and soon will begin the process of confiscating weapons , officials said . No violence has been reported in the area since Monday . Much of the earlier fighting involved the Mehdi Army militia of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and security forces dominated by a rival political party , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq . The latter is the leading party in the government 's United Iraqi Alliance bloc . The agreement , hammered out between the United Iraqi Alliance and the Sadrists , is intended to clear the neighborhood of weaponry and outlaws and restore stability to the area . Tahseen al-Sheikhly , civilian spokesman for Baghdad 's security plan , said there has been great cooperation among residents , Sadrist supporters and government forces . Gen. Qassim Atta , the military spokesman of Baghdad 's security plan , said Tuesday that checkpoints and patrols have been established and coalition forces are ready to help Iraqi troops , but they have not entered Sadr City . Elsewhere in Baghdad , the trial of Saddam Hussein-era officials Tariq Aziz , Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- also known as Chemical Ali -- and six others resumed Tuesday . They are facing charges in connection with the executions of 42 Iraqi merchants in 1992 . CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .","question":""}

Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider break down the numbers '' Last month , Americans were almost evenly divided between those who support the war and those who oppose it , the poll showed , with 47 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed . Opposition to the war in Afghanistan is more muted than opposition to the war in Iraq , but it 's not so muted among Democrats . Two-thirds of Americans overall oppose the war in Iraq , but 64 percent of Democrats oppose the war in Afghanistan . The anti-war movements in Vietnam and Iraq helped define what the Democratic Party stands for . Watch : Is Afghanistan Obama 's Vietnam ? '' `` If we do n't learn from our Iraq experience , we are doomed to repeat it , '' Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D-California , said on the House floor Thursday . Why are Americans wary about Afghanistan ? The recession . Iraq War fatigue . And frustration . Only 31 percent of Americans believe the United States is winning the war in Afghanistan . Fifty percent believe the United States is winning in Iraq -- the highest number in at least five years . But Americans still want to get out of Iraq . Last month , when President Obama said he would send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , the public was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt . Democrats were willing to go along with the president , but they were less enthusiastic than Republicans A solid majority of Americans believe the United States can win a military victory in Afghanistan , but Afghanistan has become a political war . Winning depends , not just on what the United States can do , but also what Afghanistan and Pakistan can do . Americans have far less confidence in them .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former U.S. military contractor has pleaded guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme involving Army contracting officials , the Department of Justice said . Terry Hall , 43 , of Snellville , Georgia , pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy in federal court in Birmingham , Alabama , on Wednesday , the department said in a release . Hall ran several companies that received $ 21 million as part of contracts with the Department of Defense , prosecutors said . `` To obtain the contracting business and facilitate unlawful payments by other contractors , Hall admitted he made more than $ 3 million in unlawful payments and provided other valuable items and services to U.S. Army contracting officials '' stationed at Camp Arifjan , an Army base in Kuwait , authorities said . The case against Hall stemmed from `` a wide-ranging investigation of corruption at the Camp Arifjan contracting office , '' authorities said . Hall is the eighth person to enter a guilty plea in connection with the bribery scheme . Hall 's companies , including Freedom Consulting and Catering Co. and Total Government Allegiance , provided goods and services to the Department of Defense in connection with the Iraq war , according to court documents . The companies received a `` blanket purchase agreement '' to deliver bottled water in Iraq and a contract to build a security fence in Kuwait , authorities said . Such an agreement is `` an indefinite delivery , indefinite quantity contract by which the DoD agrees to pay a contractor a specified price for a particular good or service , '' according to the Department of Justice . `` Based on a -LRB- blanket purchase agreement -RRB- , the DoD is permitted to order the supplies on an as-needed basis , and the contractor is bound by the price agreed upon in the -LRB- agreement -RRB- . '' Hall faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the money laundering conspiracy charge and a maximum of five years on the bribery conspiracy charge , plus a $ 250,000 fine on each charge . In addition , Hall agreed to forfeit some $ 15.7 million to the U.S. government . It was unclear when he is scheduled to be sentenced . Others who have pleaded guilty in the probe include former Maj. James Momon , who according to court documents arranged for Hall 's companies to receive $ 6.4 million worth of orders for bottled water . As a result , Hall paid Momon more than $ 300,000 , the Department of Justice said . Momon pleaded guilty in August 2008 to receiving bribes from contractors at the base and is awaiting sentencing . Another is former Maj. John Cockerham , who arranged for Hall 's companies to receive $ 2.6 million in bottled water orders . Hall paid Cockerham about $ 800,000 , authorities said . He was sentenced in December to more than 17 years in prison and ordered to pay $ 9.6 million in restitution . Hall was indicted in May along with Army Maj. Eddie Pressley and Pressley 's wife , Eurica . The indictment against the Pressleys says they received more than $ 2.8 million in cash and other items from Hall `` in exchange for Eddie Pressley 's agreement to take official actions to benefit Hall , '' the Department of Justice said . Eurica Pressley allegedly arranged for a company named EGP Business Solutions Inc. to be incorporated , opened a bank account in the business ' name in the United States , the United Arab Emirates and the Cayman Islands , according to the indictment .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former `` Manson family '' member who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and is now terminally ill faces her 13th parole hearing on Wednesday . Susan Atkins , shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders , has a parole hearing Wednesday . Susan Atkins , 61 , has terminal brain cancer . As of earlier this year , she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair , according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse . However , despite her declining health and an impressive prison record , Whitehouse wrote , `` there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society . '' The hearing will be held at the Central California Women 's Facility at Chowchilla , California , said Terry Thornton , spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness . Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders '' `` Last we heard , she is expected to attend , '' Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins . The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room , but depending on Atkins ' condition , it could be held at her bedside , Thornton said . The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors , she said . Atkins -- California 's longest-serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously , Thornton said . She was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969 . She and the others -- Manson , Leslie Van Houten , Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles `` Tex '' Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people , including Tate , and two additional deaths the following night . Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation 's death penalty laws in 1972 . By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , and stabbed the actress , who was eight months pregnant , 16 times . In a 1993 parole board hearing , Atkins said Tate `` asked me to let her baby live . ... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . '' After killing Tate , according to historical accounts of the murders , Atkins scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband , director Roman Polanski . Polanski was not home at the time , but three of Tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his nearby cottage . If the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a `` tentative suitability finding '' -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings , Thornton said . If it still stands , the matter then goes to the governor 's office . The governor 's options include allowing the decision to stand , actively approving it , modifying it or reversing it , according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 's Web site . However , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins ' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death . The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008 . It was also opposed by Debra Tate , Sharon Tate 's sister . If parole is not granted , another hearing will be set in three , five , seven , 10 or 15 years , at the discretion of the panel , Thornton said . Atkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson . But Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free , saying the slayings were `` so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back . '' `` The ` Manson Family ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , '' Debra Tate said . `` They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die . There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the ` Manson Family . ' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do . '' In a manuscript posted on her Web site , Atkins , who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz , wrote that `` this is the past I have to live with , and I have to live with it every day . '' `` Unlike the reader , or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool , I ca n't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life . Just like the families and friends of the victims , this is with me every day . I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away . And that 's not ` neat , ' and that 's not ` cool . ' '' Atkins ' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008 , Whitehouse wrote on his Web site . On May 15 , doctors predicted she would live less than six months . But she passed that deadline , he wrote , and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unsanitary conditions at a Colorado cantaloupe farm 's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation 's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food , the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday . Meanwhile , a Centers for Disease Control official said it is too early to declare the outbreak over , but the number of new cases appeared to be diminishing . `` The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September , '' said Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC , who added that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks . The FDA said it was unable to pinpoint the definitive cause of the outbreak , which has been linked to 25 deaths so far . An FDA letter to Jensen Farms of Granada , Colorado , however , cited violations in sanitary conditions that must be addressed . It said tests showed `` widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility . '' The agency cited several likely causes of the spread of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria at Jensen Farms . The likely causes included packing equipment that `` was not easily cleaned and sanitized '' and the use of washing and drying equipment for cantaloupe packing as well as other raw agricultural commodities . In addition , the agency said in a statement , the facility lacked a `` pre-cooling step '' to remove field heat from the cantaloupes before cold storage , possibly leading to condensation in the cooling process that promoted growth of the listeria bacteria . A letter dated Tuesday from the FDA to Jensen Farms cited violations in sanitary conditions . The letter said tests at the facility found listeria bacteria contamination . `` These positive swabs were taken from different locations throughout the washing and packing areas in your facility , all of which were either food contact surfaces or areas adjacent to food contact surfaces , '' the letter said . `` This significant percentage of swabs that tested positive for outbreak strains of Listeria monocytogenes demonstrates widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility . '' According to the letter , the company has 15 days to document steps it has taken to correct the problems . The letter also said the company notified the FDA on Monday that it agreed to inspection by the agency of its growing , packaging , and cold storage operations before it resumes food harvesting , packaging , or processing . Jensen Farms also agreed to correct all objectionable observations noted during said FDA inspections , the letter said . A total of 123 people in 26 states have been infected by the listeria outbreak , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says . Additionally , a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage , the agency said . The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998 . Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults , people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women . Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14 . The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves , the CDC has said . Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately , even if some of them have been eaten , the agency recommended . If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe , they are urged to ask their supermarket . If the source remains unknown , the fruit should be thrown out . Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria , which can grow at low temperatures , and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- English Premier League form side Tottenham are on the brink of going out of the Europa League after Greek outfit PAOK Salonika claimed a shock 2-1 Group A victory at White Hart Lane . Tottenham have been in superb form in recent weeks , winning nine of their last 10 league games to move up to third place in the table . However , their European form has not been as strong , and this month 's 1-0 reverse at Rubin Kazan was followed by another defeat on Wednesday to leave Harry Redknapp 's side needing PAOK to win their last game next month in order to help Tottenham achieve qualification through to the last 32 . The visitors went ahead in the sixth minute when an unmarked Dimitris Salpingidis guided the ball home from Giorgos Georgiadis ' right-wing cross . And PAOK doubled their lead seven minutes later when Stefanos Athanasiadis tapped home from close range after more suspect Spurs marking . The home side pulled one back seven minutes before the break when Luka Modric scored from the penalty spot after Konstantinos Stafylidis was dismissed for handball on the line . However , despite having a numerical advantage for the whole of the second half , Tottenham failed to find the goal they needed . The result means PAOK are top on 11 points and have qualified for the last 32 knockout stage . Russian side Rubin Kazan are second on 10 points after thrashing Shamrock Rovers 4-1 in the other group game . For Spurs to qualify , they will now need to win heavily at Shamrock in their final match , and hope Rubin Kazan are beaten at PAOK in the other tie . Also through to the last 32 are 2010 winners Atletico Madrid , after the Spanish side won 1-0 at Celtic in Group I thanks to a superb long-range strike from Turkish international Arda Turan on the half-hour mark . The other match between Rennes of France and Italians Udinese ended 0-0 , a result that means Atletico have qualified with 10 points ahead of the final round of matches . Udinese are second on eight points and they will secure their place in the knockout round if they draw at home to Celtic in their final game , with the Scottish side needing a victory to progress . Group C is the only group where both qualifiers have now been decided , after PSV Eindhoven won 3-0 at Legia Warsaw . That result means both sides have gone through , on 13 points and nine points respectively . Romanians Rapid Bucharest needed to beat Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv at home to retain any hope , but they were beaten 3-1 . Another side to reach the knockout stage is Standard Liege , who saw off Germans Hannover 2-0 to make it three wins and two draws from their five Group B matches so far . The Belgian outfit are on 11 points , three ahead of Hannover , who need a point from their final match against Vorskla Poltava to also secure qualification . Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkov continued their impressive run of form in the competition , thumping Austria Vienna 4-1 to secure their qualification from Group G with 13 points from their five matches . Malmo and AZ Alkmaar drew 0-0 in the other match to leave Alkmaar needing to beat Kharkov in their final match to join their opponents in the last 32 . However , there is all to play for in Group H , with any two of three teams still able to qualify . Last year 's beaten finalists Sporting Braga beat Birmingham City 1-0 , while a remarkable match in Slovenia saw Bruges of Belgium fight back from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in injury time against Maribor . That means Bruges and Braga are level on 10 points and they play each other in the final match . A draw there will see them both qualify with Birmingham , who are three points behind in third place , needing to beat Maribor in their final match and hoping the other game does not end in a draw . There was a suprise result in the English League Cup quarterfinals , where Manchester United were beaten 2-1 at home by Championship side Crystal Palace in extra time . That result means Palace now play fellow-second tier side Cardiff City in the semifinals , while Premier League giants Liverpool and Manchester City face each other in the second semifinal .","question":""}

The figures are estimates , a campaign spokesman said . `` We 're still calculating . '' Sources in Sen. Hillary Clinton 's campaign said the New York senator raised $ 20 million in March . Impressive as the $ 40 million figure is , it is well below the $ 55 million Obama raised in February .

Official reports said Kercher may have been sexually assaulted before she died and that she bled to death . Members of Kercher 's family spoke to reporters following the court proceeding . John Kercher Jr. , one of the woman 's brothers , said it was `` overwhelming '' to be in the same room as Guede when the judge convicted and sentenced him . But Lyle Kercher , a second brother , said that `` pleased '' was n't the right word for the family 's feelings , noting that his sister was murdered . `` Satisfied '' was more appropriate given the circumstances , he said . At his lawyers ' request , Guede , hoping for a lesser sentence , received a separate fast-track trial from Knox and Sollecito . Lawyers for Sollecito , 24 , and Knox , 21 , asked that their clients -- who have been in jail since shortly after the murder -- be allowed to stay under house arrest if indicted . However , Sollecito 's attorney , Luca Maori , and Knox 's attorney , Carlo Dalla Vedova , said the judge had not ruled on their request . They expect an answer in coming days , they said . Prosecutors allege Guede committed sexual violence against Kercher with the help of Knox and Sollecito . They have said the three then strangled and stabbed the British student and took money , credit cards and cell phones in an attempt to make it look like the crime occurred during a robbery . Guede has admitted being in the villa when Kercher was killed , but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room . Police say a bloody footprint from a shoe next to Kercher 's body came from Sollecito . They also say investigators found traces of blood belonging to both Knox and Kercher mixed together in a bathroom adjacent to the room where Kercher died . Both Knox and Sollecito have given what prosecutors have said are confusing and contradictory accounts of what happened the night Kercher was killed .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A three-judge federal appeals court panel Tuesday overturned a lower court 's order blocking key parts of a Texas law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion , potentially clearing the way for enforcement of the law . In August , just before the law was set to take effect September 1 , U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin , Texas , found several portions of the law `` unconstitutionally vague , '' and ruled it violated the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech . But a panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Sparks ' injunction against enforcing the law , saying opponents did not prove it violated the Constitution . The panel remanded the suit back to the lower court for further proceedings . As written , the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure . Sparks ' injunction blocked Texas from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who failed to place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them , or does not make the fetus ' heartbeat audible . It also blocked penalties against the woman . A previous U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Pennsylvania case `` held that the fact that such truthful , accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision , '' U.S. Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a concurring opinion . `` Insisting that a doctor give this information in his traditional role of securing informed consent is permissible . '' `` Today 's ruling is a victory for all who stand in defense of life , '' Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement . `` Every life lost to abortion is a tragedy , and this important sonogram legislation ensures that every Texas woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying , and understands the devastating impact of such a life-ending decision . `` We will continue to fight any attempt to limit our state 's laws that value and protect the unborn , '' Perry said . The suit was filed by the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights . Nancy Northrup , the center 's president and CEO , said the court decision was `` extreme . '' `` This clears the way for the enforcement of an insulting and intrusive law whose sole purpose is to harass women and dissuade them from exercising their constitutionally protected reproductive rights , '' Northrup said in a statement . `` Until today , every court that has reviewed similarly intrusive laws have ruled the laws unconstitutional . '' The law , she said , `` serves only to place multiple hurdles between women and the free and full exercise of their reproductive rights . '' The center , she said , is evaluating `` all available means '' to challenge the Texas law `` and all laws that seek to undermine women 's fundamental rights . '' The bill generated some controversy in Texas , but easily passed through the state 's House and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed , women must undergo a sonogram , a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image . The doctor is required to give , `` in a manner understandable to a layperson , a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images , including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus , the presence of cardiac activity and the presence of external members and internal organs , '' the law says .

{"answer":"ROME , Italy -- Italian tennis players Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali have been banned by the ATP for betting on matches . Top Italian player Potito Starace has been suspended for six weeks for betting on matches . The country 's top player Starace -- 31st in the ATP rankings -- has been suspended for six weeks from January 1 and fined $ 30,000 -LRB- 20,890 euros -RRB- for making five bets totalling around 90 euros two years ago . Bracciali , world ranked 258 , has been banned for three months and fined $ 20,000 -LRB- 13,930 euros -RRB- for making around 50 five-euro bets between 2004 and 2005 . The Italian Tennis Federation -LRB- FIT -RRB- confirmed the news on its website , www.federtennis.it . However , they denounced the penalties as disproportionate , saying the players never bet on their own matches . `` Injustice is done , '' the statement said . `` These penalties are absolutely , excessively severe compared to the magnitude of the violations carried out by the two players . '' The federation said the two were not aware of the ATP 's betting regulations , and that they stopped placing the bets as soon as they learned it was against the rules . Another Italian player , Alessio Di Mauro , became the first player sanctioned under the ATP 's new anti-corruption rules when he received a nine-month ban in November , also for betting on matches . Starace and Bracciali said they were scapegoats for a larger match-fixing scandal . `` It 's disgusting , '' said the 26-year-old Starace . `` The ATP does n't know where to turn . It 's all a joke . '' Bracciali said the two had been `` sacrificed . '' `` That 's why they came after us , '' the 29-year-old said . `` We are not champions and we do n't count in the upper echelons . '' ATP officials could not be reached for comment on Saturday . Concerns about match-fixing have risen since August , when an online betting company reported unusual betting patterns during a match between fourth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina . The company , Betfair , voided all bets and the ATP has been investigating . Davydenko , who retired while trailing in the third set , denies wrongdoing . Since then , several players have said that they had been approached with offers to fix matches in exchange for money . E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former terrorist suspects detained by the United States were tortured , according to medical examinations detailed in a report released Wednesday by a human rights group . A U.S. serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003 . The Massachusetts-based Physicians for Human Rights reached that conclusion after two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees , who had been held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Afghanistan . The detainees were never charged with crimes . `` We found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering , '' said Dr. Allen Keller , a medical evaluator for the study . In a 121-page report , the doctors ' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture , including beatings , electric shock , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , sodomy and scores of other abuses . The report is prefaced by retired U.S. Major Gen. Antonio Taguba , who led the Army 's investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003 . Watch why a rights group says there 's evidence of torture '' `` There is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes , '' Taguba says . `` The only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . '' Over the years , reports of abuses at Abu Ghraib and allegations of torture at Guantanamo prompted the Bush administration to deny that the U.S. military tortures detainees . Since only 11 detainees were examined `` the findings of this assessment can not be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in U.S. custody , '' the report says . However , the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment , `` making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused , but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in U.S. custody . '' Four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to Afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to Guantanamo Bay , where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge , the report says . The other seven were detained in Iraq in 2003 and released within a year , the report says . All the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that `` often occurred in combination over a long period of time , '' the report says . While the report presents synopses of the detainees ' backgrounds based on interviews with them , the authors did not have access to the detainees ' medical histories . Therefore , there 's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained . Among the ex-detainees was an Iraqi in his mid-40s , identified only as Laith , whom U.S. soldiers took into custody in October 2003 and who was released from Abu Ghraib in June 2004 . According to the report , Laith was subjected to sleep deprivation , electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family . `` They took off even my underwear . They asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs . ... They were trying to make me look like an animal , '' Laith told examiners , according to the report . According to the report , Laith said the most `` painful '' experiences involved threats to his family : `` And they asked me , ` Have you ever heard voices of women in this prison ? ' I answered , ` Yes . ' They were saying , ` Then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them . ' '' The examiners concluded in the report that `` Laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at Abu Ghraib prison . '' Another detainee , Youssef , was detained by U.S. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan without a passport , the report says . He initially was held in an Afghan prison , where he describes `` being stripped naked , being intimidated by dogs , being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions , '' the report says . A few months later , he was taken to the Guantanamo Bay facility , where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet , the report says . Youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the Taliban , the report says . Based on its investigation , the report calls on the U.S. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in Afghanistan , Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere . The rights group also demands that the Bush administration : \u2022 `` Repudiate all forms of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment '' ; \u2022 Establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at U.S.-run prisons in Afghanistan , Iraq and Guantanamo Bay ; \u2022 Hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes ; and \u2022 Monitor thoroughly the conditions at U.S.-run prisons all over the world .

{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan announced a 10-day cease-fire on Sunday in Pakistan 's Swat Valley , a volatile region in North West Frontier Province that is largely controlled by the Taliban . The Taliban says it has agreed a 10-day cease-fire with Pakistani forces in the Swat Valley . The Taliban are holding talks with the North West Frontier Province 's government in the town of Timagera in the province 's Lower Dir district , he said . Taliban leader Sufi Mohammad is heading negotiations for the militants . There was no immediate confirmation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani government . Swat Valley was once Pakistan 's biggest tourist destination until it was overrun by militants led by radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah . The valley boasted the country 's only ski resort and was once a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts . It is believed to be the deepest advance by militants into Pakistan 's settled areas -- meaning areas outside its tribal region along the border with Afghanistan . The negotiations are the latest attempt by Pakistan 's civilian government -- which took power last year -- to achieve peace through diplomacy in areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein . Swat has been overrun by forces loyal to Maulana Fazlullah 's banned hardline Islamic group , Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi -LRB- TNSM -RRB- which has allied itself with Taliban fighters . TNSM was once led by Sufi Mohammed , Fazlullah 's father-in-law who is leading the latest negotiations . Sufi Mohammed was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government . He had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan . Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed 's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region . Last May , Pakistan 's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley . Analysts as well as critics within the establishment have described those talks as a failure that gave the Taliban time to regroup and gain more ground . The Taliban have recently targeted local politicians , including the head of the Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- who was forced to flee to Islamabad . Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders , blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants . Pakistan 's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis , but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past . Pakistan 's previous military ruler , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and Taliban a stronger foothold in the region .

{"answer":"The Hague , Netherlands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bosnian war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic launched a full-throated attack on the International War Crimes Tribunal Tuesday , as he appeared at a hearing to discuss his refusal to appear for trial . He said he `` can not take part in something that has been bad from the start , and where my fundamental rights have been violated . '' Karadzic , who is accused of responsibility for the worst massacre in Europe since World War II , says he has had insufficient time to prepare his defense . He is representing himself . But Judge O-Gon Kwon told Karadzic it was the court , not the defendant , who decides when the case is ready for trial . He advised Karadzic to participate in order to get a fair trial . The judges will decide by the end of the week how to deal with the former Bosnian leader 's boycott of the proceedings , Judge Kwon said before adjourning the trial for the day . Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb leader during the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s , faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . Memories of the massacre remain raw . Watch the video The charges stem partly from the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys at the town of Srebrenica , in what is know Bosnia and Herzegovina , in 1995 . Karadzic has been insisting he has not had enough time to prepare for the trial , saying there are 1.3 million pages of documents to study . He denied stalling , and said imposing a lawyer on him would not help . `` It is with joy that I am preparing for these proceedings , '' he said through a translator . `` Nobody can get through this material better than I can , no lawyer . The best possible solution would be that the defense be given sufficient time '' to prepare . He rejected prosecutor Hildegard Uertz-Retzlaff 's assertion that Tuesday 's proceedings constituted part of the trial . `` I hope that this is not some kind of a trick , '' he said . `` I am attending a status conference hearing . '' The court can not force a defendant to appear . Karadzic , as a `` self-representing accused , '' is the only one who can cross-examine witnesses and speak in court about the substance of the charges against him . However , judges can impose a lawyer on Karadzic if he continues to refuse to cooperate . The trial began without his presence on October 26 , more than a year after Karadzic was captured in Belgrade , the capital of Serbia . He had been on the run for more than 13 years and was living in disguise in Belgrade , practicing alternative medicine at a clinic . Karadzic faces life in prison if he is convicted . The court can not impose the death penalty . The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations . Karadzic was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office . Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague .","question":""}
{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal government moved Thursday to seize assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp . , including a Manhattan skyscraper and four mosques , citing alleged links to the Iranian government . Preet Bharara , the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , announced Thursday 's filing of an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of the Alavi Foundation 's interest in the 36-story office tower located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan . The tower is owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company , a partnership between the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. , the Justice Department said . The amended complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli , Iran 's largest state-owned financial entity . U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force , considered terrorist groups by the United States . Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in any deceptive banking practices . Thursday 's amended complaint seeks forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. , including bank accounts owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company , the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. ; and properties owned by the foundation in New York , Maryland , Virginia , Texas and California . It alleges that the properties were `` involved in and -LSB- were -RSB- the proceeds of money laundering offenses , '' and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations . `` As today 's complaint alleges in great detail , the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran , '' Bharara said . `` For two decades , the Alavi Foundation 's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials , including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations , in violation of a series of American laws . The Alavi Foundation 's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice , and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing . '' John Winter , a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation , said his client would challenge the complaint . `` We 're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter , '' he said in a telephone interview . `` It may take some time , but at the end of this litigation , we 're of the mind that we 're going to prevail here . '' The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual . `` There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants , '' said Yusill Scribner , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement . `` The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today 's filing . '' According to the complaint , the New York tower was built in the 1970s by a nonprofit organization operated by the Shah of Iran to pursue the country 's charitable interests in the United States . Bank Melli financed its construction in prime real estate near Rockefeller Center . In 1979 , after the Iranian revolution , the Islamic Republic of Iran established the Bonyad Mostazafan of New York , since renamed the Alavi Foundation , to take possession of and manage property it had expropriated from the former government , including the Fifth Avenue building . Calls to the Iranian Mission were not immediately returned . The mosques are in New York , Maryland , California and Texas . At the Islamic Institute of New York in Queens , two worshipers said they found out about the move Thursday as they arrived for evening prayers . The front page of the court document stating the terms of the case was tacked to the front door accompanied by a letter from the U.S. Attorney 's office to the Mostazafan Foundation . A senior Justice Department official , trying to blunt any criticism from Muslim groups , told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings , not targeting or `` seizing mosques '' as religious-oriented facilities . The mosques just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question , the official said . But , in a statement , the Council on American-Islamic Relations called the move unprecedented and said it may have First Amendment implications . `` Whatever the details of the government 's case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide , '' said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper . He said the move comes at a bad time , given the community 's fear of a backlash resulting from a Muslim psychiatrist being charged in the deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood in Texas . Relations between Iran and much of the international community have been tense in recent years over Iran 's nuclear ambitions . Iran states that it wants to develop its nuclear program solely for peaceful purposes ; the United States and a number of other countries have said they suspect the oil-rich nation is pursuing a nuclear bomb . In another U.S.-Iran development , President Obama said Thursday in a letter to Congress that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in 1979 during the Iranian revolution has not ended . `` Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal , and the process of implementing the January 19 , 1981 , agreements with Iran is still under way , '' Obama wrote in an official `` notice of continuation '' required to extend the emergency status with Iran beyond the anniversary date of November 14 . `` For these reasons , I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14 , 1979 , with respect to Iran , beyond November 14 , 2009 .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963 . Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . But a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . Last week 's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki , a member of Kenya 's largest Kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe . The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya 's population . Mostly originating from Kenya 's central highlands , the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . Kenya 's first post-independence leader , Jomo Kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a Kikuyu . Kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of Kenyatta 's successor , Daniel Arap Moi , a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe , Kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected . This week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history . But the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . Kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy . However , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . E-mail to a friend","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Penn State students and supporters of head football coach Joe Paterno rallied Tuesday evening outside his home amid growing calls for him to resign related to his response to child sex abuse allegations brought against a former assistant . The crowd in State College , mostly young people , greeted and cheered Paterno hours after his weekly news conference was canceled . Speaking outside and from a window at his residence , the 84-year-old Nittany Lions legend said he was praying for victims in the case . Paterno , a longtime coach with a largely spotless record , is under pressure because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in the shower at the campus football complex . Paterno reported the allegations to his boss , and Pennsylvania 's attorney general said it appeared that the coach had met his obligations under state law . Still , some critics have said that he should have reported the suspected abuse to police . `` We do n't yet know who is legally guilty , '' SI.com columnist Michael Rosenberg wrote on the website . `` But several prominent employees at the state university are morally guilty . And one of them is Joe Paterno . '' On Tuesday , Paterno 's son , Scott Paterno , said on Twitter that reports in the New York Times , citing people briefed on the matter , that university officials were planning an end to Paterno 's 46-year coaching tenure were `` premature . '' `` No discussions about retirement with JVP , '' Paterno said , using his father 's initials . He said the decision to cancel the news conference was not his father 's . `` Due to the ongoing legal circumstances centered around the recent allegations and charges , we have determined that today 's press conference can not be held and will not be rescheduled , '' the university said in a statement . Joe Paterno said Tuesday afternoon that he hopes to hold another news conference soon . `` I know you guys have a lot of good questions , and I 'd like to answer them , but I ca n't do it now , '' Paterno said after practice . A preliminary hearing for Sandusky , originally set for Wednesday , has been rescheduled for December 7 , officials said Tuesday afternoon . Sandusky 's attorney has said more time was needed to bring in witnesses . On Sunday , Penn State announced that two university officials accused by state authorities of failing to report suspected abuse had stepped down , one of them returning to retirement and the other taking administrative leave . Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that the alleged failure of Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley , 57 , and Gary Schultz , 62 , the university 's senior vice president for finance and business , to report abuse claims `` likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many , many years . '' Curley and Schultz , who are each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse , were released Monday on $ 75,000 bail each . At the arraignment hearing , their attorneys said the men were innocent of the charges and would fight to clear their names . Sandusky is accused of sexual offenses , child endangerment and `` corruption of a minor '' charges involving eight boys , most or all of whom he met through the Second Mile , the charity he founded to help troubled youth , according to prosecutors . Sandusky 's involvement with the group provided him with `` access to hundreds of boys , many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations , '' the grand jury said . The former coach is said to have engaged in fondling , oral sex and anal sex with young boys over at least 15 years , according to the investigative grand jury 's summary of testimony . A source with direct knowledge of the investigation confirmed to CNN 's Jason Carroll that a man walked into a Montoursville , Pennsylvania , state police station and claimed he was victimized by Sandusky . Interviews with the man will determine whether he 's a ninth victim , the source said . Sandusky , who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions football team before retiring in 1999 , is free on $ 100,000 bail . His attorney , Joseph Amendola , has not returned a message from CNN seeking comment . Overheard on CNN.com about Joe Paterno The grand jury investigation that led to the charges began with the claims of one alleged victim who said Sandusky had `` indecently assaulted '' him and engaged in sex acts while he was a guest at the coach 's home , according to the attorney general . The victim met Sandusky through the Second Mile , and Sandusky allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games , golf clubs , a computer and money , Kelly said . The relationship , which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008 , included overnight stays at Sandusky 's home , where touching led to sexual acts , according to Kelly and grand jury testimony . However , the most explosive charges in the grand jury report involve a 2002 incident in which a graduate student reported seeing Sandusky in the shower performing anal sex on a young boy , according to the grand jury and prosecutors . `` One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002 , in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus , '' Kelly said . `` Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old . '' The assistant reported the incident to Paterno , who in turn alerted Curley . Paterno said in his statement that he had done his duty in informing Curley . `` It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report . Regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky . As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time , I referred the matter to university administrators , '' Paterno said . But instead of reporting the incident to authorities , Curley and Schultz took Sandusky 's locker room keys and banned him from having children from Second Mile visit the football building , Kelly said . In his statement , Paterno called the charges `` shocking . '' `` While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved , I ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , '' he said in the statement . Prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges or victims in the case . CNN 's Jason Carroll and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Juventus are back on top of the Italian Serie A table after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Palermo on Sunday maintained their unbeaten start to the season . Goals from Simone Pepe , Alessandro Matri and Claudio Marchisio put Juve ahead of Lazio , who drew 0-0 at Napoli on Saturday , on goal difference -- with Antonio Conte 's side also having a vital game in hand . Pepe opened the scoring in the 20th minute when he was left unmarked to head home Giorgio Chiellini 's cross . Andrea Pirlo then hit the post with a curling effort before Matri doubled the advantage three minutes into the second half when finishing from a tight angle . And the points were sealed in the 65th minute when Marchisio netted from close range after a smart dummy from Matri deceived the Palermo defense . Although Juventus are back on top of the table , the race for this year 's Scudetto promises to be the tightest for years with just one point separating the top four teams . Champions AC Milan are third , a point behind the top two , after their goalless draw at Fiorentina on Saturday , while former leaders Udinese are now in fourth place -- level on points with Milan -- after losing 2-0 at Parma . A Jonathan Biabiany header and a Sebastian Giovinco penalty gave Parma a victory that lifted them up to ninth place in the table . Despite their defeat to Juventus , Palermo remain fifth , although they are five points behind Udinese . Meanwhile , at the bottom of the table , Marco Parolo scored seven minutes from time to give Cesena their first win of the season , 1-0 at fellow strugglers Bologna . Despite that win , Cesena remain bottom on six points , one behind Novara who were beaten 1-0 at Genoa . Two matches were played in the German Bundesliga , with Thorsten Fink collecting his first win as Hamburg coach with a 2-0 success at Hoffenheim . Jose Guerrero and Marcel Jansen secured Fink 's maiden success after three successive draws as Hamburg moved out of the relegation zone and into 14th place . The day 's other match saw Austrian striker Martin Harnik score both of Stuttgart 's goals in a 2-1 win over bottom club Augsburg , who are three points adrift at the foot of the table . The victory lifts Stuttgart up to sixth place in the table , seven points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Organization of American States suspended Honduras late Saturday because the nation 's new leaders refused to reinstate ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya . Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly . Zelaya was removed by the military on June 28 and flown to Costa Rica . Congressional leader Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president later that day . The OAS set a Saturday deadline for Honduras to return Zelaya to power or be suspended from the 35-nation hemispheric organization . Honduran officials told OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza on Friday that they would not allow Zelaya to return to power . Thousands of protesters demanding the return to power of ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya pushed through riot police at Tegucigalpa 's airport and surrounded the terminal Saturday , but there were no reports of violence . The airport continued to operate , CNN Correspondent Karl Penhaul reported . Zelaya , a leftist who took office in 2006 , says he will return to Honduras on Sunday . Micheletti has vowed to have Zelaya arrested if he returns . `` I am simply defending a system , '' Zelaya told the OAS delegates early Sunday , after the 33-0 vote to suspend Honduras . Among the delegates were two heads of state : Presidents Christina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay . `` I am here not only as president of the republic of Argentina , but also as part of a delegation who was the object of coups in Argentina , '' Fernandez said . Lugo also spoke in favor of restoring Zelaya and democracy to his nation . `` I come from Paraguay , a country that has had the long night of dictatorships , '' Lugo said . `` I come here with a pain , but also with a hope . '' Micheletti repeated in an interview with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Saturday night that a coup did not take place . What happened , he said , was a constitutional transfer of power authorized by the nation 's congress . But Micheletti is swimming against world opinion . The U.N. General Assembly condemned the coup last week and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated . The European Union and other nations have recalled their ambassadors from Honduras , and the United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid . Honduran officials have said the Central American nation was prepared to withdraw from the OAS rather than reinstate Zelaya . `` If the Organization of American States does n't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States , then Honduras would renounce with immediate effect the inter-American charter , '' said Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado . At the center of the dispute was a referendum Zelaya had vowed to carry out even after the country 's supreme court and congress found it illegal . The nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country 's charter to allow the president to run for re-election . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Zelaya ally , won a similar referendum this year , and many Hondurans thought Zelaya was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in November . Zelaya has denied that was his intent . Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005 , with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio `` Pepe '' Lobo . After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule , Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981 . Since then , the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people , about 70 percent of whom live in poverty . Military interventions were once common in Latin America , but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s . Before Sunday , the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez , when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday , a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman . The 20-term New York Democrat told reporters he had submitted a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting a temporary leave of absence until a broad-reaching House ethics committee investigation concludes . `` In order to avoid my colleagues ' having to defend me during their elections , I have this morning sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking her to grant me a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work , '' Rangel said Wednesday . In a statement , Pelosi said she had accepted Rangel 's request and praised the congressman for `` his decades of leadership on jobs , health care and the most significant economic issues of the day . '' Read Rangel 's letter to Pelosi The night before Rangel said he had no plans to step aside from his powerful post . The Ways and Means Committee is responsible for drafting the nation 's tax policies . Rangel is being investigated for , among other things , failing to pay taxes on a home in the Dominican Republic . The congressman also has admitted failing to report several hundred thousand dollars in assets on federal disclosure forms . In addition , he is under scrutiny for the purported misuse of a rent-controlled apartment for political purposes , as well as for allegedly preserving tax benefits for an oil-drilling company in exchange for donations to a project he supported at the City College of New York . Rangel was formally admonished Friday by the House ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts . Specifically , the committee found that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008 . Rangel 's staff , according to the committee , knew that corporations had given money to the Carib News , which sponsored the events . That fact had not been divulged to the ethics committee when Rangel asked for and received approval to attend the trips , according to the committee 's report . The committee found that while Rangel did not know about the contributions , he was nevertheless responsible . A source told CNN on Tuesday that if Rangel stepped aside , senior Ways and Means Democrat Pete Stark would take over as the committee 's chairman `` on a temporary basis . '' House Republicans plan to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on Rangel to permanently step down and again force House Democrats to go on record defending him . They issued a statement after Rangel 's announcement , calling his decision to temporarily step aside an `` embarrassing episode '' for the Democratic majority . `` Nancy Pelosi 's promise to run the ` most ethical Congress in history ' has been reduced to a punch line , and as a result she is presiding over a caucus in chaos , '' said GOP spokesman Ken Spain . `` The Democrats -- under Speaker Pelosi 's leadership -- are incapable of leading the United States Congress . '' House Democrats have blocked previous GOP resolutions on the House floor , but several Democrats in competitive districts have come out publicly in recent days , saying they thought it was time for Rangel to step down . Rangel is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus , which has 42 members in the House . CNN 's Brianna Keilar and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report","question":""}
{"answer":"RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 12-mile oil slick near where an Air France jet crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean indicates the plane likely did n't break up until it hit the water , Brazil 's defense minister said Wednesday . Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site . If true , that would argue against an in-flight explosion as the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 447 , Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters . But Robert Francis , former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board , said the question of determining where a plane broke up `` is a very difficult one to deal with . '' He told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' that `` there are lots of things that cause a plane to go out of control . '' He added that extremely strong winds are not unusual near Brazil . Pilots who fly over that part of the world keep track of radar and `` are very , very wary about the weather as they go back and forth down in that area . '' Jobim said currents had strewn the debris widely and that the search area had been expanded to 300 square miles . The Airbus A330 , carrying 228 people , went down about three hours after beginning what was to have been an 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris , France . No survivors have been found . Map of Flight AF 447 's flight path '' Investigators have not determined what caused the plane to crash . The flight data recorders have not been recovered , and the plane 's crew did not send any messages indicating problems before the plane disappeared . Watch as high seas hamper recovery '' The Brazilian Air Force said it found the oil slick and four debris fields Wednesday , but rain and rough seas kept searchers from plucking any of the debris from the water . Among Wednesday 's finds were objects in a circular 5-kilometer -LRB- 3-mile -RRB- area , including one object with a diameter of 7 meters -LRB- 23 feet -RRB- and 10 other objects , some of which were metallic , Brazilian Air Force spokesman Jorge Amaral said . Searchers had found two debris fields Tuesday and identified the wreckage as coming from Flight 447 . The debris was found about 650 kilometers -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands , an archipelago 355 kilometers -LRB- 220 miles -RRB- off the northeast coast of Brazil . It included an airplane seat and an orange float . Wednesday 's debris find was about 90 kilometers -LRB- 56 miles -RRB- south of Tuesday 's discoveries , Amaral said . Eleven aircraft and five ships are engaged in the search , including airplanes from France and the United States . Watch as experts question whether recovery is possible '' The NTSB said Wednesday it has accepted an invitation from the French aviation accident investigation authority , the Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses , to aid in the investigation . NTSB Acting Chairman Mark V. Rosenker has designated senior air safety investigator Bill English as the U.S. accredited representative . The U.S. team will include technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration ; General Electric , which made the plane 's engines ; and Honeywell , which made the plane 's data recorders . The aircraft 's computer system did send about four minutes of automated messages indicating a loss of cabin pressure and an electrical failure , officials have said . Some investigators have noted that the plane flew through a severe lightning storm . Foul play has not been ruled out . Air France had received a bomb threat May 27 for a flight from Buenos Aires , Argentina , to Paris , sources in the Argentine military and police told CNN on Wednesday . According to the officials , who had been briefed on the incident and declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation , the Air France office in Buenos Aires received the threat from a man speaking Spanish . Authorities checked the Boeing 777 and did not find anything . Security was tightened during check-in for Flight 415 , which left on time and without incident , the officials said . Although officials have said the likelihood of finding survivors of Flight 447 's crash is small , authorities have not closed the door on the possibility . `` Until the aircraft is identified , and the remains indicate that survival is technically impossible , we will maintain the possibility that there could be survivors , '' Amaral said . The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil , France and Germany . The remaining victims were from 29 other countries , including three passengers from the United States . French officials said Wednesday they may never find the jet 's flight data recorders . The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters -LRB- about 9,840 feet -RRB- to 7,500 meters -LRB- 24,600 feet -RRB- . Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters -LRB- 6,562 to 9,842 feet -RRB- . `` We need time to reach the recorders , '' said Paul-Louis Arslanian , head of France 's accident investigation bureau . The recorders are built to emit locator signals for up to 30 days . The French government has sent a research vessel carrying a deep-diving submersible to where the debris was found . `` Recorders from time to time were found after the 30 days , but I 'm not so optimistic , '' Arslanian said . `` It 's not only deep , it 's also very mountainous at that place of the ocean . '' But Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed optimism that the flight data recorders would be found . `` I think that a country with the ability to retrieve oil from 6,000 meters -LRB- 3.7 miles -RRB- underwater can retrieve a plane from 2,000 meters -LRB- 1.2 miles -RRB- . The truth is , we are going to see -- I 'm not a specialist and do n't want to give predictions of what will happen , '' Lula said , according to the Brazilian state news agency . A memorial for the victims of Flight AF 447 , which included 61 people from France , 58 Brazilians , 26 Germans and people from 29 other countries , took place Wednesday at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of American figure skater Nancy Kerrigan is dead and her brother is behind bars , accused of assault and battery against 70-year old Daniel Kerrigan , according to Massachusetts authorities . Daniel Kerrigan died Sunday after being taken by emergency personnel from his family home in Stoneham , Massachusetts , to a hospital , authorities said . His son Mark , 45 , was arraigned Monday and pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged assault . According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley , police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. Sunday from Brenda Kerrigan , wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan . Keeley told Middlesex District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment Monday for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son , resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor . Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities `` that he did in fact have an argument with his father , the argument became physical , he grabbed his father around the neck , and at some point the father collapsed to the floor . '' The Middlesex District Attorney 's office said Monday that authorities were still investigating the `` entirety of the circumstances of the incident , '' along with the cause and manner of death . The county medical examiner is expected to release a report within a couple of weeks . According to Keeley , police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house , `` clearly intoxicated '' and `` extremely combative . '' He refused to comply with police officers , said Keeley , and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home . Mark Kerrigan wept softly during Monday 's arraignment . His attorney , Denise Moore , told the judge that Kerrigan was in grief and `` quite distraught about his father 's death . '' Through his attorney , Mark Kerrigan denied any responsibility in the death . Moore said in court that Mark Kerrigan was unemployed , was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents . He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress , apparently from his time in the Army , Moore said . Despite appeals from his attorney , Sullivan ordered Kerrigan held on $ 10,000 cash bail . His next court appearance is expected to be February 24 . Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France . In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer , Norway . But she is perhaps best remembered for surviving an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding 's ex-husband and an accomplice . Through a spokeswoman on Tuesday , the Kerrigan family released a statement saying : `` Dan Kerrigan was a wonderful husband for 47 years , a caring and loving father to his daughter Nancy and two sons , Michael and Mark , and a grandfather of eight . ... The family 's focus is on mourning Dan and honoring his life and many contributions . '' CNN 's Vanessa Juarez contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Republican Party that struggled in the wake of recent Democratic landslides sprang back to life Tuesday with wins in hotly contested races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey , according to CNN projections . In Virginia , 55-year-old former state attorney general Bob McDonnell will be the first Republican to win the state 's highest office in twelve years , CNN projects . Republicans will win races for Virginia 's lieutenant governor and attorney general as well . In New Jersey , former federal prosecutor Chris Christie will oust first-term Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine , CNN projects . Christie will be the first Republican to win the top office in heavily Democratic New Jersey in 12 years . Corzine will be the first New Jersey governor to lose a re-election bid since 1993 , when then-Gov . Jim Florio , a Democrat , lost to GOP challenger Christie Todd Whitman . The two gubernatorial contests have been deemed by some analysts as the first major referendum on President Obama 's administration . Republicans leaders , demoralized after landslide defeats in 2006 and 2008 , have been hoping to capitalize on wins in Virginia and New Jersey to help fuel a nationwide Republican resurgence . They were buoyed by a huge swing of independent voters to the Republican column . Democrats sought to minimize the defeats . Since 1989 , it was noted , the party winning the White House has always gone on to lose the gubernatorial races in both states the following year . CNN also projects that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be re-elected to a third term . The billionaire mayor is believed to have spent well over $ 100 million of his own money in his quest for a third term -- shattering the record for personal spending in any American campaign . Democrat Bill Owens has won a vacant U.S. House seat in upstate New York , CNN projects . The contest to fill the seat sparked a vicious internal fight between GOP conservatives and moderates . The struggle has been viewed as a proxy for a national struggle between activists arguing the GOP slipped by betraying conservative values and officials warning a rightward move would further alienate an increasingly independent-minded electorate . The split could result in the election of a new Democratic congressman from a region that has backed Republican congressional candidates since 1872 . Voters in nearby Maine -- not generally noted for their hard-edged , ideological politics -- tackled an emotional hot-button issue as voters decided whether to overturn a recently enacted law legalizing same-sex marriage . Results on the measure were not immediately expected , however . Washington state voters are choosing whether to uphold a law granting same-sex domestic partners the same rights as heterosexual married couples . Results on either measure were not immediately available , however . The fight for control of New York 's City Hall is one of 380 mayoral races across the country , including contests in Atlanta , Georgia ; Boston , Massachusetts ; Detroit , Michigan ; Houston , Texas ; and Seattle , Washington . It was the two races for governor , however , that appeared to attract the most interest at the White House . Obama personally campaigned for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in both states . A plurality of voters in both states cited the economy as their top concern , according to exit polls . Majorities in both states said Obama 's job performance was not a factor in their vote . In Virginia , McDonnell beat Democratic nominee Creigh Deeds , a state senator from the rural western part of the state , by 21 points among critical independent voters . Last year , in contrast , Obama edged out GOP presidential nominee John McCain by one point among Virginia independents . African-Americans , as expected , voted overwhelmingly for the 51-year-old Deeds . Their total share of the vote , however , dropped from 20 percent from last year -- when Obama topped the ballot -- to 16 percent . McDonnell benefited from a Virginia electorate that , according to the exit poll , was slightly more conservative Tuesday than it was in 2008 . Conservatives were also more unified in their support for McDonnell than they were for former GOP presidential nominee John McCain . McDonnell himself is a staunch conservative , but stressed bipartisan solutions to problems relating to job growth and transportation . Deeds sought to peel social moderates and political independents away from McDonnell in part by highlighting McDonnell 's graduate school thesis , in which the Republican was critical of homosexuals and women in the workplace . The attacks appeared to backfire on Deeds . Almost two of every three voters said Deeds attacked McDonnell unfairly ; those voters broke for McDonnell by a 21-point margin . McDonnell 's expected victory is in keeping with Virginia 's tradition of backing candidates from the party that most recently lost the White House . Republican George Allen was elected in 1993 , one year after Bill Clinton won the presidency . Democrat Mark Warner won in 2001 , a year after George W. Bush 's first presidential victory . In 2008 , Obama became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry an increasingly diverse Virginia in more than four decades . Fewer than one in five voters on Tuesday , however , said their vote was meant to express support for the president . Almost one in four said their vote was meant to express opposition to Obama . Further north in New Jersey , Corzine had pulled even in the final surveys before Election Day with the help of a virtual 2-to-1 spending advantage . Many analysts believed independent candidate Chris Daggett , a socially moderate former Republican , was also be digging into Christie 's support . Obama , who carried New Jersey by almost 16 points in 2008 , campaigned for Corzine three times , most recently this past Sunday . The president 's help , however , was not enough to save Corzine , who was saddled with burden of seeking reelection in the midst of a steep economic downturn . Almost one-third of New Jersey voters cited the economy as their top concern in early exit polls , with another 25 percent citing the state 's high property taxes . One in five voters said their top concern was the state 's ongoing struggle with corruption . Independent voters broke even more heavily for Christie in New Jersey than for McDonnell in Virginia . Corzine was able to keep the race close , however , due to New Jersey 's political landscape . New Jersey voters were both more Democratic and more liberal than Virginia voters . Last year , the president also managed to carry New York 's sprawling 23rd congressional district , a traditional GOP stronghold running along the Canadian border from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario . The area has sent Republican representatives to Congress since Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant occupied the White House . But this year it was the scene of a GOP civil war . The district 's U.S. House seat opened up a few months ago after nine-term Republican Rep. John McHugh stepped down to become secretary of the Army . Local Republican leaders picked state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava as their nominee to replace McHugh because they felt her moderate views would appeal to centrist Republicans , independents and even some Democrats . The decision , however , sparked a revolt among conservatives angry with what they saw as Scozzafava 's liberal views on same-sex marriage , abortion and fiscal matters such as the president 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan . They backed Doug Hoffman , an accountant , ran on the state 's Conservative Party line . Scozzafava suspended her campaign Saturday after her poll numbers plummeted following a flood of support and contributions to Hoffman from leading conservative politicians and organizations . Republican leaders were fractured by the choice . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed Scozzafava . Gingrich 's one-time deputy , former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , backed Hoffman . After dropping out , Scozzafava endorsed Democratic nominee Bill Owens . She campaigned for him on Monday . CNN 's Peter Hamby and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama claimed the second major legislative victory of his young administration Wednesday , signing a bill to provide federally funded health care to an estimated 4 million children . President Obama says the SCHIP bill is a downpayment on his `` commitment to cover every single American . '' The final version of the new law , which expands the State Children 's Health Insurance Program -LRB- SCHIP -RRB- by roughly $ 35 billion over the next five years , passed a sharply polarized House of Representatives earlier in the day , with almost every Democrat voting in favor of the expansion and most Republicans opposing it . With the bill , Obama said at a White House ceremony , `` We fulfill one of the highest responsibilities that we have -- to ensure the health and well-being of our nation 's children . '' The president said the bill was a downpayment on his `` commitment to cover every single American . '' The SCHIP expansion is Obama 's second major legislative win in less than a week . The first was Thursday 's approval of the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act , which makes it easier to sue employers for wage-based discrimination . Learn more about the SCHIP program '' The expansion is also a sign of the strength of Washington 's new Democratic majority . Former President George W. Bush vetoed two similar health care bills in 2007 , arguing that the legislation would encourage families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . Before the bill 's passage , SCHIP covered almost 7 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who ca n't afford private insurance . The new law boosts total SCHIP funding to approximately $ 60 billion . The expanded program will be financed with a 62-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . `` This is a day worthy of celebration . There can be no greater cause ... than protecting the well-being of our nation 's children , '' New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone , the legislation 's primary House author , said shortly before the bill 's final passage on a 290-135 vote . Passing the health program 's expansion is `` morally the right thing to do by our children , '' said freshman Rep. Tom Perriello , D-Virginia . `` At a time when the cost of health care is crushing America 's families ... this is an important lifeline . '' Opponents of the legislation argued that , among other things , it will allow undocumented immigrants to illegally access taxpayer-financed health care , and is insufficiently funded . `` This will go out of control just like all the other -LSB- entitlement -RSB- programs have , and our children will pay , '' Rep. Jack Linder , R-Georgia , warned during the House debate Wednesday . Rep. Steve King , R-Iowa , ripped the bill as a `` foundation stone for socialized medicine in the United States , '' arguing that raising the income limit for SCHIP eligibility will serve as the basis for a massive expansion of government-run health care . The Senate passed the expansion Friday in a 66-32 vote . All those voting against the bill were Republicans , though nine Republicans voted in favor of the measure .","question":""}
{"answer":"ROCKVILLE , Maryland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced it is blocking the import from China of five species of seafood until their importers can prove they are not contaminated . About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the U.S. comes from China , according to the National Fisheries Institute . `` FDA is initiating an import alert against several species of imported Chinese farmed seafood because of numerous cases of contamination with drugs and unsafe food additives , '' said Dr. David Acheson , the agency 's assistant commissioner for food protection , in a conference call with reporters . The species cited are catfish , eel , shrimp , basa and dace , he said . Basa is similar to catfish ; dace is similar to carp . The medications cited include the antimicrobials nitrofuran , malachite green , gentian violet and fluoroquinolones . Nitrofuran , malachite green , and gentian violet have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals . Use of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals can result in antibiotic resistance . None of them is approved for use in farmed seafood in the United States and some of them have been shown to cause cancer when fed to laboratory animals for `` prolonged periods of time , '' Acheson said . Alerts have been issued in the past , but Thursday 's announcement is the largest . The food will not be allowed into the United States until the importer can prove it is free from harmful contaminants , Acheson said . He said the agency decided to broaden its previous alerts for products from individual companies to a countrywide alert after tests showed that 15 percent of those species of seafood produced by 18 companies in China contained traces of one or more of the contaminants . `` FDA is taking this action to protect the public health of the American people , '' he said . Watch more on the FDA 's import alert on five kinds of fish from China . '' The products `` could cause serious health problems if consumed over a long period of time , '' he said . Still , Acheson added , the low levels of contaminants means that there is `` no imminent threat '' to the public health . China is the world 's largest producer of farmed fish , accounting for 70 percent of the total produced , he said . It is the third-largest exporter of farmed fish to the United States . The action is an import alert , which means that these products from Chinese processors `` will be detained and refused entry into the United States until the importer can demonstrate that the product is safe and in compliance with applicable regulations , '' said Margaret O ' K. Glavin , FDA 's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs . Last year , the FDA slapped a countrywide alert on all Chinese eel after tests showed residues of an antimicrobial agent , she said . Since then , and `` despite extensive communications between FDA and appropriate Chinese authorities to correct the problem , we have continued to find residues of certain veterinary drugs or food additives that are not permitted for use in the United States , '' she added . Glavin said the FDA inspects 5 percent of seafood from China . The first alert on Chinese seafood occurred before 2001 , she said . `` We 're not asking for this product to be withdrawn from the market or for people to take this out of their freezers and throw it away , '' Acheson said . `` This is a long-term health concern ; it is not an acute health concern . '' China is not the sole offender , Glavin said . Import alerts have been ordered for firms in the Philippines , Mexico `` and several others , '' though this is the first countrywide import alert , she said . More than 80 percent of shrimp eaten in the United States is imported , including 7 percent from China , according to the National Fisheries Institute . About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the United States comes from China , the seafood industry advocacy group said . Last year , the United States imported 590,299 metric tons of shrimp from abroad ; 68,150 metric tons of which came from China , according to the Department of Commerce . The United States imported $ 1.2 billion of fish from China in 2004 , according to H. M. Johson & Associates , a seafood industry research group . E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The oldest-known hominid skeleton was a 4-foot-tall female who walked upright more than 4 million years ago and offers new clues to how humans may have evolved , scientists say . This sketch shows what a 4 million-year-old hominid , nicknamed Ardi , may have looked like . Scientists believe that the fossilized remains , which were discovered in 1994 in Ethiopia and studied for years by an international team of researchers , support beliefs that humans and chimpanzees evolved separately from a common ancestor . `` This is not an ordinary fossil . It 's not a chimp . It 's not a human . It shows us what we used to be , '' said project co-director Tim White , a paleontologist at the University of California , Berkeley . Ardipithecus ramidus , nicknamed `` Ardi , '' is a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now Aramis , Ethiopia . That makes Ardi more than a million years older than the celebrated Lucy , the partial ape-human skeleton found in Africa in 1974 . Ardi 's 125-piece skeleton includes the skull , teeth , pelvis , hands and feet bones . Scientists say the data collected from Ardi 's bone fragments over the past 17 years push back the story of human evolution further than previously believed . `` In fact , what Ardipithecus tells us is that we as humans have been evolving to what we are today for at least 6 million years , '' C. Owen Lovejoy , an evolutionary biologist at Kent State University and project anatomist , said Thursday . Analysis of Ardi 's skeleton reveals that she weighed about 110 pounds , had very long arms and fingers , and possessed an opposable big toe that would have helped her grasp branches while moving through trees . Ardi 's brain was believed to be the size of a chimp 's , but she also had many human-like features , such as the ability to walk upright on two legs . Her `` all-purpose type '' teeth indicate that she probably ate a combination of plants , fruits and small mammals , scientists say . `` The anatomy behind this behavioral combination is very unexpected and is certain to cause considerable rethinking of not only our evolutionary past , but also that of our living relatives : the great apes , '' said Alan Walker , professor of biological anthropology at Pennsylvania State University . Many scientists hypothesize that humans took a different evolutionary trajectory from those of chimpanzees , bonobos and gorillas . Ardi 's findings help challenge earlier beliefs that humans evolved from chimpanzees , their closest genetic relatives , scientists say . Researchers are still trying to pinpoint when the two lineages -- chimps and humans -- split from their common ancestor . Digging up the past has not been easy . Scientists stumbled upon the Ardipithecus fossil in 1994 when a graduate student found a single upper molar tooth . The rest of Ardi 's fossilized bones , sandwiched between layers of volcanic rock , took three years to be recovered and many more to be analyzed . `` In many ways , the discovery of Ardipithecus has been like a marathon , '' White said . `` Ardipithecus ramidus and its prevailing anatomy revolutionize the way most of us understood the earlier part of our evolutionary history , '' said team member Yohannes Haile-Selassie , paleontologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History . The Ardi findings are the work of 47 paleontologists and geologists representing 10 countries . The results will be published Friday in 11 articles in a special edition of the journal Science . Until now , Australopithecus , nicknamed `` Lucy , '' was the oldest fossil studied by scientists seeking to explain human evolution . Lucy is believed to have lived about 3.2 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia . Many scientists credit Ethiopia with taking the lead in helping the world better understand the origins of humans . `` This finding points to a deeper sense of our -LSB- humans ' -RSB- interconnectedness , '' Samuel Assefa , Ethiopian ambassador to the United States , said Thursday . `` We are all Ethiopians at heart . '' Ardi 's skeleton resides in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Floyd Mayweather Jr will have to pay Juan Manuel Marquez a reported $ 600,000 after weighing in two pounds too heavy ahead of Saturday night 's welterweight showdown in Las Vegas . Floyd Mayweather Jr , left , faces off with Juan Manuel Marquez ahead of Saturday night 's fight . Fight promoters Golden Boy confirmed after Friday 's weigh-in that there had been a contractually agreed weight of 144 pounds for Mayweather 's comeback bout , and that the American would pay a stipulated -- but undisclosed -- amount for every pound over that amount . As it was , Mayweather tipped the scales at 146 pounds and Mexican Marquez , whose usual weight is around 135 pounds , was weighed at 142 as he stepped up from lightweight for the fight . The maximum for a welterweight is 147 pounds . `` The fight was contracted as a welterweight fight with an agreed upon weight of 144 pounds . However , there were pre-negotiated weight penalties built in , '' Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer told ESPN.com . The website also reported sources who stated that each extra pound would cost Mayweather $ 300,000 , thus giving Marquez an additional $ 600,000 on top of his $ 3.2 million guarantee for the fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . The 32-year-old Mayweather , who returns to the boxing ring for the first time since December 2007 when he beat Ricky Hatton to retain his WBC world welterweight championship , has a reported minimum guarantee of $ 10 million before pay-per-view TV revenues are added . Mayweather is undefeated with a career record of 39-0 , while the 36-year-old Marquez , who holds the WBA and WBO world lightweight belts , has 50 victories from 55 fights , 37 by knockout . Meanwhile , Nikolai Valuev will defend his WBA heavyweight title against British boxer David Haye in Germany on November 7 . The fight , originally announced in July , had been in doubt as American John Ruiz lodged a legal challenge claiming that he was the giant Russian 's mandatory challenger . However , the 36-year-old 's promoters have clinched a deal with Ruiz , meaning the bout can go ahead as planned at Nuremberg 's Arena Nurnberger Versicherung , where Valuev beat Sergei Liakhovich in February 2008 . The 7 ' 1 '' Valuev , the tallest and heaviest boxing champion of all time who has a record of 50 wins from 52 fights , will dwarf the 6 ' 3 '' Haye , the former undisputed cruiserweight champion .","question":""}
{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death of a British soldier on an explosives-clearing operation in Afghanistan has pushed the British death toll there past that of the 1982 Falklands War , the Ministry of Defence announced Tuesday . The soldier 's death brings to 256 the number of British troops killed in Afghanistan since operations there began in 2001 , the defense ministry said . The British death toll from the Falklands conflict was 255 . The soldier , from the 36 Engineer Regiment , died Monday from an explosion in the Nad-e-Ali district of Afghanistan 's southern Helmand Province . He was part of a task force to clear roadside bombs . `` He was leading a team conducting route-clearance operations at the time , making the way ahead safe for others to follow , '' said Lieutenant Colonel David Wakefield , a spokesman for Task Force Helmand . `` His indomitable courage and fortitude , the hallmark of his profession , will not be forgotten . '' The Ministry of Defence did not release his name , but said his next of kin had been informed . Two soldiers from The Royal Scots Borderers , 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland , were killed by an explosion Monday , also in Helmand Province , the defense ministry said . The deaths of those soldiers , whose names were not released , meant the total death toll matched that of the Falklands . `` Sad milestones such as this naturally attract attention in the UK , but in theater our people continue resolutely and courageously with the task of assisting Afghans to build their own future , '' said Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup , chief of the British Defense Staff . `` We should not forget that each and every death of a member of our armed forces is a tragedy of equal proportion , '' British Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth said . `` Our thoughts at this time lie firmly with the families and friends of all the brave men and women fallen in Afghanistan , and we should all remember that every one of them has given their lives in defense of their -- and our -- country .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Described as the largest single gathering of displaced residents in the world today , tens of thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu , according to the United Nations . Members of the U.S. Navy take a young Somali boy to safety after rescuing him and 51 others adrift in a skiff . Fighting between government forces and Islamist militias has triggered the flight of more than 67,000 Somalis in and around Mogadishu since May 8 , the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday . Most of them are heading to the Afgooye corridor , a 30-kilometer -LRB- 19-mile -RRB- stretch of ramshackle housing described by the United Nations ' World Food Program as `` a nightmare . '' The corridor between Mogadishu and the town of Afgooye is already home to 400,000 displaced Somalis , some of them living in huts made of twigs and branches . The clinics are already overwhelmed with malnourished and sick children . This week , Somalia 's transitional president , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , asked the international community `` to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country . '' Ahmed told local journalists Monday that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan , where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups . The fighting has cut supplies of `` desperately needed humanitarian aid '' to the displaced Somalis near the capital city , according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . `` We are starting today the distribution of aid for some 50,000 people in Afgooye corridor through our local partners in Somalia , '' the refugee office said Tuesday . `` Today 's distribution will include cooking sets , plastic sheeting , blankets and mats . '' The number of Somali refugees fleeing to nearby countries also continues to rise , with some 500,000 already in Kenya , Ethiopia , Uganda , Djibouti , Eritrea and Tanzania . Many Somalis have also made the dangerous journey across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen . On Saturday , a U.S. guided missile destroyer rescued a group of 52 Somali men women and children -- including a woman who was eight months pregnant -- who had been stranded aboard a small skiff for nearly a week off Somalia 's coast , the U.S. Navy said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government 's ongoing crackdown on dissidents , the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . Among the dead was a 12-year-old boy shot to death when Syrian security forces fired on a funeral procession , according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . . The funeral procession was for a protester killed Sunday , the observatory said . In addition , 17 people were killed during operations by the military and security forces in Hama as authorities searched for wanted activists and demonstrators , the organization said . Meanwhile , an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said parliamentary elections could be held in the country by the end of the year , Russian media reported earlier Monday . Bouthaina Shaaban , the political and media adviser to al-Assad , was in Moscow on Monday to speak to journalists on the situation in Syria . `` I can tentatively say that such elections may be held either at the end of this year or the beginning of next , '' Shaaban said , according to the RIA-Novosti news agency . The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600 , the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday . The U.S. State Department , meanwhile , is condemning the killing of a key Syrian opposition organizer who it says died while in the custody of Syria 's security forces . Ghiyath Mattar , described as a key organizer of protests against al-Assad 's regime , was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Damascus suburb of Darya , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement released Sunday . `` His brave commitment to confronting the regime 's despicable violence with peaceful protest serves as an example for the Syrian people and for all those who suffer under the yoke of oppression , '' the statement said Mattar was arrested along with leading opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and a number of other activists , Nuland said . Mattar was `` a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent , '' said one of Mattar 's friends . `` His death is an attack by the regime on peace . His attack is saying , ` We want to destroy the messengers of peace in Syria and the ideals and values they hold . '' `` His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader , '' said another man , a colleague of Mattar 's . `` Everyone loved him and he had so many close friends and relatives . '' Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution . On September 6 , Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji 's brother saying he was injured and needed help , according to the friend . In reality , security forces had forced the brother to call Sharbaji . The operation led to the arrests , the friend said . Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months , as protesters demanding more freedom , democratic elections and an end to al-Assad 's regime have been met by brute force . The government has maintained a consistent narrative : It is going after armed terrorists . But opposition activists say the regime is behind a systematic , sustained slaughter . Mattar , 26 , was on the run for three months before being taken into custody , according to the Syrian Observatory . The group , citing reports from Mattar 's fellow opposition members , said he was tortured to death . Syria 's crackdown on protesters has been roundly condemned by many world leaders and the United Nations . The Arab League has publicly called for al-Assad 's regime to show restraint and end the violence . The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria , freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country . The European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and imposed a travel ban . Navi Pillay , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , put the number killed in the unrest at 2,600 , citing `` reliable sources on the ground , '' in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday during the commission 's session . The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March . In her statement , Nuland repeated calls by the United States for al-Assad to step down . `` We call on the -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- regime to immediately cease all violence against the Syrian people and release all political prisoners . We again call on -LRB- al-Assad -RRB- to step aside and allow the Syrian people to embark upon the democratic transformation they demand , '' she said the in the statement . A video posted on YouTube purportedly showing the funeral of Mattar in Darya showed people marching in the street and chanting : `` We will sacrifice our lives and our blood for you , Ghiyath '' and `` Freedom , freedom , we are the youths of freedom . '' Mattar 's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners , and that one man was shot and later died . CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the video , the claims or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The FBI attained `` actionable intelligence '' from bombing suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab in the first hours after his arrest on Christmas Day , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday . `` AbdulMutallab spent a number of hours with FBI investigators in which we gleaned useable , actionable intelligence , '' Gibbs told reporters . According to authorities , Nigerian-born AbdulMutallab tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , made its final approach to Detroit , Michigan , December 25 . The device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at the man 's seat . Gibbs declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence . AbdulMutallab , 23 , has been tied to the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . In a statement to reporters after meeting with his national security team , President Obama said U.S. officials had enough information in their possession before the failed bombing attack to have prevented the suspect from getting on the plane , but had been unable to `` connect the dots . '' Obama said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work , `` but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged , '' he said , adding : `` That 's not acceptable , and I will not tolerate it . '' `` Time and again we 've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary , '' Obama said . `` So we have to do better , and we will do better , and we have to do it quickly . American lives are on the line . '' In one step , senior State Department officials told CNN on Tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from U.S.-bound flights . Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material , the officials said the United States has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no-fly list or revoke their visas . If the new criteria had been in place before Christmas , AbdulMutallab would have been added to the no-fly list , the officials said . AbdulMutallab is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Milan , Michigan , where he 's still being treated for the burn injuries he received in the failed bombing . He faces charges of attempting to destroy an aircraft , and will face his first court hearings Friday . The suspect apparently arrived in Amsterdam already carrying the explosives he planned to use , Dutch prosecutors said Tuesday . `` The suspect traveled through Ghana before he arrived via Lagos -LSB- Nigeria -RSB- at Schiphol , '' prosecutors said , referring to the airport where AbdulMutallab boarded the flight to Detroit . `` So far , it seems he already had the explosives with him before he landed at Schiphol . '' Also Tuesday , British officials announced that London 's Heathrow Airport will introduce more body scanners within weeks , and that all British airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year . British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the British government had no evidence AbdulMutallab had been planning an attack . Johnson added that British authorities were directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors can not spot explosives without metal parts . Last week , Obama blamed human error and security lapses for the failure by officials to act on information that AbdulMutallab was a possible terrorist threat . He had a valid multiple-entry U.S. visa . His father , a leading banker in Nigeria , had warned U.S. authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with Islamic extremists , but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa . Tuesday 's White House meetings were held just hours after the United States reopened its embassy in Yemen . It 's believed that AbdulMutallab may have received training in Yemen from the group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . The United States ' decision to close the embassy came after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives could have been planning an attack on the compound , a senior administration official said Monday . A statement posted on the Embassy 's Web site said `` successful counter-terrorism operations '' conducted by Yemeni security forces Monday north of the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , addressed `` a specific area of concern and have contributed to the Embassy 's decision to resume operations . '' Yemen 's state-run news agency , SABA , reported Monday that two al Qaeda suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a Yemeni anti-terrorism unit .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World number four Andy Murray continued his superb end of season form , coming back from a set down to beat top seed and defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final of the Japan Open in Tokyo on Sunday . Murray won last week 's Thailand Open , as well as last month 's Cincinnati Masters , but he looked to be on course for a sixth successive loss against world number two Nadal when the Spaniard powered through the opening set . But Murray turned things around in devastating style , taking the second set and then outplaying 10-times major champion Nadal in the decider , allowing his opponent just four points in the whole set , to complete an impressive 3-6 6-2 6-0 success . It was Murray 's 21st win from his last 22 matches , his only defeat in that time coming to Nadal in the semifinals of the U.S. Open , and ensured he closed the gap to third-ranked Roger Federer ahead of next week 's Shanghai Masters tournament in China . Murray told the official ATP Tour website : `` I 've played well in the last few months in Cincinnati and then the U.S. Open and I now need to carry on that form into Shanghai . `` I need to keep up the wins and hopefully I 'll get to the No. 3 ranking . It 's not the ultimate goal , but it 's the target I set myself for the last few tournaments of the year . '' He added : `` It had to be some of the best tennis I have ever played in the third set . I 've played some good matches against Rafa in the past but it was just very consistent . I did n't make too many mistakes and played well at important moments , '' he added . Nadal , who is again seeded to meet Murray in the final in Shanghai , conceded that his opponent was too strong for him on the day . `` Andy 's serve worked fantastic at important moments . He played unbelievable and made no mistakes in the third set when he played very aggressive and hit a lot of winners . '' Meanwhile , Czech Tomas Berdych claimed his first ATP Tour title in nearly two-and-a-half years with a 3-6 6-4 6-1 success over Croat Marin Cilic in the final of the China Open in Beijing . Third seed Berdych was securing his sixth career title but his first since winning on the clay courts of Munich in May 2009 . In the women 's final , 11th seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland overcame a second set hiccup to defeat Andrea Petkovic of Germany , seeded nine , 7-5 0-6 6-4 to claim her seventh career title .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is giving General Motors 60 days worth of financing for restructuring , according to senior administration officials . General Motors ' Rick Wagoner , CEO of the company since 2000 , is on his way out , sources say . Chrysler will receive as much as $ 6 billion and 30 days to complete an agreement with Italian automaker Fiat , the officials said . Meanwhile , White House and GM sources told CNN Sunday that GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner will resign as part of the federal government 's bailout strategy for the troubled automaker . Wagoner 's departure comes as President Obama is expected to announce Monday the latest details of the government 's plans for restructuring GM and Chrysler LLC , which have been pushed to the brink by huge losses and a sharp decline in sales . Fritz Henderson , GM 's chief operating officer , is expected to be named GM 's interim CEO , according to two GM sources . A GM spokesman declined to comment on reports of Wagoner 's resignation . A company statement said : `` We are anticipating an announcement soon from the administration regarding the restructuring of the U.S. auto industry . '' GM and Chrysler face a Tuesday deadline to prove to the Treasury Department that they can be viable in the long term . Without such a finding , the government can recall the $ 13.4 billion it already loaned to GM and the $ 4 billion it loaned to Chrysler . Wagoner , a 32-year company veteran , has been CEO of General Motors since 2000 . Before becoming CEO , he was chief operating officer and led the company 's North American operations . He also served as chief financial officer from 1992 to 1994 . A senior GM official official told CNN that the White House and its auto task force had `` sent very clear signals '' that the key to more help was `` new leadership '' and something that would help the administration see real change . General Motors has been hit hard as auto sales have plummeted . Sales have continued to tumble through the early months of this year , falling 40 percent across the industry and about 50 percent at GM and Chrysler . The companies and industry analysts have slashed their sales estimates for the year , and that has heightened the need for more loans to keep GM and Chrysler afloat . Last month , the two companies filed reports on their restructuring efforts . GM said it needed up to $ 16.6 billion more in loans . Chrysler asked for an additional $ 5 billion , and said it would need the money by the end of March to avoid running out of cash . The Obama administration had been widely expected to approve the requests . Obama has repeatedly spoken about the importance of saving the struggling auto industry , and on March 19 , the Treasury Department announced $ 5 billion in federal help for GM 's and Chrysler 's auto parts suppliers .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of a retired FBI agent who was reported missing in Iran two years ago said Monday that they remain hopeful for his return . Photos from Robert Levinson 's family show him in 2006 , left , and as he might look today . Monday marks the second anniversary of the disappearance of Robert Levinson , a father of seven children and grandfather of two . `` After two years of constantly praying for his return , we continue to anxiously await word of his whereabouts , '' said Christine Levinson , the missing man 's wife , in a statement . `` Two years -LSB- have passed -RSB- since our seven children and I last heard his voice , saw his warm , loving smile , and since we last hugged him hello or kissed him goodbye , '' she said . Tuesday will be Levinson 's 61st birthday . Levinson disappeared during a business trip to Iran 's Kish Island in 2007 . Iranian authorities have said repeatedly that they do not know what might have happened to him , but the claim is widely doubted in the United States . `` Since that day our family has been living a nightmare , '' Christine Levinson said . `` This has brought so much darkness to our lives . '' Christine Levinson released a computer-enhanced photograph showing what the family thinks Bob Levinson may look like today . The State Department has consistently denied Levinson was working for the U.S. government and has unsuccessfully pressed Tehran for information about his whereabouts . `` We reiterate our commitment to determining Mr. Levinson 's welfare and whereabouts , and reuniting him with his family , '' acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement on Sunday . Congressional reaction in Levinson 's home state of Florida has been more pointed . `` On several diplomatic occasions when Bob Levinson 's name has been brought up to Iranian officials , the standard answer is , ` We do n't know anything about that . ' But the next thing out of the Iranian officials ' mouths are to discuss the matter of the Iranians held by the Americans in Irbil , Iraq , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , told reporters last month . `` You can draw your own conclusions , '' he said . U.S. troops arrested five Iranians accused of being members of an elite Iranian military unit during a January 2007 raid in the Iraqi city of Irbil . The Iranians were accused of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq , but Iran said they were diplomats and accused the United States of violating international law by raiding a consulate . Nelson and Rep. Robert Wexler , D-Florida , have said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective chambers calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson . Levinson had been working as a private investigator in Dubai . He was last heard from on March 8 , 2007 , when he checked into a Kish Island hotel and then checked out to return to the United States the following day . Wexler has said Levinson never arrived at the airport for his flight home . In December 2007 , Levinson 's wife and other relatives traveled to Iran and met with officials . Christine Levinson has said the Iranian government was polite and guaranteed her family 's security on their trip , but provided no details regarding her husband 's whereabouts . `` In the past two years , our family 's grief has grown to despair , '' Christine Levinson said . The State Department is asking anyone with information about the case to contact the department or the Levinson family via their Web site , www.helpboblevinson.com .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela toiled for 27 years in South African prisons before gaining his freedom and leading his nation from white minority rule to full democracy . In the process , he became an international symbol of strength and hope . Mandela became South Africa 's first black president in 1984 . This month he celebrates his 90th birthday with a lavish , star-studded concert in London that confirms his enduring status as a revered global icon . But his journey from young protester to political prisoner to leader of his nation has not been without heartache and personal loss . Mandela was born in 1918 in the South African village Qunu . He was the son of the chief councilor to a Thembu chief , and he soon became passionate about political reformation , founding the African National Congress Youth League in 1944 with lifelong friend Oliver Tambo . Mandela 's natural leadership skills pushed him front and center during the ANC 's 1952 Defiance Campaign , which urged South African citizens not to cooperate with certain laws deemed discriminatory . Mandela urged nonviolent solutions to the South African government 's political , economic and social oppression of the nation 's black majority . His commitment to nonviolent change was tested , however , in March of 1960 when black protestors in the township of Sharpeville were fired upon by South African police as they gathered to protest a law that required all black citizens to carry passbooks at all times . Sixty-nine people were killed and more than 180 were injured in the clash . The Sharpeville Massacre sparked riots , strikes and protest demonstrations across South Africa , and the government declared a state of emergency . But the massacre also highlighted the tragedy of apartheid to the rest of the world . The United Nations condemned the massacre , and its security council convened on April 1 , 1960 , to consider the ravaging effects of apartheid on South Africa 's people . Inside the country , Mandela and his colleagues reconsidered the use of violence to further their cause for freedom . Mandela formed the revolutionary group Spear of the Nation In 1961 and was named its commander in chief . He slipped out of South Africa for military training in Algeria in 1962 but was arrested soon after he returned . See pictures of Mandela 's life '' Mandela had several previous run-ins with police , and he was eventually sentenced to life in prison for his actions protesting South Africa 's apartheid government . At the time of his sentence Mandela made a dramatic statement that illustrated his overarching commitment to freedom : `` During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to the struggle of the African people , '' he said . `` I have fought against white domination , and I have fought against black domination . I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities . It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve . But , if needs be , it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die . '' Listen to famous speech '' During his long incarceration , Mandela nearly became a myth . He smuggled out notes of encouragement to his followers that read like pronouncements . `` Any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose , '' one note said . He might have been condemned to hard labor in a limestone quarry , but Mandela 's unyielding moral stance held him high on a pedestal to his followers . In 1990 , it became clear to then-South African President F.W. de Klerk that Mandela 's release was necessary for the nation to heal . Mandela was 71 years old when he walked free from Victor Verster prison , his clenched fist held high . He 'd lived a life of protest for a cause for which he 'd been prepared to die . And now he would lead a nation on the brink of civil war to democracy . Three years later , de Klerk and Mandela would share the Nobel Peace Prize . `` The policy of reconciliation that Nelson R. Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk represent provides hope not only for South Africa ; it is also a shining example for the world that there are ways out of the vicious circle of violence and bitterness , '' said Francis Sejersted , chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee as he awarded the shared prize . In 1994 , Mandela was elected president in South Africa 's first all-race general elections . Since his retirement in 1999 , Mandela has turned his attention to international diplomacy : He convinced Libya to hand over two suspects for trial in the Lockerbie airplane bombing , and he played a role in the Burundi peace process . In 2005 , he took up a personal cause closer to home . Mandela 's son , Makgatho Mandela , 54 , died of an AIDS-related illness . Nearly 5 million South Africans may have AIDS , medical experts estimate , and for many in the country discussing the disease is a taboo . `` Let us give publicity to HIV\/AIDS and not hide it , because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB , like cancer , is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV\/AIDS , '' Mandela said in January at a news conference where he announced his loss . `` And people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary . '' On Mandela 's 80th birthday he wed his 52-year-old companion , Graca Machel , from Mozambique at a private ceremony in his home in Johannesburg , South Africa . He danced at the double celebration surrounded by his grandchildren , family and close friends .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A North Carolina man charged with killing a pregnant Fort Bragg soldier was the father of her unborn child , authorities said Wednesday . Sgt. Edgar Patino faces first-degree murder charges in the slaying of Megan Touma . Army Sgt. Edgar Patino is linked to two anonymous `` confession '' letters sent in what police believe was an attempt to derail the investigation into Megan Touma 's death , police said . Patino , 27 , was arrested at his Hope Mills , North Carolina , home Tuesday night without incident . Patino , who is stationed at Fort Bragg 's JFK Special Warfare Training Center , faces first-degree murder charges in the slaying of Touma , 23 , who was seven months pregnant . Touma 's decomposing body was found in the bathtub of a hotel room near Fort Bragg on June 21 . Authorities said Wednesday that they believe she died late June 13 or early June 14 . Although her death has been ruled a homicide , authorities said Wednesday that the state medical examiner has not made a final determination of how she died . Watch officials discuss the case '' Patino has admitted being in Touma 's hotel room June 13 , and investigators found that the room 's electronic key card was last used on that day , police said Wednesday . However , Patino has not admitted killing Touma . Patino wore red jail coveralls in his initial court appearance Wednesday afternoon . He spoke only to answer the judge 's questions , acknowledging that he understood he was charged with first-degree murder and that the charge carries a maximum penalty of death or life in prison without parole . He also requested that an attorney be appointed for him . Fayetteville , North Carolina , police Chief Tom Bergamine said Wednesday that Patino , who is married , was the father of Touma 's fetus . Police also said evidence links Patino to a letter received June 25 by the Fayetteville Observer newspaper . In it , the writer claimed to have killed Touma and said more killings were planned . The letter was signed with a circular symbol similar to one used by the Zodiac killer in California in the late 1960s . At the request of police , the newspaper withheld information regarding the letters and delayed publishing a story for several days to allow police to conduct an investigation , Bergamine said . Police also received a similar letter . Fayetteville police Sgt. Chris Corcione said both letters were postmarked June 24 and sent from Fayetteville . Patino purchased a typewriter the day before the letters were sent , Corcione said . That typewriter is now in police custody . Police , however , stopped short of saying Patino wrote the letters , saying only that evidence links him to them . Two of Touma 's friends , who are also female soldiers and asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said Touma and Patino had been stationed together in Germany and had dated . They said Patino had proposed to Touma in Germany , but when the two returned to North Carolina , she discovered that he was married . Police said Wednesday that Patino was a person of interest from the early days of their investigation . Corcione said his initial interview with authorities could be described as `` deceptive , '' and officials had little other contact with him until his arrest . Police have found no criminal record for him . `` We felt like from the beginning , there was no major concerns of a serial killer being out there , '' Bergamine said . Patino was being held without bail at the Cumberland County Detention Center , Bergamine said . Asked what police believe the motive to be , Fayetteville police Detective Joshua Carter said , `` Right now , the motive is going to be held close . There 's still several months of investigation left to be conducted . '' `` I think one of the things that folks need to understand is that scientific evidence , things that have to go to the lab , they 're going to take time , '' Bergamine said . `` This is not the world of television and ` CSI . ' Things do n't get settled within a hour . '' Touma , a five-year Army veteran , had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg , Germany , and in Fort Drum , New York , before her stint at Fort Bragg . She is the second female soldier from Fort Bragg to die under suspicious circumstances since June . Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc was killed in early July . Her Fayetteville apartment was torched July 10 , and her charred body was found nearby a few days later . Her husband , Marine Cpl. John Wimunc , was charged with arson and first-degree murder in connection with the death . Another Marine , Lance Cpl. Kyle Alden , was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder . Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , also had a homicide case involving a female service member this year . The charred body of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , 20 , was found in the backyard of another Marine stationed at the base , Cpl. Cesar Laurean . Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she died . Laurean , who has been charged with first-degree murder , was arrested in Mexico in April , but because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico , he can not be immediately deported and must go through an extradition process . Authorities have said that if he chooses to fight extradition , it could take two years to return him to North Carolina . CNN 's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report .","question":""}

Ringo Starr , the only other surviving former Beatle , was there , as was iconic U.S. television host Barbara Walters , who reportedly played a role in introducing McCartney and Shevell , an American trucking heiress . Walters is Shevell 's second cousin , she said on her show `` The View '' in 2007 . McCartney and Shevell got engaged in May , a McCartney representative told CNN at the time . The wedding took place at the same venue where McCartney married his first wife , Linda , in 1969 . She died of breast cancer , aged 56 , in 1998 . A memorial service for her two months later was the first time McCartney , Starr and George Harrison appeared together in public since the Beatles split in 1970 .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Queen Elizabeth and the royal family cost British taxpayers an average of 66 pence -LRB- $ 1.32 -RRB- per person last year , Buckingham Palace announced Friday in its annual report of royal finances . The Queen and the royal family cost Britons a little bit more in the latest financial year . The total cost of the queen and royal family was 40 million pounds -LRB- $ 80 million -RRB- in the past fiscal year , an increase of 2 percent from the year before , according to the Royal Public Finances report . The man in charge of managing the queen 's financial affairs said she has tried to keep costs down , pointing out that the queen 's expenses are more than 3 percent lower in real terms than they were in 2001 . `` The reduction in the amount of head of state expenditure in real terms reflects the continuous attention the royal household pays to obtaining the best value for money in all areas of expenditure , '' said Alan Reid , whose official title is `` keeper of the privy purse . '' Funding for property maintenance at the royal palaces increased by almost 1 million pounds -LRB- $ 2 million -RRB- from the year before to 15.3 million pounds -LRB- $ 30.6 million -RRB- , but it will stay at that level for the next three years , the palace said . Reid warned that the money is not enough to deal with a backlog of maintenance work . `` This backlog relates to essential maintenance and does not include any allowance for projects such as the redecoration of the state rooms at Buckingham Palace , most of which were last redecorated before the queen 's reign , '' he said . Available funds are also unlikely for replacing the lead and slate roofs at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle -LRB- which would cost an estimated 16 million pounds , or $ 32 million -RRB- ; replacing heating and electrical wiring and removing asbestos at the palace -LRB- 2.4 million pounds , or $ 4.8 million -RRB- ; and replacing Victorian cast iron and lead water mains at the castle -LRB- 3 million pounds , or $ 6 million -RRB- . Travel was a major expense for the queen and her family over the past year , the reports showed . The most expensive trip was the queen 's six-day state visit to the United States , which cost a total of 414,042 pounds -LRB- about $ 828,000 -RRB- . It cost 316,061 pounds -LRB- about $ 632,000 -RRB- for Prince Charles and his wife , Camilla , to take an eight-day trip to Uganda and Turkey in November for Britain 's Foreign Office . Prince Andrew , the Duke of York , also had a series of expensive trips as part of his role as the United Kingdom 's special representative for international trade and investment . He visited more than 20 countries in that capacity last year , trying to attract investors to Britain and helping British companies improve their prospects overseas . `` This report is provided every year to show transparency in the royal accounts , '' said CNN royal watcher Richard Quest . `` It is often used as an example to show profligacy , for instance with the cost of the royal train , which runs around 20,000 pounds -LRB- $ 40,000 -RRB- a day .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He came out on court wearing a Halloween mask , but Novak Djokovic had to overcome a fright of his own before winning his comeback match in Switzerland on Tuesday . The world No. 1 , playing his first ATP Tour tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago , survived a second-set scare against Xavier Malisse before beating the Belgian 6-2 4-6 7-5 at the Swiss Indoors event . Djokovic suffered a recurring back injury in Serbia 's Davis Cup defeat by Argentina just days after beating Rafael Nadal in an epic final in New York . He missed tournaments in Asia , including the Shanghai Masters , but has returned to action in Basel where he was champion in 2009 and runner-up to Roger Federer last year . `` I 'm only just back from the biggest injury of my career , '' Djokovic said after extending his record this year to 65-3 . `` It was a big ask for me to have played really well . `` I could do nothing for four and a half weeks , I 've only been hitting for a week and a half . That 's not enough to play at my best . I 've lost rhythm . `` I had too many errors and too many double-faults . But I 'm happy just to be playing tennis again . I hope to build on this performance . '' As top seed , he is in the opposite half of the draw from Federer and new world No. 3 Andy Murray , who could meet in the semis . The 24-year-old will next play either Poland 's world No. 59 Lukasz Kubot or 91st-ranked German Tobias Kamke , who both came through the qualifying draw . Fifth seed Mardy Fish 's hopes of qualifying for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals suffered a blow when he was forced to retire with a hamstring injury against fellow American James Blake after winning the opening game . Fish holds the last of the eight places on offer for the London showpiece but could be overhauled if he has to miss the penultimate tournament in Paris starting next week . Blake will next play Kazakhstan 's Mikhail Kukushkin , a lucky loser from qualifying who upset American wildcard Donald Young in his opening match . Stanislas Wawrinka , a semifinalist in 2006 and the Swiss No. 2 behind Federer , beat Croatia 's Ivan Dodig 6-4 6-4 to set up a match with either Murray or Dutchman Robin Haase , who meet on Wednesday . Federer 's next match is against Jarkko Nieminen , after the Finn beat Brazil 's Thomaz Belluci 6-7 -LRB- 5-7 -RRB- 6-4 6-3 . Tomas Berdych had the sixth finals place ahead of his clash with Japan 's Kei Nishikori , but the Czech failed to earn any ranking points after losing 3-6 6-3 6-2 . Seventh-ranked Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga closed to within five points of Berdych by winning his opening match at the Valencia Open on Tuesday .

{"answer":"Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani officials have detained a 10th person in connection with the investigation into the failed May 1 car bombing of New York 's Times Square , a Pakistani intelligence source told CNN Tuesday . The intelligence source , who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media , identified the man as Shoaib Mughal . He is suspected of having served as an intermediary between the bombing suspect , Faisal Shahzad , and the Pakistani Taliban , the source said . Mughal 's uncle , who also asked not to be identified , told CNN that Mughal , who is married , owns and operates a computer parts store in Islamabad . The uncle said six men dressed in civilian clothing detained Mughal , who has never been outside Pakistan , at his shop on May 6 . In addition , a Pakistani intelligence source told CNN that detainee Muhammad Shahid Hussain was a friend of Faisal Shahzad when the bombing suspect was studying in the United States . The two men met frequently last year , when Shahzad returned to Pakistan , the source said . Hussain 's brother , Muhammad Khalid , told CNN that Hussain traveled to the United States in 2000 to participate in an MBA program and remained there until 2004 . Hussain 's brother and father , Muhammad Ramzan , have denied he has any links to terrorist groups or the attempted bombing in Times Square . The intelligence official added that another suspect , Major Adnan , resigned from the Pakistani Army last year . The official said Adnan contacted Shahzad by e-mail at least once but the official did not disclose when the e-mail was sent or what it contained . This month , a senior administration official said Shahzad , a Pakistani-American , was looking for help from the Pakistani Taliban in carrying out a bomb attack during his last visit to Pakistan . `` The question is : Did he go there looking for help or did he fall in their lap ? It seems the former . It appears he went seeking help for this attack , '' the official said . `` He had an attack in mind when he went there . '' The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because this person was n't allowed to speak publicly about the investigation . Top advisers to President Barack Obama said early this month that Shahzad worked with the Taliban movement in Pakistan . `` The evidence that we have now developed shows the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot , '' Attorney General Eric Holder told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on May 9 . John Brennan , assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security , told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban -- also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban , or TTP -- is `` closely allied with al Qaeda . '' Shahzad was arrested while trying to fly out of New York on May 3 , two days after federal authorities say he left a vehicle filled with explosive materials in Manhattan 's Times Square . The makeshift bomb failed to detonate . Shahzad had traveled to Pakistan several times in recent years , Brennan said . CNN 's Reza Sayah and Nasir Habib contributed to this story .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is set to deliver the Republican response to President Obama 's upcoming joint address to Congress , a high-profile slot the party often gives to one of its rising stars . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , 37 , will give GOP response to President Obama 's address to Congress this month . `` Gov. Jindal embodies what I have long said : The Republican Party must not be simply the party of ` opposition , ' but the party of better solutions , '' House Minority Leader John Boehner said in a Wednesday statement . Jindal , a former congressman in his first term as Louisiana 's governor , was widely believed to be on Republican presidential nominee John McCain 's short list for vice president , and he often served as a campaign surrogate on the Arizona senator 's behalf . The 37-year-old son of Indian immigrants also was given a prime-time speaking slot at the GOP convention last September , though he ultimately decided not to attend the four-day event as Hurricane Gustav headed for landfall in his state . An Ivy League grad and Rhodes Scholar , and his state 's first nonwhite governor , Jindal has long been on the GOP 's radar screen as a potential future leader and likely presidential candidate . And as the GOP is launching full-scale efforts to appeal to nonwhite voters , Jindal has become one of the party 's most high-profile minorities . `` His stewardship of the state of Louisiana , dedication to reforming government and commitment to bringing forth new and innovative ideas make him a leader not just within the Republican Party , but in our nation as a whole , '' Boehner also said of Jindal on Wednesday . Jindal , who became governor two years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana , has drawn praise for spearheading the ongoing recovery efforts . `` When you look at major statewide offices Republicans have won over the past three years , there is one , Louisiana , '' said Alex Castellanos , a CNN contributor and Republican strategist . `` In a state where we lost confidence in government , perhaps more than any other state , he restored it and cut taxes . '' Though he is often mentioned as a likely contender for the 2012 Republican presidential race , Jindal has said his current focus is on winning reelection in 2011 . Jindal also said late last year that even if he were considering running for president , now is the time to support the sitting president . `` It does n't matter whether you 're Republican , Democrat or independent , it does n't matter whether you voted for him or not , President-elect Barack Obama is our president , '' he said . The White House announced on Tuesday that Obama will deliver the annual State of the Union address to both houses of Congress on February 24 . In 2008 , Democrats tapped Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius -- then considered to be a possible vice presidential candidate -- to give the rebuttal speech to former President Bush 's final State of the Union address . Other Democrats who delivered responses to Bush 's State of the Unions include Virginia Sen. Jim Webb , Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , and former Washington Gov. Gary Locke , the nation 's first Chinese-American governor . The last Republican to deliver a response to a State of the Union address was Maine Sen. Susan Collins in 2000 .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dozens of suspected terrorists released by the United States from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , are believed to have returned to terrorism activities , according to the Pentagon . Pentagon officials say 61 former Gitmo detainees have committed or are suspected of returning to terrorism . Since 2002 , 61 former detainees have committed or are suspected to have committed attacks after being released from the detention camp , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said at a briefing Tuesday . The number is up since the Pentagon 's last report in March 2008 when officials said 37 former detainees had been suspected of returning to the battlefield since 2002 . Since 2007 , more than 100 detainees were released , significantly more than in previous years , according to Pentagon officials . According to the statistics , of the 61 former detainees that are believed to have returned to fighting , 18 have been officially confirmed while 43 are suspected , Morrell said . The 18 were confirmed through intelligence , photographs , fingerprints and other information , Morrell said . Of the 43 other detainees suspected of taking part in terrorist attacks , only `` plausible reporting '' on their activities indicated some kind of involvement , according to Morrell . Officials would only identify one of the confirmed attackers , Adballah Salih al-Ajmi , a Kuwaiti man released from U.S. custody at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2005 . Pentagon officials said Salih al-Ajmi blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq in April 2008 . Since 2002 , the Pentagon has released about 520 detainees to their home countries or counties that agreed to take them . Some have been released in full by those countries while others are still being held . `` There , clearly , are people who are being held at Guantanamo who are still bent on doing harm to America , Americans and our allies , so there will have to be some solution for the likes of them , '' Morrell said . About 250 detainees remain held at Guantanamo and about 60 of those detainees have been cleared for release by the Pentagon , but their home countries will not take them or the U.S. believes they could be harmed by their governments if returned . President-elect Barack Obama has said he intends to shut down Guantanamo . Earlier this week , two sources close to the Obama transition team said he could issue an order to do so as early as his first week in office , saying that Obama believes `` the legal framework at Gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A double strike from Welsh winger Gareth Bale helped Tottenham to a 3-1 English Premier League win over QPR on Sunday , a result that lifts them up to fifth place in the table and keeps their unbeaten run going . Dutchman Rafael Van der Vaart was also on target for Harry Redknapp 's side , who have not lost in 11 matches since their 5-1 home defeat by Manchester City back in August . Bale put the home side ahead in the 19th minute when he fired home an angled drive after a long ball from the back was headed on by Emmanuel Adebayor . And a rampant Tottenham doubled their advantage 13 minutes later when Van der Vaart picked up a mis-hit shot from Ledley King to place the ball inside the far post . QPR fought back after the break and halved the arrears on the hour mark when Jay Bothroyd nodded home from close range . But Tottenham sealed their victory with a superb goal 18 minutes from time , with Aaron Lennon and Bale exchanging a series of passes outside the box before Bale curled home a shot that gave keeper Paddy Kenny no chance . Manchester City still blaze a trail at the top of the table , with nine wins and a draw from 10 matches . They lie on 28 points , five clear of rivals Manchester United . Chelsea , Newcastle and Tottenham are all level on 19 points but Chelsea have played a game more and unbeaten Newcastle will move up to third position if they get at least a draw against Stoke on Monday night .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The second-highest ranking official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani 's political party resigned Saturday , along with four other high-ranking Kurdish politicians , officials said . Iraqi President Jalal Talabani could be jeopardized by the resignations of five key members of his party . Khosrat Rasul , the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government , resigned , along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , according to Kurdish lawmakers . Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan , a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq . It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . `` It looks very serious , '' said Ala Talabani , the president 's niece and a PUK member , as well as a member of Parliament . She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya , long a stronghold of the PUK . `` It 's about corruption , '' Ala Talabani said of the resignations . `` They are asking about the resources and the money . Who is spending it . And who is in charge of the income of the party . '' `` It 's not good , '' said Mahmoud Othman , a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician . `` The PUK is one of the main two -LSB- Kurdish -RSB- players , '' he added . `` A problem like this will upset the whole situation . '' Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad 's control after the 1991 Gulf War . Since then , the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions , Talabani 's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party , led by Massoud Barzani . For several years throughout the 1990s , the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq . Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States ' overthrow of Hussein . For the past five years , the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region 's position in Iraq . Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions . They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan 's militia of pesh merga fighters . Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians . The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani , the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history . `` If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow , this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics , '' said Hiwa Osman , the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting . Iraq 's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May . Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms . This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers . Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan have comfortably beaten Denmark 3-1 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg to book their place in the last 16 of the World Cup . First half goals from Keisuke Honda and Yasuhito Endo gave the Danes a mountain to climb . They never looked like they would recover and a miserable night was completed when Shinji Okazaki added a third in the 87th minute , shortly after a Jon Dahl Tomasson 81st minute goal had given Denmark a glimmer of hope . The Danes were comprehensively outplayed by Japan who produced their most resolute and skilful display of the tournament so far . As runners up in Group E Japan will now face Paraguay in Pretoria on Tuesday for a place in quarter-finals . The three-time Asian Cup champions join Netherlands , who confirmed first place in the group by beating an already-eliminated Cameroon 2-1 in Cape Town . A first half strike from Robin van Persie and a second by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar seven minutes from time ensured Netherlands finished with a 100 percent record at the top of Group E setting up a second round clash with Italy 's vanquishers Slovakia in Durban on Monday . Champions Italy crash out of World Cup The win over Cameroon team in Cape Town completed a comfortable group stage for the Dutch , despite not playing their best football . They will be boosted though by the return of Arjen Robben who came on as a second half substitute . Japan 3-1 Denmark Denmark , who needed to win the match to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages , started their match with Japan brightly . Skipper Jon Dahl Tomasson saw a chance go narrowly wide in the opening minutes . But two Japanese strikes within 13 minutes of each other stunned the Danes . Honda gave Japan the lead in the 17th minute with fine free kick which flew past keeper Thomas Sorensen who appeared to be deceived by the flight of the ball . Yasuhito Endo doubled Japan 's lead in the 30th minute when he curled a beautifully executed free kick around the Danish wall and past the despairing dive of Sorenson . If the Danish keeper was possibly at fault for the first goal , there was nothing he could do with Endo 's strike which found the bottom left corner of the net . The second half did n't get any better for the Danish keeper when he fumbled an innocuous looking free kick from Yasuhito Endo . His blushes were saved when the ball cannoned to safety off his right hand post . Jon Dahl Tomasson scored for Denmark in the 81st minute , turning in the rebound from his own penalty kick which had been awarded for a push on Daniel Agger . But it was too little too late for the 1992 European Champions . Moments later , Okazaki scored a third for Japan after Keisuke Honda unselfishly laid the ball on for him . It sealed a memorable win and qualification for the last 16 on foreign soil for the first time in their history . But man-of-the-match Honda believes Japan could go even further in the tournament . `` I expected to be really jubilant but I 'm not as jubilant as I thought I would be because I do n't think we are finished here . I believe we can go further in this competition , '' the CSKA Moscow star said , AFP reported . Netherlands 2-1 Cameroon Robin Van Persie opened the scoring for Netherlands in the 36th minute . Playing a neat one-two with Rafael van der Vaart on the edge of Cameroon 's penalty area , the Arsenal striker then fired a low shot under keeper Souleymanou to register his first goal of the tournament . Inter Milan 's Samuel Eto'o leveled the scores in the 65th minute after Cameroon were awarded a penalty by the Chilean referee , Pablo Pozo when Rafael van der Vaart raised an arm to block Geremi 's free-kick in the box . Eto'o stepped up to score his second goal of the tournament . The introduction of Arjen Robben -- his first appearance at the 2010 World Cup -- immediately created panic in the Cameroon defense . Cutting in from the right , Robben fired a shot from 20 yards which rebounded off the post . The ball fell kindly to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar who coolly slotted home the ball into an empty net and secure victory for Netherlands .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Masters -- April 9-12 , 2009 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson puts the green jacket on 2008 winner Trevor Immelman . While The Open Championship at St Andrews , Scotland may rival it for history , few would argue that the U.S. Masters tournament is unrivalled in terms of beauty and exclusivity . Played at the prestigious Augusta National Golf club in the city of Augusta , Georgia , the first `` major '' of the golfing year is a strictly invitational event controlled by the club itself . The top 50 golfers in the official world rankings are all guaranteed an invite . The dramatic azalea-draped course -- the brainchild of golfing great Bobby Jones -- provides a tough test for the world 's elite golfers , particularly since it has been lengthened or `` Tiger-proofed '' in recent years . However the relatively short 12th hole , named Golden Bell , is arguably the most challenging . Jack Nicklaus once called it `` the hardest tournament hole in golf , '' due to the fact that its perilously narrow green is protected in front by Rae 's Creek , with two sand traps behind it . Misjudge the wind or get your club selection wrong and the ball will most likely end up in the water . Since Horton Smith won the inaugural Masters title in 1934 , the tournament has become as famous for its traditions as it has for the quality of golf on show . Winners are presented with a green jacket by the defending champion -- which they are obliged to return to the clubhouse the following year . Nicklaus , nicknamed the `` Golden Bear , '' became the first golfer to successfully defend his green jacket . He also holds the record for the most titles won at Augusta with six -- his last coming in 1986 at the age of 46 . American players currently dominate the competition , following a period in the 1980s and 1990s which saw European players , including Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo , win 10 titles in 17 years . Current world number one Tiger Woods has won four times at Augusta since 1997 , while compatriot and rival for top spot , Phil Mickelson , won in 2004 and 2006 . South Africa 's Trevor Immelman is the current owner of the coveted green jacket . 2008 season in pictures '' U.S. Open - June 15-21 , 2009 Tiger Woods and his caddie walk up to the 18th green on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park in 2002 . The second of the four major tournaments , the U.S. Open is hosted by the United States Golf Association -LRB- USGA -RRB- . Since its inaugural event in 1895 at the Newport Golf and Country Club , the event has been staged at a number of different courses . What 's your favorite tournament ? It was n't until 1913 that the U.S. Open championship really caught the imagination when a young American amateur , Francis Ouimet , stunned the golf world by defeating famous English professionals , Harry Vardon and Ted Ray , in a playoff . The format of the tournament has changed several times . The USGA extended the championship to 72 holes in 1898 , with 36 holes played on each of two days . In 1926 , the format was changed to 18 holes played each of two days , then 36 holes on the third day . In 1965 , the present format of four 18-hole daily rounds was implemented for the first time . Over the years , much has been made of the way U.S. Open courses have been set up , with incredibly tough pin positions and rough thick enough to require a compass to navigate through . `` Sometimes the players feel -LSB- the USGA -RSB- has gotten a little close to the edge on some holes , '' defending champion Retief Goosen told the BBC at Pinehurst , North Carolina in 2005 . Two years later , when Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania hosted the tournament , World Golf.com quoted Tiger Woods as saying `` a 10-handicapper did n't stand a chance at breaking 100 '' on a course that boasts over 200 deep bunkers . Bobby Jones , Jack Nicklaus , Ben Hogan , Willie Anderson and Hale Irwin have all triumphed at the U.S. Open on four occasions , while Woods , who won last year 's event at Torrey Pines following a dramatic playoff victory over Rocco Mediate , counts three so far among his haul of 14 major titles . The U.S. Open is the only major that requires participants to play-off over 18 holes . This year 's event at Bethpage State Park 's Black Course in Farmingdale , New York should be familiar to Woods , as he won here in 2002 . At 7,214-yards , the municipally-owned Bethpage was the longest U.S. Open course in history . The aptly-named Black Course even carries a warning sign about its difficulty on the first tee . In 2002 , American Hale Irwin missed the cut for only the sixth time in 33 Open starts after two torrid rounds of 82 and 81 . `` They can go out and write a new book and title it , ` Massacre at ... wherever the heck we are , '' U.S. Open.com quoted him as saying . It remains to be seen whether the recently-injured Tiger can tame the course once again . Watch more about Woods ' comeback '' The Open Championship -- July 16-19 , 2009 Padraig Harrington -LRB- right -RRB- and Greg Norman line up putts during the 2008 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale . Organized by the R&A , which takes its name from Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews , Scotland , The -LRB- British -RRB- Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments . It is also the only one held outside of the United States . First held in October , 1860 , The Open was mostly played in Scotland during its early years . Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire was the birthplace of the event , which saw just eight players compete in its inaugural year . A year later the tournament was declared open to the whole world and the event has been known simply as `` The Open '' ever since . Since the early days , the R&A has established a rota of British seaside `` links '' courses to host the event . The major difference between a links course and a parkland course -- such as Augusta -- is that it is far less manufactured . Links courses are constructed out of the sandy , windswept coastal terrain , with few `` man-made '' additions . Players are faced with thick rough , narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes , and lightening quick greens . There are far fewer trees and water hazards . When the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination . This year 's tournament will be held on the famous Ailsa course at Turnberry on the west coast of Scotland . With its dramatic views and elevated cliff-top holes , the 7,200 yard course previously hosted The Open in 1977 , 1986 , 1994 . The winning aggregate scores in 1977 and 1994 rank among the lowest recorded in Open history , largely because the wind was n't blowing as it can . Current Open champion Padraig Harrington will arrive at Turnberry looking to win the tournament for the third time in as many years . At Carnoustie in 2007 , Harrington became the first Irishman to win The Open since Fred Daly in 1947 . He defended his title the following year at Royal Birkdale , finishing four strokes ahead of England 's Ian Poulter . Harrington has a long way to go before matching the great Harry Vardon 's record of six Open victories between 1896 and 1914 . Surprisingly , U.S. golfers -- more used to parkland courses -- have enjoyed great success in the competition in recent years , with 10 wins in 12 years . Tiger Woods , who missed out through injury last year , lifted the Claret Jug in 2000 , 2005 and 2006 . U.S. PGA Championship -- August 10-16 , 2009 Harrington pumps his fist as he sinks a putt to win the 2008 U.S. PGA Championship at Oakland Hills . The final major of the year , The PGA Championship is organized by the Professional Golfers Association of America -LRB- PGA of America -RRB- and is also held at a different course each year . The brainchild of New York salesman Rodman Wannamaker , the first PGA Championship was held at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville , New York in 1916 -- the same year the PGA of America was founded . The winners ' trophy is named after him . The competition , which was only switched from a matchplay to a strokeplay format in 1958 , does not allow amateurs to compete . It always attracts a world class field , in addition to a number of ordinary club professionals in the United States who can qualify through a national tournament . This year 's tournament will be held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska , Minnesota , the scene of Rich Beem 's defeat of a charging Tiger Woods in 2002 . Beem , an unknown club professional who also sold car stereos , held off Woods by recording birdies in his final four holes for a 68 that gave him victory by just one shot . The 7,149-yard course is ranked among the top courses in the United States , according to the PGA . Its signature 16th hole features a wide open fairway that narrows into a long peninsula featuring an elevated green protected by Lake Hazeltine . This year Padraig Harrington will attempt to defend the trophy , a year after he pulled off a dramatic victory over Spain 's Sergio Garcia at Oakland Hills . If he succeeds he will become only the second man -- after Tiger Woods -- to be back-to-back PGA Champion . However , both men lag behind Jack Nicklaus , who won a record-equaling fifth U.S.PGA title in 1980 at Oak Hill , Rochester -- the hometown of Walter Hagen , the player whose record Nicklaus tied .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq 's presidency council Thursday approved the U.S.-Iraq security agreement -- the final step for the agreement to be ratified by the Iraqi government , a council spokesman said . The pact allows the presence of American troops in Iraq for three more years . U.S. soldiers gather at the `` Crossed Swords '' in Baghdad 's secure Green Zone on Tuesday . The three-member presidency council -- Kurdish President Jalal Talabani , Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi -- approved the agreement unanimously a week after the Iraqi parliament passed the measure . Under the Iraqi constitution , unanimous approval by the presidency council is required for ratification of a law or agreement . The security pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year . The agreement , reached after months of negotiations , sets June 30 , 2009 , as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns . The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31 , 2011 . The agreement -- which stresses respect for Iraqi sovereignty -- `` requests the temporary assistance '' of U.S. forces , but severely restricts their role . The pact says that all military operations are to be carried out with the agreement of Iraq and must be `` fully coordinated '' with Iraqis . A Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee will oversee military operations . Iraq has the `` primary right to exercise jurisdiction '' over U.S. forces `` for grave premeditated felonies , '' the agreement says . Suspects can be held by U.S. forces but must be available to Iraqi authorities for investigation or trial . Iraq also will have the `` primary right to exercise jurisdiction '' over U.S. contractors and their employees under the agreement . Also , the pact says that `` Iraqi land , sea and air should n't be used as a launching or transit point for attacks against other countries . '' The presidency council also approved a U.S.-Iraqi bilateral pact called the strategic framework agreement , which covers a wide range of bilateral cooperation efforts and which was approved by the Iraqi parliament last week . U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. Crocker and Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. military official in Iraq , issued a statement welcoming the council 's ratification of the measures . `` We look forward , under these agreements , to the continued reduction in U.S. forces and the normalization of bilateral relations as two sovereign and co-equal nations , '' the two said in their statement . `` We will undertake initiatives to strengthen our cooperation in the fields of economics , energy , health , the environment , education , culture , and law enforcement . The United States will support Iraq 's request to the U.N. Security Council to continue protection of Iraqi assets , '' the statement said .","question":""}
{"answer":"CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Impeached former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who was arrested in December on charges of conspiracy and fraud , was indicted Thursday on 16 felony counts by a federal grand jury , the U.S. attorney 's office said . Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is facing such charges as racketeering , conspiracy and wire fraud . The 19-count indictment charges Blagojevich and some of his closest aides and advisers with a wide-ranging `` scheme to deprive the people of Illinois of honest government , '' according to a statement by the attorney 's office . Blagojevich , 52 , faces charges including racketeering , conspiracy , wire fraud and making false statements to investigators , according to the release . Three counts in the indictment are against the aides and advisers . In a written statement , Blagojevich maintained his innocence -- as he has done throughout a political soap opera that captivated the nation . `` I 'm saddened and hurt but I am not surprised by the indictment , '' he said . `` I am innocent . I now will fight in the courts to clear my name . '' Blagojevich was vacationing with his family in Florida on Thursday . In video shot at a Disney resort outside Orlando , Florida , by CNN affiliate WESH-TV , he declined to comment on his legal situation . He was filmed shortly before the indictments were handed down . In the WESH video , the ex-governor was sitting near a pool at the resort . `` I 'm enjoying Disney World with my kids and I do n't think you 're supposed to be here , '' said Blagojevich , after his wife attempted to shield him from the camera . `` I 'm happy to talk to you at the appropriate time . '' A man who identified himself only as `` someone who knows who he is '' then blocked the camera . U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , said he hoped the former governor would n't use the announcement as a reason to hit the media circuit again . `` We can only hope the former governor will not view this indictment as a green light for another publicity tour , '' he said . `` Rod Blagojevich deserves his day in court , but the people of Illinois deserve a break . '' Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris , were arrested in December on federal corruption charges alleging that , among other things , they conspired to sell President Obama 's vacant U.S. Senate seat . Harris and Blagojevich 's brother , Robert Blagojevich , were among the others indicted on Thursday . In early January , federal Judge James Holderman gave the attorney 's office three additional months to decide whether to indict Blagojevich , who was impeached by the state legislature and resigned from office . That deadline ends Tuesday . On Thursday , current Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn called the charges a reminder for political leaders in the state to help stamp out corruption , and he pledged to `` work night and day to clean up our government . '' `` Today , more than ever , I 'm committed to making sure our government has fundamental reform from top to bottom , '' said Quinn , also a Democrat and the former lieutenant governor who was appointed governor in January . `` We need to overhaul Illinois government to make sure everything is done right for the people . '' The charges are part of what investigators have dubbed `` Operation Board Games , '' an ongoing investigation into political corruption in the state . Among the specific claims in the 75-page indictment are that Blagojevich schemed with others in 2002 , even before he took office , to use his position to make money , which they would split after he left office . Blagojevich is accused of denying state business to companies that would not hire his wife , extorting campaign contributions from a children 's hospital that was set to get state money and pressuring a racetrack executive to give political contributions before the governor signed a gambling bill . The indictment said that after Obama was elected president , Blagojevich began meeting with others to figure out a way he could make money from his position to appoint a replacement senator . It said Blagojevich asked others , including state employees , to contact people who may be interested in the seat , and that he believed an associate of someone referred to in the indictment as `` Senate Candidate A '' had offered $ 1.5 million in campaign contributions in exchange for the appointment . He had asked his brother to meet with an associate of `` Senate Candidate A '' and say that some of those contributions needed to come through before he made the appointment , but the meeting was canceled after a newspaper article reported that Blagojevich had been recorded talking about selling the seat . A lengthy FBI affidavit alleges that Blagojevich was intercepted on court-authorized wiretaps trying to profit from the Senate vacancy . The indictment said that Blagojevich communicated `` directly and with the assistance of others '' with people he believed were in contact with Obama , trying to gain political favor by possibly appointing someone the president-elect supported . He ultimately appointed a former state comptroller and attorney general , Roland Burris , who was seated in the Senate despite protests from the chamber 's Democratic leaders . Those leaders said a special election should be called because of the controversy over the appointment . `` The U.S. Attorney 's indictment serves to confirm the public 's long-standing distrust of former Gov. Blagojevich and his administration , and it underscores the culture of corruption that has afflicted our state for far too long , '' state Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a written statement . `` While this is a terrible day in Illinois history , it is also a moment in which we can recognize an opportunity for real reform . '' Thursday 's charges supersede the ones filed in December . The Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in January to impeach Blagojevich , accusing him of abusing his gubernatorial power . Blagojevich faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the 15 most serious charges in the indictment , and five years on a single indictment of making false statements . The government also charges that Blagojevich has bought property with money he got illegally , and is going after homes he owns in Chicago and Washington . `` I would ask the good people of Illinois to wait for the trial and afford me the presumption of innocence that they would give to all their friends and neighbors , '' Blagojevich , who was vacationing with his family , said in the statement . In addition to the Blagojevich brothers and Harris , also charged in the indictments were businessman and fundraiser Christopher Kelly , 50 ; lobbyist and longtime Blagojevich associate Alonzo Monk , 50 ; and William F. Cellini Sr. , 74 , another businessman who raised money for Blagojevich .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter and dumping her body in Galveston Bay in Texas has pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence in the case . Kimberly Dawn Trenor is scheduled to go on trial for murder next week in the death of her daughter . But Kimberly Dawn Trenor , 20 , pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge , her lawyer said Wednesday . Trenor and her husband , Royce Clyde Zeigler II , 25 , both were charged with tampering with evidence and capital murder in the case of Riley Ann Sawyer , whose body was found in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay , Texas , in October 2007 . The charge of tampering with evidence accused the couple of concealing the child 's remains . Trenor was arraigned Tuesday in Galveston , Texas , said her lawyer , Tom Stickler . Jury selection for her trial on the capital murder charge begins Wednesday . The trial will begin in earnest on January 27 , he said . The jury also will sentence Trenor on the evidence tampering charge , which carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison , The Houston Chronicle reported . Zeigler , who is being tried separately , has not been formally arraigned , Stickler said . Both remain in jail . The Houston Chronicle reported bail had been set at $ 850,000 each . Riley Ann 's case garnered national headlines after a fisherman found her body on the island in the bay . Authorities were unsure of her identity , and police dubbed her '' Baby Grace . '' Police distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide , and Sheryl Sawyers , the girl 's paternal grandmother , contacted police from her Ohio home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter . DNA testing confirmed the child 's identity . According to an affidavit , Trenor told police Riley had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held underwater before she died on July 24 , 2007 . She said the couple hid the girl 's body in a storage shed for one to two months before they put it in the plastic container and dumped it into the bay . A medical examiner said Riley 's skull was fractured in three places , injuries that would have been fatal . A cross has since been erected on the island where the child was found , which was named Riley 's Island in her honor , the Houston Chronicle reported . Trenor moved to Texas from Ohio with the girl in May 2007 to be with Zeigler , whom Trenor had met on the Internet . While in custody , Trenor gave birth this summer to another child , who is now in the care of relatives , Stickler said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She had many plans for the future : to go to college , start a career , meet the man of her dreams , raise a family -- when the time was right . Expert : `` There 's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value . '' It was all cut off by an unexpected pregnancy . The baby became her life , consuming her energy and forcing her dreams to the back burner of her life . She is 19 or younger and Latina , and has had her first baby . It 's not what she wanted . Nor did her parents , who are the greatest influence on her decisions about sex , according to a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday by experts on the Hispanic community in the United States . The survey also found that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen 's future . Somewhere along the way , the aspirations fail to match up to reality . The survey attempts to examine some of the reasons for the disparity and why Latinas now have the highest teen birth rate among all ethnic and racial groups in the United States . `` There 's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value , '' said Ruthie Flores , senior manager of the National Campaign 's Latino Initiative . According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , 53 percent of Latinas get pregnant in their teens , about twice the national average . After a period of decline , the birth rate for U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 years rose in 2007 by about 1 percent , to 42.5 births per 1,000 , according to preliminary data in a March 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Health Statistics . In 2007 , the birth rate among non-Hispanic whites ages 15 to 19 was 27.2 per 1,000 , and 64.3 per 1,000 for non-Hispanic black teens in the same age range . The teen birth rate among Hispanic teens ages 15 to 19 was 81.7 per 1,000 . Of the 759 Latino teens surveyed , 49 percent said their parents most influenced their decisions about sex , compared with 14 percent who cited friends . Three percent cited religious leaders , 2 percent teachers and 2 percent the media . Watch more on the survey results '' Three-quarters of Latino teens said their parents have talked to them about sex and relationships , but only half said their parents discussed contraception . The survey also found that : \u2022 74 percent of Latino teens believe that parents send one message about sex to their sons and a different message altogether to their daughters , possibly related to the Latino value of machismo . \u2022 Latino teens believe that the most common reason teens do not use contraception is that they are afraid their parents might find out . \u2022 72 percent of sexually experienced teens say they wish they had waited . \u2022 34 percent of Latino teens believe that being a teen parent would prevent them from reaching their goals , but 47 percent say being a teen parent would simply delay them from reaching their goals . \u2022 76 percent said it is important to be married before starting a family . Flores said it is crucial to understand the beliefs and attitudes that influence teen behavior in order to reduce the high rates of Hispanic teen pregnancy . The survey , co-sponsored by the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza , was an attempt to to do just that . She said that despite a rich culture and the growing influence of Hispanics in America , the Latino community disproportionately suffers from troubling social indicators . Consider that fewer than six in 10 Latino adults in the United States have a high school diploma . Latino teens are more likely to drop out than their non-Hispanic counterparts , and of all the children living in poverty , 30 percent are Latino . `` Teen pregnancy is not an isolated issue , '' Flores said . `` It 's related to poverty , to dropout rates . That 's going to have an impact on our national as a whole . '' Flores said 69 percent of Latino teen moms drop out of high school , and the children of teen mothers are less likely to do well in school themselves and often repeat grades . `` That has a big economic impact , '' Flores said . It 's an impact that is sure to be noticed . The nation 's 45 million Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States with a growth rate twice that of the general population . That means by 2025 , one-quarter of all American teens will be Latinos .","question":""}

The superdelegates are a group of about 800 party leaders and officials who vote at the convention for the candidate of their choice . But the popular vote count is debatable . If all the primary results including Florida and Michigan are counted , but not the caucus votes , Clinton leads in the popular vote 17,461,845 to Obama 's 17,244,762 , according to CNN estimates . That number includes giving Obama all the `` uncommitted '' votes from Michigan . Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early . Clinton won both states , but Obama 's name was not even on the ballot in Michigan . The Democratic National Committee decided Saturday to reinstate all of Florida and Michigan 's delegates to the national convention , with each delegate getting a half-vote to penalize the two states for holding their primaries earlier than party rules allowed . The DNC 's Rules and Bylaws Committee 's move gave Clinton 87 delegates and Obama 63 . In a second scenario , which adds in CNN 's estimate of the caucus-goers , Obama leads Clinton 17,928,000 to 17,843,000 . And in a third scenario , which includes all of the caucuses but does not give Obama Michigan 's `` uncommitted '' vote , Clinton leads 17,873,000 to 17,703,000 . Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence that Obama would clinch the nomination in the coming days . `` If not Tuesday , I think it will be fairly soon , '' he said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` We hope this week , absolutely , '' he added . At a campaign stop in Mitchell , South Dakota , Obama congratulated Clinton for her win Sunday and praised her for being an `` outstanding public servant . '' `` She is going to be a great asset when we go into November to make sure that we defeat the Republicans , '' he said . Watch Obama rally in South Dakota '' As Clinton tries to win over the undecided superdelegates , she argued Sunday that she would be the stronger candidate to face Republican John McCain in the fall . `` In the final assessment , I ask you to consider these questions : Which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary ? Which candidate is best able to lead us to victory in November ? And which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad ? '' In the Puerto Rico primary , Clinton swept Obama in every major demographic group , including groups Obama generally wins , such as younger voters and higher-income voters , according to CNN 's exit polls . CNN estimated turnout to be between 325,000 and 425,000 . `` Most people in Puerto Rico , I would venture to guess , they are not even aware that there 's a primary going on , '' said Luis Pab\u00f3n-Roca , a local political analyst . Part of the reason for the lack of interest , he said , is because voters feel the primary is n't meaningful since Puerto Ricans can not vote in the general election . The Democratic and Republican parties run the primaries and caucuses , and they allow U.S. territories , such as the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , to take part in the process . But only the 50 states and the District of Columbia vote in the general election .

{"answer":"London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British government ministers secretly advised Libya on how to get convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi released from a life sentence in a Scottish prison , American documents published by WikiLeaks allege . A Foreign Office official explained to the Libyans how to apply for compassionate release for Megrahi after he was diagnosed with cancer , according to an October 2008 U.S. Embassy cable newly published by WikiLeaks . The British government believed Scotland would be inclined to grant the bomber compassionate release , the cable says . Megrahi , the only person convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 , which killed 270 , was released in 2009 . He is now living in Libya . Then-Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell wrote to Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdulati al-Obeidi in October 2008 to explain how to apply for compassionate release , a British official told the U.S. Embassy in London , the cable says . The Foreign Office in London and the office of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in Edinburgh did not respond immediately to CNN requests for comment . The British government has always said it was not its decision whether or not to release Megrahi , but that of the Scottish authorities because the bomber was imprisoned in Scotland . Scotland has some control over its own affairs , including justice , but London runs British foreign policy . Some American senators , led by New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez , have been furious about Megrahi 's release . They said in a report in December that his medical condition did not justify setting him free . The leaked U.S. Embassy cable says Megrahi had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and that the average life expectancy for someone with his condition was 18 months to two years . It noted that he could have as long as five years to live . The October 2008 American cable is broadly consistent with hundreds of documents about the case declassified by Scotland after Megrahi was released in August 2009 . Those documents and American diplomatic cables published earlier by WikiLeaks show that Libya was determined to win the release of Megrahi , warning London that it would react badly if the bomber died in jail . The British have consistently denied that commercial considerations -- such as oil giant BP 's desire to drill in Libya -- played a role in Megrahi 's release .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manager Jose Mourinho was sent off as Italian leaders Inter Milan crashed to a 2-1 defeat at title hopefuls Juventus on Saturday night . Second-placed AC Milan are now four points adrift of their city rivals after a 3-0 home crushing of Sampdoria , who remained in fifth . Ten-man Juve went third , five points behind Inter , after ending the defending champions ' eight-match unbeaten run in Serie A. Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo was credited with the 20th-minute opening goal in Turin as he deflected in a free-kick from compatriot Diego , and Mourinho was ordered from the dugout following his protestations about the foul being awarded in the first place . Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o leveled six minutes later with a header from Dejan Stankovic 's cross , but new Italy international Claudio Marchisio gave the home side victory in the 58th minute after goalkeeper Julio Cesar blocked a shot by midfielder Mohamed Sissoko . Melo was sent off with three minutes left for his second yellow card after aiming an elbow at Mario Balotelli , who was also booked for his theatrical reaction . The defeat was a blow to Inter 's confidence ahead of Wednesday 's Champions League showdown with Russia 's Rubin Kazan at the San Siro , with the winner earning a place in the knockout stages . AC Milan scored all three goals in the first half as striker Marco Borriello , who used to play for Sampdoria 's city rivals Genoa , headed the opener in the first minute from Ronaldinho 's cross . The Brazilian was in fine form , and also set up the second goal for Clarence Seedorf in the 21st minute as he threaded a neat pass to the veteran Dutch midfielder . Ronaldinho 's compatriot Alexandre Pato made it 3-0 just two minutes later with his seventh goal of the season , netting at the second attempt after goalkeeper Luca Castellazzi blocked his initial effort following a header on by Borriello . It was Milan 's fifth successive victory , with coach Leonardo taking Ronaldinho off at halftime as a precaution due to a slight knee problem ahead of Tuesday 's Champions League trip to FC Zurich , which will determine whether the Rossoneri qualify for the knockout stages . Sampdoria slumped to a third defeat in a week , having been knocked out of the Italian Cup by lowly Livorno in midweek following the embarrassing 3-0 derby defeat to Genoa last weekend .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill commemorating Harvey Milk , the first openly gay politician elected to public office in the state , a spokesman for the governor said Monday . Stuart Milk , nephew of Harvey Milk , sits next to a photo of the gay rights activist in March . `` He really saw this signing as a way to honor the gay community in California , '' spokesman Aaron McLear told CNN in a telephone interview . Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level . But since then , `` Milk has become much more of a symbol of the gay community , '' McLear said , citing the eponymous movie starring Sean Penn , Milk 's posthumous receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and his induction into the California Hall of Fame . Milk served briefly as San Francisco 's supervisor before he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in 1978 by Dan White , a city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back . Under the measure , the governor each year would proclaim May 22 -- Milk 's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state . The bill was one of 704 signed Sunday -- most of them near the midnight deadline -- by Schwarzenegger , said spokesman Aaron McLear . The legislation passed the state Senate in May and the state Assembly last month . The legislation has been divisive , with the governor 's office receiving more than 100,000 phone calls and e-mails , most of them in opposition , spokeswoman Andrea McCarthy said last month . But she added that most of the Twitter posts the governor received were in favor of the bill . Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level . Milk was a `` unique '' historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was `` assassinated in his public office for being who he was , '' State Sen. Mark Leno , a Democrat , told CNN last month . The day of significance would not close schools or state offices , according to its text . However , Randy Thomasson , the president of SaveCalifornia.com , said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools , including gay pride parades or `` mock gay weddings . '' `` Harvey Milk was a terrible role model for children , '' said Thomasson , whose organization opposed the bill . `` The reality is Harvey Milk is a hero to so many people and a great role model , '' said Geoff Kors , executive director of Equality California , the group that backed the bill introduced by Leno . `` It 's very appropriate that the state he worked in and passed the first gay rights bill in the country should honor him . '' He said the bill marks the first time any state has officially honored an openly gay person . Leno said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay-pride parades and similar activities were `` hyperbole . '' The bill `` mandates nothing , '' he said , although it `` affords an educational opportunity . '' President Obama posthumously honored Milk with a Presidential Medal of Freedom this year , and Sean Penn portrayed him in the 2008 film `` Milk , '' for which he received an Oscar for best actor .","question":""}

{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Corey Haim 's death is linked to an `` illegal and massive prescription-drug ring , '' California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday . Brown 's office is investigating `` an unauthorized prescription under the former child star 's name that was found during an ongoing investigation of fraudulent prescription-drug pads ordered from a vendor in San Diego . '' `` These prescriptions are very recent , and it involves Oxycontin and we 're not talking just 40 pills , more than that , '' Brown said in an interview Friday with CNN Radio . The announcement comes before the coroner has ruled on what killed Haim , the 1980s teen movie actor who struggled for decades with drug addiction . Haim , 38 , died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother , authorities said . `` Corey Haim 's death is yet another tragedy linked to the growing problem of prescription-drug abuse , '' Brown said . `` This problem is increasingly linked to criminal organizations , like the illegal and massive prescription-drug ring under investigation . '' Brown said the ring uses stolen doctor 's identities to order prescription-drug pads that are used to write counterfeit prescriptions . `` The doctor whose name is printed on the form is usually unaware that his or her identity has been stolen for this purpose , '' Brown said . Haim got two powerful drugs from a pharmacy 11 days before his death , according to a source with knowledge of the transaction . His primary-care doctor did not know about the prescriptions and called the pharmacy two days later to find out what Haim had been given , the source said . Brown 's announcement did not specify whether any of the prescription drugs found in Haim 's apartment after his death were illegally obtained . Several prescription-drug bottles were taken from Haim 's apartment , Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday . Although the bottles indicated the drugs included Vicodin , Valium and Soma , no tests have been done to confirm what they are , he said . Haim had a prescription for the muscle relaxer Soma and the narcotic pain reliever Norco filled at a pharmacy on February 26 , a source with knowledge of the transaction said . Two days after Haim personally picked up the drugs , his primary-care doctor called the San Fernando Valley pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions , the source said . The doctor said that `` Haim was not feeling well '' and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed for the actor , the source said . The source , who worked at the pharmacy , asked not to be identified because his employer had not authorized him to talk . Haim 's manager , Mark Heaslip , and close friend Corey Feldman both said Haim began seeing an addiction specialist two weeks before his death . Tiffany Shepis , who was engaged to be married to Haim last May , said on HLN 's `` Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell '' that he was taking large amounts of Valium and Vicodin during their yearlong relationship . `` You 're talking about a person that , at the time when I knew him , you know , was ingesting 40 some-odd pills a day , '' Shepis said . Although the autopsy showed Haim 's heart was enlarged and he had fluid in his lungs , the coroner 's chief investigator said a drug overdose has not been ruled out as the cause of the actor 's death . `` You can have somebody with an enlarged heart and some other medical conditions , but you do n't know if the actual cause of death is from illegal substances , medication or heart failure , '' Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter said Friday . Heaslip said the enlarged heart was evidence that Haim 's death was not caused by a drug overdose , but Winter disputed that . `` There were some preliminary findings and we agreed to let the mother know what those were , '' Winter said . `` It was explained to her that even though this is some preliminary findings that the doctor observed , there would n't be a final cause of death until the final toxicology tests are back . '' The cause of death may not be determined for another six weeks , Winter said . Feldman , a longtime friend and frequent co-star , asked Wednesday that people not `` jump the gun '' to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim . Heaslip , manager to both Feldman and Haim , said Haim had seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death . Haim was `` weaned down to literally zero medications '' by an addiction specialist in the two weeks before his death , Heaslip said . The doctor `` put him on a new line of medications , '' Feldman said on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' Wednesday . Haim 's death came as his career was picking up , with Haim booking `` movie after movie , '' Heaslip said . His latest film is set for release soon , he said . Haim 's most famous role was in the 1987 movie `` The Lost Boys , '' in which he appeared with Feldman . Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire . In later years , the two friends , who appeared in eight movies together , struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways . They reunited for a reality show , `` The Two Coreys , '' in 2007 , but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year . In a 2007 interview on CNN 's `` Larry King Live , '' Haim and Feldman discussed their battles with drugs . Feldman told King that he had gotten clean , but it took Haim longer . Haim called himself `` a chronic relapser for the rest of my life . '' `` I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything , '' he said . `` I mean , I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes , which is why I have a support group around me consistently . '' Haim was born December 23 , 1971 , in Toronto , Ontario , according to a biography on his Web site . He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series `` The Edison Twins . '' His first film role was in the 1984 American movie `` First Born . '' Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film `` Lucas . '' Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time , `` If he continues to act this well , he will never become a half-forgotten child star , but will continue to grow into an important actor . '' After `` The Lost Boys , '' Haim and Feldman appeared in `` License to Drive '' and `` Dream a Little Dream . '' CNN 's Brittany Kaplan and Jack Hannah contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A national campaign to inoculate tens of millions of Americans against H1N1 influenza began Monday , with health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee targeted as the first recipients , federal health authorities said . Health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee are among the first to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday . `` I think the world has watched history unfold , '' Dr. Judy Monroe , Indiana 's state health commissioner , told reporters at Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis . Earlier Monday , the hospital received a shipment of 52 boxes -- each containing 100 pre-filled sprayers . `` This first 5,200 doses that came to Marion County is really just the tip of the iceberg , '' Monroe said . Health Director Virginia Caine said the shipment will be split among the county 's hospitals . A similar scene unfolded at LeBonheur Children 's Medical Center in Memphis , Tennessee , where three children have died from H1N1 , sometimes referred to as swine flu . Jennilyn Utkov , a spokeswoman for LeBonheur , said the hospital received about 100 doses . By noon , the supply had been depleted . The vaccines shipped to both sites and to a few other places around the nation are the first of some 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Dr. Jay Butler told reporters at the Indianapolis event . That number includes both spray and injectable forms . Butler , who heads the agency 's 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force , has promised there will be enough for anyone who wants it . Butler said vaccine makers will ship 10 million to 20 million doses per week over the next couple of months . `` Is that fast enough ? '' he asked . `` No , but it 's what 's feasible . It 's what can be done . '' Monroe predicted that an ample supply of the injectable form will be available by mid-October . Last week , the CDC said it had received reports of 60 deaths of children related to H1N1 flu since April ; 11 of those deaths were reported last week alone . From August 30 until September 26 , the agency tallied 16,174 hospitalizations nationwide and 1,379 deaths associated with influenza virus infection . iReport.com : How should H1N1 be handled ?

Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women , children , young adults and people with chronic lung disease , heart disease or diabetes -- should be among the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus , health officials have said . Understanding the H1N1 virus '' According to a CNN\/Opinion Corp. poll in late August , two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu . Health care workers may not necessarily be foremost among them . In the past , about 40 percent of health care workers have opted to be vaccinated against the flu , according to the CDC . Health officials also have recommended people reduce their chances of getting sick by washing their hands frequently , sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one 's hand and staying home when sick . More than 340,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and more than 4,100 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization . Many countries -- including the United States -- have stopped counting cases , particularly of milder illness , meaning that the true number is likely much higher .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Albert Budacz was young , he prided himself on having good eyesight ; he never wore glasses . But as he eased into his late 40s , he could n't see as well . `` I noticed a change in my vision , '' he explained . `` Primarily in church when I would open a Bible , or something like that , I had to position myself under a light to see it . '' Ophthalmologist Dr. Sharon Solomon examined Albert Budacz and found age-related macular degeneration . Concerned that he was beginning to lose his sight , Budacz went to his ophthalmologist , Dr. Sharon Solomon with the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins . He was found to have the beginnings macular degeneration , an eye condition that occurs when the central portion of the retina -- called the macula -- begins to deteriorate . Until recently , people with age-related macular degeneration , the leading cause of severe vision loss in Americans older than 60 , had few treatment options . But now , thanks to new research and advancing technology , there are more vision-saving choices . Early signs of macular degeneration-related vision loss include shadowy areas or fuzzy distortion in a person 's central vision . `` A patient told me recently that he noticed when he was driving that the streetlights were slanted ; the poles themselves were slanted , '' Solomon said . `` That 's a classic sign of the beginning of this disease . '' Although obesity , smoking , high blood pressure and certain drugs can cause it , age is the primary risk factor . `` As people approach their 50s and later , they may have little yellow deposits that develop underneath the retina , and that 's called drusen , '' Solomon explained . `` Those deposits are the hallmark of what we call early age-related macular degeneration . '' There are two forms of age-related macular degeneration , or AMD : the dry form , known as non-neovascular , and the wet form , called neovascular . The dry form , which Budacz has , is more common . According to the National Eye Institute , about 85 to 90 percent of patients with advanced macular degeneration have the dry form . Dry macular degeneration is caused when drusen begin to accumulate in and around the macula . Drusen , those yellowish deposits , are debris from deteriorating tissue . With dry AMD , there is usually a gradual loss of central vision . Over a period of years , dry AMD can progress to a gradual deterioration of retinal cells , which can result in severe vision loss or lead to the wet version of AMD . As of now , there is no FDA-approved treatment for dry macular degeneration , although a few drugs and devices are in clinical trials . Health Minute : Watch more on new therapies for macular degeneration '' However , studies have shown that supplements and a healthy diet can slow the progression of dry macular degeneration . A recent National Eye Institute study found that certain nutrients such as beta carotene -LRB- vitamin A -RRB- and vitamins C and E may reduce the risk of progression of early-stage AMD by 25 percent . Solomon says these antioxidants have a positive effect . `` They 're known as ` preservision , ' '' she said , noting that they are commonly given to certain patient groups to slow their progression to advanced macular degeneration . Other research has shown that B6 , B12 and folic acid may help prevent age-related macular degeneration . In a study of more than 5,000 women , researchers noted those who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had a 34 percent lower risk of developing AMD then those taking a placebo . Although the studies showed strong results , the American Academy of Ophthalmology cautions patients to talk to their eye doctors about which supplements are best for their condition before they start popping vitamins . In the wet version of macular degeneration , abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid . This leakage causes permanent damage to light-sensitive retinal cells , which die off and create blind spots in central vision . Doctors say it 's the body 's misguided way of attempting to supply the retina with more nutrients and oxygen . Instead , the attempt creates scarring , leading to severe central vision loss . Up until recently , there 's been very little doctors could do for the wet form of macular degeneration . But over the past decade , there have been a few treatments developed to slow its progression . Cold lasers are now used to freeze the abnormal blood vessels responsible for destroying the macula ; they have a 60 percent success rate . And within the past three years , researchers pinpointed a protein in the eye , called vascular endothelial growth factor , that stimulates the development of blood vessels . Injectable drugs that inhibit VEGF are now FDA-approved and available ; without VEGF , there is little to encourage the growth of blood vessels in the retina . `` They actually have a 90 percent chance of stabilizing vision and a 30 to 40 percent chance of improving vision , '' Solomon said . `` This is the first therapy that we 've had that can actually -LSB- reverse -RSB- vision loss . '' Most ophthalmologists prefer an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure . They promote yearly eye exams as the easiest way to keep macular degeneration in check -- and warn against waiting for a crisis to schedule a checkup . `` We typically pick up a patient when , all of a sudden , they 've had an acute , abrupt loss of vision or change in the quality of their vision , '' Solomon said . `` And sometimes it 's too late . '' Albert Budacz was lucky . He caught his macular degeneration in time . He 's stopped smoking and takes antioxidants to slow the progression of the disease . And although he may not have the eyesight he had as a young man , he can still see pretty well with or without glasses . And to him , that 's all that matters .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band 's former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64 . As manager of the Sex Pistols and owner , with his then-lover Westwood , of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s , McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement . `` When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm , I thought he was beautiful and I still do , '' Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement .

'' McLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band 's brief , spectacular and controversial career . Originally known as the Strand , McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols .

And it is clear , I believe , that my record ... reflects my rigorous commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its terms , interpreting statutes according to their terms and Congress 's intent and hewing faithfully to precedents established by the Supreme Court and by my Circuit Court . In each case I have heard , I have applied the law to the facts at hand . '' Sotomayor said the `` process of judging is enhanced when the arguments and concerns of the parties to the litigation are understood and acknowledged . '' That , she noted , `` is why I generally structure my opinions by setting out what the law requires and then explaining why a contrary position , sympathetic or not , is accepted or rejected . That is how I seek to strengthen both the rule of law and faith in the impartiality of our judicial system . '' Watch Sotomayor talk about her judicial philosophy '' Sotomayor argued that her `` personal and professional experiences help -LSB- her -RSB- listen and understand , with the law always commanding the result in every case . '' Watch Sotomayor 's remarks to the Senators '' Some of Sotomayor 's critics have argued that she has allowed her rulings to be swayed by factors such as ethnicity and race . Sotomayor , a federal appellate judge , would be the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court if her nomination is approved by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate . She would be the 111th person to sit on the nation 's highest court , and the third woman justice . Watch Sotomayor take the oath '' Sotomayor , her foot in a cast from breaking her ankle a week after President Obama nominated her in May , sat impassively as senators detailed a deep divide between majority Democrats and minority Republicans on whether she is the best choice to fill the vacancy left by Justice David Souter 's retirement . In an emotional moment in the beginning of her remarks , Sotomayor singled out her mother , who attended the hearing . `` I am here today because of her aspirations and sacrifices , '' she said . `` Mom , I love that we are sharing this together . '' Watch Sotomayor credit her mother '' The first Supreme Court confirmation hearing of the Obama presidency began Monday with leading Democrats and Republicans signaling a fierce ideological debate over Sotomayor 's qualifications to sit on the high court . It attracted a packed gallery and was disrupted three times by protesters shouting anti-abortion sentiments . Democrats praised Sotomayor 's extensive experience as a judge , which they called the most by any Supreme Court nominee in a century . They insisted her record showed she has been a modest jurist who consistently applied the rule of law . `` Judge Sotomayor 's journey to this hearing room is a truly American story , '' committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said after gaveling the first session to order . `` Let no one demean this extraordinary woman . '' Leahy also ripped conservative `` ideological pressure groups '' for `` distorting '' Sotomayor 's record and opposing a woman who `` will be a justice for all Americans . '' He noted she was first nominated to the federal bench by a Republican president , George H.W. Bush . Watch Leahy praise Sotomayor '' However , Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the committee 's ranking Republican , said Sotomayor represents the kind of activist judge that threatens the traditional foundation of the U.S. legal system . Sessions , a former attorney general in his home state , challenged the attribute of empathy cited by President Obama in nominating Sotomayor . `` Call it empathy , call it prejudice , call it sympathy -- whatever it is , it is not law , '' Sessions said . iReport.com : Share your thoughts on the Sotomayor hearings In particular , Sessions quoted Sotomayor from past speeches in which she said a wise Latina woman should be able to reach a better ruling than a white man , saying it showed an inherent bias . `` I want to be clear : I will not vote for and no senator should vote for an individual nominated by any president who is not fully committed to fairness and impartiality toward every person who appears before them , '' Sessions said . Watch Sessions call Sotomayor nomination `` critical '' '' Other Republicans conceded that Sotomayor was likely to win confirmation because Democrats hold a majority in both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate , but questioned whether her judicial philosophy was for activism or applying the rule of law . `` Unless you have a complete meltdown , you 're going to get confirmed , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said . He described Sotomayor as `` someone of good character , '' but he questioned her `` wise Latina '' comment as a possible indication of bias based on gender or race . Watch Graham tell Sotomayor Republicans are `` unnerved '' by her speeches '' `` If I said anything remotely like that , my career would have been over , '' Graham said , adding that `` it just bothers me when somebody wearing a robe takes the robe off and says their experience makes them better than someone else . '' Democrats called such concern unjustified , saying Sotomayor 's record showed she was fair in applying the law as written . Read about some of Sotomayor 's key rulings '' `` I 'm not sure how many of this panel can sit here today and seriously suggest that she comes to the bench with a personal agenda , '' said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , noting her history showed no pattern of favoritism or bias for anyone . Other Democrats complained that Chief Justice John Roberts , nominated by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005 , has been a conservative activist on the Supreme Court . Find out how Sotomayor compares to current justices '' Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D-Rhode Island , quoted CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin 's statement that `` in every major case since he became the nation 's 17th chief justice , Roberts has sided with the prosecution over the defendant , the state over the condemned , the executive branch over the legislative and the corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff . '' `` And is it a coincidence that this pattern , to continue Toobin 's quote , has served the interests and reflected the values of the contemporary Republican Party ? '' Whitehouse said . `` Some coincidence . '' Three brief outbursts occurred as different Democratic senators gave opening statements . In one , an unidentified man shouted : `` What about the unborn , senator ? Abortion is murder . Stop the genocide of unborn Latinos . '' Another , later in the session , repeatedly shouted : `` Abortion is murder . '' While the nation 's newest senator , Al Franken of Minnesota , made his inaugural committee statement , a woman and man shouted `` you 're wrong '' at his reference to a woman 's reproductive health and rights . The woman , Norma McCorvey , is better known as `` Jane Roe '' from the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade . McCorvey , once a supporter of abortion rights , was the lead plaintiff in the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion . In all three cases , Leahy immediately ordered the protesters removed from the hearing room . Watch protester disrupt hearing '' If history is a guide , Sotomayor appears certain to get Senate approval with mostly Democratic support . When she won Senate confirmation for the federal appellate court in 1998 , there were 29 `` no '' votes , all cast by Republicans .

{"answer":"-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Consumer Reports recently announced its annual used cars ratings , and we were n't surprised to see one of the major categories was `` Best in Fuel Economy . '' With gasoline and oil prices on a seemingly endless upward spiral , that 's a key factor these days when choosing a used car -- or even a new one . The cars that made this list were , according to Consumer Reports , `` the affordable and reliable vehicles -LSB- that -RSB- returned some of the best results in our real-world fuel-economy tests . '' What follows is a list of the vehicles that magazine rated `` Best in Fuel Economy '' in the under $ 10,000 price range , with a short description of each vehicle . The mileage figures stated are the ones calculated by Consumer Reports in their own on-the-road tests . 2000 Honda Insight Overall MPG : 51 When the Insight hit showrooms in 1999 for the 2000 model year , it was hailed as one of the cleanest and most fuel-efficient vehicles in the world . It was the first gasoline-electric hybrid to be sold in the U.S. , and won several design , engineering and technology awards . The Insight employs Honda 's Integrated Motor Assist -LRB- IMA -RRB- system , combining an extremely lightweight 1.0-liter , three-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor . Early models came with a 5-speed manual transmission , but a continuously variable transmission -LRB- CVT -RRB- was offered starting in ' 01 . 2001 - 2002 Toyota Prius Overall MPG : 41 This was one of the earliest generations of the fuel-sipping Prius , and it certainly has become a green living icon since then . Drawing its power from a combination of a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor , these earlier editions generated only 70 hp , but muscle is n't the point in a hybrid car . It 's pod-like design had a certain retro-futuristic appeal , and was roomier than one might think . 2000 - 2005 Toyota Echo Overall MPG : 38 The Echo was rolled out in 2000 as a no-frills compact econo-box , for those who wanted Toyota quality but were on a budget that precluded them from snagging a Corolla . The interior is plain , but the engine is reliable and efficient , and the taut suspension delivers a ride comparable to larger models . This version of the Echo comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder 108-hp 16-Valve EFI engine . 1998 - 2002 Chevrolet Prizm Overall MPG : 32 The Prizm of this era bore some resemblance to the Corolla , since both were built on the same assembly line in a joint GM\/Toyota plant . A front-wheel-drive subcompact sedan , the Prizm was initially rolled out under the Geo nameplate , but later became a Chevy model . Available as a base model and LSi , the Prizm is powered by single twin-cam four-cylinder engines that produced 120 hp in 1998 and 1999 , but the addition of VVT in 2000 boosted the ponies to 125 . 1998 Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 LX Overall MPG : 32 Mazda redesigned the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in 1995 , upgrading it considerably with a more rigid chassis and much-improved ride quality -- not to mention increased interior space . This edition also offers a silkier ride , crisp handling and solid performance for a small car . This model year has a 92-hp 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine , and comes in three trim levels . 1998 - 2000 Toyota Corolla CE\/LE Overall MPG : 32\/31 The Corolla has been a stalwart for more than 40 years , for its quality , dependability and , maybe most importantly , for its fuel economy . The 1998-1999 editions are powered by a 1.8 L , 120-hp , four-cylinder 16-Valve EFI , with aluminum alloy block and head . By 2000 , they 'd tweaked the engine to deliver 125 ponies . A front-wheel drive job , the Corollas of this period come in three trim levels , but Consumer Reports chose the midline CE and top-end LE . 1998 - 2001 Acura Integra LS Overall MPG : 32 The Acura Integra sport coupe and sport sedan lineups have always been standard-bearers for innovative technology , craftsmanship , and exhilarating performance . It was the top-selling automobile in its segment from 1994 - 1998 . It is available on five sport-coupe trim levels and three sport - sedan trims . The Intergra LS came with a 1.8-liter , 140-hp engine , automatic transmission is optional . 2004 - 2005 Scion xA Overall MPG : 31\/30 The Scion xA 's body lines are rounder and more sculpted than the distinctly boxy shape of its xB cousin , but it 's just as well-constructed and just as comfy inside . Low maintenance costs are a big selling point , as is the taut ride . A 1.5-liter , 108-hp 16-valve four-cylinder comes standard on the 2004 - 2005 , along with a five-speed manual transmission , and an automatic transmission was optional .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Josef Fritzl , the Austrian accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children , will plead guilty to rape and incest when his trial opens Monday , Fritzl 's lawyer told CNN . Josef Fritzl is expected to plead guilty to rape and incest on Monday , his lawyer tells CNN . However , Fritzl will deny other charge he faces : murder , enslavement and assault , attorney Rudolph Mayer said Sunday . The 73-year-old expects to spend the rest of his life in prison , Mayer added . Fritzl faces six charges in a closed-door trial . The trial is scheduled to last five days , but Mayer said it could be shorter . Fritzl was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter , Elisabeth , over a 24-year period . But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her , an infant who died soon after birth . State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care . In all , Fritzl is charged with : murder , involvement in slave trade -LRB- slavery -RRB- , rape , incest , assault and deprivation of liberty , Sedlacek 's office said . If convicted , he could face life in prison . Austria does not have the death penalty . `` This man obviously led a double life for 24 years . He had a wife and had seven kids with her . And then he had another family with his daughter , fathered another seven children with her , '' said Franz Polzer , a police officer in Amstetten , the town where Fritzl lived , at the time of his arrest . The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth 's daughter , Kerstin , became seriously ill with convulsions . Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin , then 19 , to be taken to a hospital for treatment . Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police , who discovered the family members in the cellar . Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter , kept her and their children in captivity and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house . Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth . When Elisabeth gained her freedom , she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11 . On August 8 , 1984 , she told police , her father enticed her into the basement , where he drugged her , put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room . Fritzl explained Elisabeth 's disappearance in 1984 by saying the girl , who was then 18 , had run away from home . He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write . Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father 's home in Amstetten , Austria , west of Vienna . The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife ; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep , pretending the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off . Under Austrian law , if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses , he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime . The charges he faces are : \u2022 Murder : The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care , the state prosecutor said . The charge carries a sentence of life in prison . \u2022 Involvement in slave trade : From 1984 until 2008 , prosecutors allege , Fritzl held his daughter , Elisabeth , captive in a dungeon , abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery . If he is convicted , the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison . \u2022 Rape : Between August 30 , 1984 , and June 30 , 1989 , Fritzl `` regularly sexually abused Elisabeth , '' according to the prosecutor . The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison . \u2022 Incest : Parallel to the rape charge . It carries a sentence of up to one year . \u2022 Withdrawal of liberty : Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air , according to prosecutors . That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years . \u2022 Assault : Between August 28 , 1984 , and April 26 , 2006 , Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape , authorities allege . The sentence would range from six months to five years . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen and Melissa Gray contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS , according to a new online tool called the National HIV\/AIDS Atlas . In this map of AIDS prevalence rates in the Southeast , red represents the highest -LRB- 0.593 percent or greater -RRB- . AIDS experts in the region say that access to health care , especially when it comes to screening , is a major problem in rural communities . In the Southeast , people with HIV tend to get tested late , after they have become sick , partly because of stigma , said Kathie Hiers , executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham . `` If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card , the South is the worst , '' she said . With little or no public transportation , people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor , experts say . There is also a shortage of doctors who deal with HIV in the region , Hiers said . These problems also resonate with Georgia 's rural communities , which represent 39 percent of the HIV\/AIDS burden in the state , said Raphael Holloway , director of the HIV Unit at the Georgia Division of Public Health . The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area . `` In some districts , for example , there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services , '' he said . It is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas , he said . Of the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV\/AIDS Atlas , Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence . Although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment , Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007 , behind Texas -LRB- fourth -RRB- , Florida -LRB- third -RRB- , New York -LRB- second -RRB- and California -LRB- first -RRB- , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The Northeast also has a heavy burden of HIV\/AIDS cases nationally , atlas collaborators said . Other states with high numbers of counties with high HIV prevalence included Florida , New York and South Carolina . The atlas , the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties , launched in time for Saturday 's HIV\/AIDS Testing Day . The National Institutes of Health is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for HIV as part of routine health care . `` Not knowing one 's HIV status endangers one 's health and the health of one 's sexual partners . By getting tested for the virus and learning one 's HIV status soon after infection , treatment can begin early , substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life , '' said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health . The National HIV\/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States . The map , a project of the National Minority Quality Forum , encompasses all 50 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands . The more red a region appears , the greater the prevalence , which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time . Users can look at rates of disease by gender , race\/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available . The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS , the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus . They can also zoom into counties and , for New York City only , ZIP codes . About 33 million people have HIV\/AIDS worldwide as of 2007 , according to the World Health Organization . The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006 . Nearly 75 percent of HIV\/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males . People who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated HIV and AIDS are in certain U.S. counties . `` Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S. , '' said Patrick Sullivan , associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University , who collaborated on the atlas . The atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of African-Americans who have HIV and AIDS . `` You can see at the level of the national map that there 's so much variation in the U.S. about which groups have been impacted , '' Sullivan said . Demographics and county-level data are not available for some states , or parts of some states , because of the way these places report data by region , researchers said . These areas appear as gray when users zoom in . Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low . The atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006 , the most recent available . Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available . The atlas , which launched Monday morning , had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon , and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time , said Gary Puckrein , executive director of the atlas project .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Florida prosecutors on Thursday revealed a list of reasons they 're seeking the death penalty against Casey Anthony , who is charged with killing her daughter , Caylee . Under Florida , law , prosecutors need to raise only one of 15 possible aggravating factors to support their decision to seek the death penalty . Assistant State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton cited five circumstances , according to a document obtained by CNN affiliate WESH and other Orlando , Florida , media outlets . In death penalty cases , jurors are asked to weigh aggravating circumstances that make a crime especially heinous against mitigating factors that favor mercy , such as a lack of prior offenses . Among the legal reasons cited : Caylee 's death occurred during aggravated child abuse , was especially `` heinous , atrocious , or cruel , '' and was committed in a `` cold , calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification , '' according to the document . Caylee was also under 12 years old , and Anthony `` stood in a position of familial or custodial authority over her , '' the document states . Karen Levey , the court public information officer , could not confirm that Judge Belvin Perry Jr. received a copy of the notice . As of Thursday evening , defense attorney Jose Baez said he had not been served with the notice . In a hearing this week , Perry ordered the State Attorney 's Office to disclose the aggravating factors they intend to cite in a penalty phase if Anthony is convicted of premeditated murder . Anthony , 24 , is accused of killing 2-year-old Caylee , who disappeared in June 2008 . Her body was found that December in a vacant lot near her grandparents ' home in Orlando . Defense lawyers have said that prosecutors are seeking the death penalty to bankrupt the defense and prevent Anthony from having the attorney of her choice . The defense said that prosecutors had originally said they would not seek death in the case but reversed that position in March 2009 when they learned that Anthony had $ 205,000 for her defense . The bulk of the money came from ABC News for the licensing of photos and videos , Baez testified during a previous hearing . Anthony 's trial is scheduled to begin May 9 , 2011 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson could n't sleep . A coroner preliminarily has concluded Michael Jackson died of an overdose of propofol , court documents say . Maybe it was anxiety over his upcoming comeback concert series in London , England . Perhaps his body was trying to process too many different medications . The reason may never be known , but a sworn affidavit makes clear that the King of Pop could n't get rest the night before he died on June 25 . The affidavit , from Detective Orlando Martinez of the Los Angeles Police Department , outlines probable cause for search warrants on the offices of doctors who are thought to have treated Jackson . Yet it also opens a window into Jackson 's final hours , revealing information about the singer 's treatment and the drugs given him by Dr. Conrad Murray , his personal physician , before his death . Watch a panel discuss Jackson 's death '' Based on interviews , visits to Jackson 's home as well as records and documents gathered during the investigation , the affidavit provides the following account of Jackson 's last days : In May , Jackson hired Murray , a cardiologist . The singer was spending long days rehearsing for concerts that he saw as crucial to reviving his career . For six weeks , Murray told police that he treated Jackson for insomnia . He said he had been giving the singer an intravenous drip with 50 milligrams of propofol , diluted with lidocaine , every night to help him sleep . Jackson was already familiar with propofol , a powerful anesthetic , Murray said . The singer even called it his `` milk '' because of its milky appearance , he said . With the concerts approaching , Jackson started to need these drugs every night , Murray said -- and the doctor said he worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to propofol . He wanted to wean Jackson off the drug . Three days before Jackson 's death -- on June 22 -- Murray gave the singer a combination of drugs that he hoped gradually would move the singer off propofol . That mixture involved propofol , the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam -LRB- known by its brand name , Ativan -RRB- and midazolam -LRB- known as Versed -RRB- . It succeeded in helping Jackson to sleep for that night and the next , Murray said . But by the night of June 24 , Jackson again apparently was unable to sleep . Learn more about the events of Jackson 's final hours '' At 1:30 a.m. on June 25 , Murray decided to forgo the propofol in favor of 10 milligrams of Valium . Half an hour later , with Jackson still awake in bed , Murray injected the singer with two milligrams of lorazepam . It still was n't working . At 3 a.m. , Murray gave the singer two milligrams of midazolam , pushed slowly into his IV . And two hours later , with Jackson still awake , Murray administered another two milligrams of lorazepam through Jackson 's IV . The drugs did nothing to help Jackson sleep . At 7:30 a.m. , Murray gave the singer another two milligrams of midazolam in his IV . By that point , Murray was n't even leaving Jackson 's room anymore , let alone his bedside . The doctor told police he sat next to the singer in his bedroom , monitoring Jackson 's pulse and oxygen levels . More than three hours later , despite a night of medication and doctor 's care , Jackson remained awake . Jackson was repeatedly asking -- even demanding -- that Murray give him more propofol to help him sleep , the doctor told police . So Murray finally administered 25 milligrams of propofol diluted with lidocaine via Jackson 's IV drip . The singer now had his `` milk , '' and it worked . After a restless night , Jackson was finally able to close his eyes and go to sleep . Murray told police he watched Jackson sleep for about 10 minutes before going to the bathroom . It had been a long night for both of them . The trip to the bathroom took less than two minutes , Murray told police . But when he came back , he said , he saw Jackson was n't breathing . He started cardiopulmonary resuscitation , but it did n't work . Jackson was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead later that afternoon . According to court documents released Monday , Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran , the chief medical examiner-coroner for Los Angeles County , concluded Jackson died of an overdose of propofol . Sathyavagiswaran reached that preliminary conclusion after reviewing toxicology results carried out on Jackson 's blood , according to a search warrant and affidavit unsealed in Houston , Texas . The coroner 's office would not comment on the statements in the affidavit . But Ed Chernoff , Murray 's attorney , took issue with some of the information included in the court documents . `` Much of what was in the search warrant affidavit is factual . However , unfortunately , much is police theory , '' Chernoff said , specifically referring to media reports the coroner would rule Jackson 's death a homicide . The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office said it has not yet seen a police report on the case , and no criminal charges have been filed .","question":""}

Deputies saw no physical injuries on Nguyen , who is described on her Twitter page as 4 feet , 11 inches tall and 93 pounds , but she asked to be taken to a hospital , said sheriff 's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell . Watch Caldwell talk about the incident '' The San Diego Chargers linebacker released a statement Sunday noting that no charges had been filed and saying he had done nothing wrong . `` I was concerned about her welfare given the intoxicated state she appeared to be in and I encouraged her to stay until safe transportation could be provided , '' Merriman said . `` I in no way caused any harm to Ms. Nguyen , however , paramedics were called and she was examined but no injuries were reported . '' Merriman said he was looking forward to clearing his name of the `` false accusations . '' Merriman 's lawyer , Todd Macaluso , said Sunday that more than a dozen other people were at the house at the time , and `` witness after witness after witness will back up his story 100 percent . '' In a statement posted on the Chargers ' Web site Sunday , team General Manager A.J. Smith said , `` It is disappointing to hear about the issue involving Shawne Merriman . `` We 'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course , '' Smith said . The 6-foot , 4-inch 265-pounder is entering his fifth year with the Chargers . The team begins its 2009 NFL regular-season campaign September 14 in Oakland , California , for a game against the Raiders . Merriman , a three-time Pro Bowl selection , recorded at least 10 sacks in each of his first three seasons , but he was limited to one game last season because of a knee injury that required surgery .","question":""}
{"answer":"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Vatican said Tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the Catholic Church . The Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church . The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites , Vatican officials said . The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England , forerunner of the Anglican Communion . The parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests , said the Rev. James Massa , ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops . `` This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions , '' Massa said . The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships , said Cardinal William Joseph Levada , the head of the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . Their talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up , Vatican officials said , leading to Tuesday 's announcement . `` The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , '' Levada said . Levada said `` hundreds '' of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church . Among them are 50 Anglican bishops , said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship . While married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests , the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops , Levada said . `` We 've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we 've not anticipated it happening now , '' Di Noia said . `` The Holy Spirit is at work here . '' One interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion , an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide . The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites . The TAC 's primate , Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia , said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican 's announcement `` more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago . '' That is because the Vatican 's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church , said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams , bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America , which is part of the TAC . The Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer , and the TAC 's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does , Williams said . But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably . Williams , who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley , California , said his parishioners have generally been `` very warmly receiving '' Tuesday 's announcement . `` It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience would n't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church , '' Williams said . `` The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray . We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office , in addition to praying for our primate . `` Really , there 'd be very little other difference . '' The parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide `` personal ordinariates '' who would report to the pope , Massa said . Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy , Vatican officials said . The Church of England said the move ends a `` period of uncertainty '' for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church . Both groups have a `` substantial overlap in faith , doctrine and spirituality '' and will continue to hold official dialogues , the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement . `` Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full , visible unity in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic church , '' Levada said . `` At the same time , they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey . '' Preserving Anglican traditions , such as mass rites , adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church , he said . `` The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity , as the history of Christianity shows , '' he said . `` Moreover , the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians : ` There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India racked up a massive first-innings lead of 347 runs over South Africa on the third day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata as V.V.S. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni contributed centuries . The pair put on an unbroken 259 for the seventh wicket , with Laxman unbeaten on 143 and Dhoni on 132 when the declaration came at 643-6 in the final hour of Tuesday 's play . Their efforts meant that four Indians had passed three figures , following Virender Sehwag 's 165 on Monday and Sachin Tendulkar 's 106 , while four South African bowlers conceded more than 100 runs each . South Africa , who will return to the No. 1 Test ranking above India with a draw , reached 6-0 at stumps as only five balls of a scheduled 10 overs were able to be bowled due to bad light . India , who trail 1-0 in the two-match series , resumed the day on 342-5 with Laxman on nine and nightwatchman Amit Mishra on one . They extended their partnership to 48 before paceman Morne Morkel picked up his second wicket as Mishra was caught at second slip by Jacques Kallis , who had earlier dropped the batsman as did captain Graeme Smith . Laxman was dropped by J.P. Duminy on 48 , and India reached lunch at 431-6 before piling on 117 runs in the two hours after the interval . Laxman completed his 15th Test century and Dhoni his fourth in only the second time that four Indian batsmen had reached three figures in the same innings . Meanwhile , New Zealand piled up 553-7 before declaring on the second day of the one-off Test against tourists Bangladesh in Hamilton . Martin Guptill -LRB- 189 -RRB- and Brendon McCullum -LRB- 185 -RRB- extended their sixth-wicket partnership to a national record of 339 .

He put on 79 for the first wicket with Imrul Kayes , who made 28 before edging spinner Daniel Vettori to Ross Taylor at slip .","question":""}
{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Georgia judge threw the book at Brian Nichols on Saturday , giving him four consecutive sentences of life without parole for a 2005 shooting rampage that started in an Atlanta courthouse . Brian Nichols tells the court Saturday in Atlanta , Georgia , `` I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life . '' `` I 'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you . If I could give you more , I would , '' Superior Court Judge James Bodiford told Nichols . Nichols , 37 , was convicted last month of 54 counts for a deadly shooting rampage that began March 11 , 2005 , in the same courthouse where he stood trial . Nichols , who was being tried for rape , shot three people to death as he escaped from the downtown courthouse that day and a federal agent the next day in Atlanta 's Buckhead district before being captured in neighboring Gwinnett County . `` I know that the things that I 've done caused a lot of pain , and I am sorry , '' Nichols , who remained seated , told the court before sentence was pronounced . `` And I just wanted to say that I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life . '' Watch victims ' family members react to the sentence '' Nichols was spared a death sentence Friday after the jury deliberating his fate announced that it could not agree on a sentence . Bodiford gave Nichols the maximum sentence on all the non-murder charges , and ordered them to be served consecutively . Those terms ranged from five years for escape to life for armed robbery . Other charges included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , robbery by force , theft by taking , hijacking a motor vehicle and false imprisonment . `` It 's a large number of years . It 's many lifetimes , '' Bodiford said . Bodiford ordered that Nichols serve his time in the Georgia state penal system , forgoing the possibility of sending him to the federal maximum-security prison in Colorado . Bodiford implored Nichols ' family and attorneys never to trust Nichols again . `` There 's ample evidence that trusting him will get you killed , '' he said in concluding the sentencing hearing . Jurors told Bodiford on Friday night that they were deadlocked , with nine in favor of death and three in favor of life without parole . Under Georgia law , the jurors must reach a unanimous decision in order to impose a death sentence . In the absence of a unanimous jury verdict , the decision fell in the hands of Bodiford . Defense lawyers said Nichols , who confessed to the killings , suffers from a mental disorder . The jurors unanimously found the necessary aggravating circumstances in the four murders , but they were split over the death penalty . After nine weeks of testimony , the jury found Nichols guilty of 54 counts , which included the four murders plus numerous aggravated assaults , carjackings and kidnappings . The shootings began in the Fulton County Courthouse , where Nichols was set to stand trial for rape . He overpowered a sheriff 's deputy and took her gun before proceeding to the courtroom of Judge Rowland Barnes , killing him and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau . Sgt. Hoyt Teasley chased Nichols to outside the courthouse , where Nichols fatally shot him . Nichols killed off-duty U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm as he worked on a house in Buckhead the next day . He was captured later that day after a standoff with police in the apartment of a woman he had taken hostage in Gwinnett County . The case drew nationwide attention , in part because of the cost of Nichols ' representation : about $ 2 million at last accounting . Nichols had attempted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence , but the Fulton County District Attorney 's Office would not take the death penalty off the table .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The average cost of medical care for a premature or low birth-weight baby for its first year of life is about $ 49,000 , according to a new report from the March of Dimes Foundation . Babies born after the 37th week of pregnancy are less costly to the health care system than premature babies . By contrast , a newborn without complications costs $ 4,551 for care in its first year of life , the report said . Newborns with other kinds of complications , such as congenital defects , have medical expenses of $ 10,273 on average in the first year . The foundation wants to show employers the importance of good maternity care , maternity coverage , and prevention of prematurity , said Jennifer Howse , president of the March of Dimes , a nonprofit for pregnancy and baby health . `` It 's in the best interest of the bottom line for the employer , and of course it 's certainly in the best interest for the baby , the employee , and ultimately the community in which the business is located , '' she said . Although most of these costs go straight to the health care plans , even out-of-pocket expenses are far greater for premature babies than for children delivered at a normal time . The average out-of-pocket expense for a premature or low-birth-weight baby in the first year was $ 1,987 . For uncomplicated births , it is $ 654 , and a baby with other kinds of complications averages $ 953 in out of pocket expenses . But it 's important to note that these are average costs for premature babies born at different times -- a baby born closer to 40 weeks will most likely cost much less than a baby born at 26 weeks , said William Sexson , neonatologist at Emory University and prematurity prevention chair for the March of Dimes for the state of Georgia . Sexson was not involved in the new report . The problem of prematurity By definition , a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy . About 12 percent of all pregnancies in the United States result in premature birth , according to the National Institutes of Health . A low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 2,500 grams , or 5.5 pounds . Prematurity may contribute to problems such as cerebral palsy , vision problems , learning disabilities , and developmental delays , experts say . The rate of premature babies in the United States has increased 36 percent since the early 1980s , the March of Dimes said . One reason for the abundance of premature births may be the increasing number of elective early deliveries , said Sexson . There is a lack of transparency about both patients ' and obstetricians ' decisions to , for example , have a Caesarean section close to term -- technically premature . The March of Dimes recommends every elective delivery before 39 weeks be reviewed . `` There is a real concern that many of those deliveries are a lot more elective than they ought to be , '' Sexson said . Uncomplicated Caesarean deliveries cost over 40 percent more than uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , the new report said . These deliveries also resulted in longer inpatient stays , outpatient visits , and more prescriptions filled . Most of the costs get covered by a health plan -- out-of-pocket expenses were similar for normal Caesarian deliveries , uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , and complicated births . Preventing premature births Prenatal care is essential in helping mothers carry their babies to term , experts say . The vitamin folate is especially important for mothers-to-be because it has been shown to prevent congenital abnormalities , said Janet Larson , chief of neonatology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Premature babies cost the United States at least $ 26 billion each year , according to the Institute of Medicine . Women who have a shortened cervix , or have certain infections , such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis , are at higher risk for having a premature baby , according to the NIH . A history of giving birth to premature babies is also a risk factor , said Dr. Charles Macri , obstetrician-gynecologist at the The George Washington University Hospital in Washington . A woman in this situation may take progesterone therapy between weeks 16 and 36 to decrease the likelihood of a premature delivery . A pregnant woman should always tell her doctor if she has had any kind of cervical surgery , which may also contribute to premature births , he said . Women who carry multiples babies at once , even twins , are also at higher risk of giving birth prematurely , he said . Not all premature births can be prevented , however . Some babies are `` destined to be born early , '' Macri said . About 50 percent of pregnancies that result in premature births are completely normal until labor , Sexson said . Costs for premature and low-birth-weight babies are also higher in terms of combined medical costs for the mother and child -- $ 64,713 , compared with $ 15,047 for uncomplicated births , the March of Dimes report said . Even in tough economic times , experts agree that pregnant women should not cut back on health care . `` Investing in health care costs -- that 's the best investment a family can make , '' Howse said .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -- Malaria is one of the world 's worst health problems and one of its biggest killers , with half a billion people affected every year , according to the Roll Back Malaria partnership . Around half a billion people are infected with malaria every year . Ninety percent of those cases are in Africa . Saturday marks World Malaria Day , when the world commemorates global efforts to eradicate the disease . Below CNN 's Vital Signs has produced a complete A - Z guide to how malaria spreads , the symptoms to look out for and how to protect yourself . A is for Anti-malarial drugs The history of anti-malarial medicine has been marked by a constant struggle between evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drugs . Currently , anti-malaria experts are focusing on therapies that combine several drugs for better effects . B is for Blood stream Once a mosquito has bitten and the malaria parasites reach the liver , the parasites divide and create thousands of mature parasites . These are released into the blood and infect red blood cells . At that point , typical malaria symptoms such as fever and anemia develop . C is for Chloroquine Until recently , Chloroquine , an anti-malarial drug , was the first option for many people because of its relatively low price and effectiveness . However , resistance to Chloroquine in many parts of the world has rendered the drug ineffective . D is for Diagnosis After noting your symptoms and travel history , your doctor will likely obtain a sample of your blood for observation . Two blood samples , taken at six - and 12-hour intervals , can usually confirm the presence of the malaria parasite and its type . It is possible to be infected by more than one parasite at the same time . E is for Epidemic According to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , large and devastating epidemics can occur when the mosquito-borne parasite is introduced into areas where people have had little prior contact with the infecting parasite . These epidemics can be triggered by wet weather conditions and further aggravated by floods or mass population movements driven by conflict . F is for Fever The most common symptom of all types of malarias is high fever , which is why doctors often misdiagnose malaria for flu . The fever is a reaction to toxins in the blood . It is therefore advised to tell your doctor you have been to a malaria affected zone , even if symptoms arise months after the trip . G is for Genome In 2002 , -- hundred years after it was discovered that mosquitoes transmit the malaria parasite -- the complete genetic codes of both the human malaria parasite and the mosquito that spreads it was cracked . This development brought scientists a step closer to developing drugs and vaccines to fight the disease , Nature magazine reported . H is for Hotspots Most cases and deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa , many of them occurring among children . However , Asia , Latin America , the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected . In 2006 , malaria was present in 109 countries and territories . I is for Immunity Travelers from malaria-free regions such as Europe and the United States , with little or no immunity , who go to areas with high disease rates , are particularly vulnerable . It is essential to take precautions by taking anti-malarial drugs prescribed by your doctor . J is for Julius Wagner-Jauregg Julius Wagner-Jauregg , a Viennese doctor , was the first to intentionally infect syphilis patients with malaria parasites . By controlling the subsequent malaria-related fever with an anti-malaria drug , the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized . Jauregg received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927 . K is for Killer Malaria is a life-threatening disease but it is preventable and curable if the right steps are taken . Education in recognizing the symptoms has reduced the number of cases in some areas by 20 percent . Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming a killer . L is for Laser gun U.S. scientists say they are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes . The laser fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of wings , the lead scientist on the project told CNN . The project is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . M is for Mosquitoes Malaria is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquitoes . The mosquitoes bite between sunset and sunrise and parasites from the mosquito are then injected into the person 's skin and transported to the liver . About 170 species of such parasites exist , but only four cause malaria in humans . N is for Nets The distribution of mosquito nets with insecticide is a very effective method of malaria prevention , and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods . These nets can often be obtained for around $ 3 . Earlier this month , actor Ashton Kutcher won a Twitter race against CNN to reach 1 million followers . Kutcher had pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to charity if he beat CNN , and 1,000 if he lost . CNN agreed to do the same . O is for Obstacles In many endemic areas , access to health facilities , as well as drug costs , still present major obstacles . Humanitarian agency Medecins Sans Frontieres estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between $ 0.25 and $ 2.40 per dose in 2002 . P is for Pandemic For malaria to become a pandemic -LRB- plague -RRB- in an area , several factors have to be present : high human population density ; high mosquito population density ; high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans . Q is for Quinine Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria in the 17th century . Since the 1940 's , many other anti-malarial drugs have appeared on the market and have taken precedent over quinine . But quinine is still being used to treat malaria in some cases . R is for Repellent The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says inspect repellents with DEET -LRB- most common active ingredient in strong insecticides -RRB- in them should be used on exposed skin and flying-insect spray can be used to kill mosquitoes in the sleeping area . DEET may be toxic , however and should be used with care . S is for Symptoms Fever is not the only symptom of malaria . Other symptoms can include shivers , headaches and nausea . Sweating and exhaustion is also common and in some cases , it can affect the brain or kidneys . T is for Tablets Malarone is a common anti-malaria drug among many travelers . It is said to have a 97 percent efficacy with relatively few side-effects . It can be given just one day before arrival in a malaria endemic country and only needs to be taken for another week after leaving . U is for Unborn child According to the WHO , pregnant women are at high risk of contracting malaria . The illness can result in high rates of miscarriages and cause more than 10 percent of maternal deaths annually . This figure can rise to 50 percent in cases of severe disease . V is for Vaccine Despite intensive research , no effective malaria vaccine has been developed to date . But according to a report in April 's New Scientist journal , a unique vaccine taken from the saliva of infected mosquitoes has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be tested in people . W is for World Malaria Day April 25 has become World Malaria Day to provide a global effort to control malaria around the world . The international malaria community only has two years left to meet the 2010 targets of delivering effective protection and treatment to all people at risk of malaria , as called for by the UN Secretary-General , Ban Ki-Moon . X is for X-ray X-ray microscopes are used to find the presence of malaria in red blood cells and see how they interact with healthy cells . One of the advantages of this type of microscope is that it produces very-high-resolution images of the cell structure . Y is for Yellow fever Yellow fever is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes . Some countries , such as Peru , require a certificate showing yellow-fever vaccination before you can travel there . Z is for Zanzibar Zanzibar , part of the African republic of Tanzania , has had relative successes in combating malaria ; Africa 's biggest killer according to the New Scientist journal . The achievements are due to the widespread use of treated bed nets , along with the switch to new anti-malarial drugs instead of Chloroquine in 2004 .","question":""}

The sex of the mostly hairless , pink newborn , which was born around 5 a.m. , is not known yet , said Dr. Ron Swaisgood of the zoo 's Institute of Conservation Research . It will take about one month for the iconic black-and-white coloration of the giant panda to become visible , Swaisgood said . Its mother , Bai Yun , will care for the newborn by herself until she starts leaving the den regularly , at which time members of the zoo 's giant panda team will step in briefly to check on the cub , he said . `` She is a very experienced mother . She raised all of her other cubs until about 1.5 years , the natural age for separation , '' Swaisgood told CNN Radio . `` She 's a real pro . '' Weighing in around 300 pounds , Bai Yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub , who weighs around 4 ounces. , the typical size of a baby panda , Swaisgood said . `` Pandas give birth to what 's called very ` altricial ' cubs . That means they are very small and fragile . This cub would probably weigh about 4 ounces . It would be pink and hairless and completely dependent on the mother , '' he said . The birth is considered a success for the zoo 's Institute for Conservation Research , which works with research and breeding centers around the world to boost the endangered panda population Herself a model of that effort , Bai Yun was the first panda to be born and survive at the breeding center of the China Center for Research and Conservation of the Giant Panda in the Wolong Nature Reserve in 1991 . She has given birth to four other cubs since arriving at the San Diego Zoo in 1996 from China . Two of them have since been returned to China , Swaisgood said . The newborn 's father , Gao Gao , is a wild-born giant panda that arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 2003 from the Wolong Nature Reserve . He will not be involved in raising the cub . The cub will remain in the den with its mother for a few months and gradually start to come out as soon as it is able to walk , Swaisgood said . In four to five months , the cub will be ready for the public , Swaisgood said . Until then , the public can view live video of the cub and its mother on the zoo 's Web site . `` This highly endangered species still requires a lot of attention and assistance , but there is hope for the future , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Militants set fire to a hotel at Pakistan 's only ski resort Thursday , as security in the Swat Valley continued to deteriorate despite a month-old peace deal . Pakistani soldiers on patrol in the Swat Valley , which is home to the country 's only ski resort . Militants forced their way into the state-run hotel in the northwestern tourist valley early Thursday morning , ransacked it and set it on fire , said Sardar Rehim Shahzad , district coordinator for Swat police . The hotel , the only one at the Malam Jabba ski resort , sustained significant damage , he told CNN . The resort is located near the Afghanistan border and about 300km -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- from the capital city of Islamabad . It was shut down last summer after militants overran the area , keeping tourists away , Shahzad said . Swat Valley , located in North West Frontier Province -LRB- NWFP -RRB- , was once Pakistan 's biggest tourist destination . Aside from the ski resort , it was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area . In recent months , however , militants bent on imposing fundamentalist Islamic law , or Sharia , have unleashed a wave of violence across the NWFP which has claimed hundreds of lives , many of them security personnel . The militants want women to wear veils , beards for men and to ban music and television . After months of bloody battles , the government in May reached a peace deal with fighters loyal to the banned hardline Islamic group , Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi -LRB- TNSM -RRB- . It is the latest attempt by Pakistan 's new government -- headed by the party of the assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto -- to achieve peace through negotiations in the lawless tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein . Ahead of the peace pact , Pakistan 's government released TNSM 's former leader Sufi Mohammed , who had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan . He was freed after agreeing to cooperate with the government . Under the terms of his release , TNSM was also expected to lay down its arms and forgo violence . But his son-in-law Fazlullah , who took over TNSM during his jail stint , vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tiger Woods has canceled plans to attend his own golf tournament in southern California because of injuries he suffered near his Florida home early Friday , the pro golfer said in a statement Monday . `` I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week , '' Woods said of the Chevron World Challenge in Thousand Oaks , California . `` I am certain it will be an outstanding event and I 'm very sorry that I ca n't be there . '' He also canceled a Tuesday news conference for the start of the tournament , which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs . Woods suffered minor injuries in a vehicle accident early Friday in his luxury neighborhood near Orlando , Florida , according to a police accident report . State police in Florida said Monday an investigation of the single-vehicle crash `` is ongoing and charges are pending . '' The incident has ended Woods ' golf appearances until next season , according to a statement posted on his Web site . `` Woods will not participate in any other tournaments in 2009 and will return to action next year , '' the statement said . The PGA Tour has ended for the year , but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away . At least one other charity event is scheduled , but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend . The Chevron World Challenge will go on despite the absence of its host , said Greg McLaughlin , president of Woods ' foundation . `` We support Tiger 's decision and are confident the strong field and excellent course will provide an exciting week of competition at the Chevron World Challenge , '' McLaughlin said . In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site , Woods offered no details of his wreck except to say he had cuts and bruises and was `` pretty sore . '' `` This situation is my fault , and it 's obviously embarrassing to my family and me , '' he said . `` I 'm human and I 'm not perfect . I will certainly make sure this does n't happen again . '' According to a police report , Woods pulled out of his driveway about 2:25 a.m. Friday in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant , then a tree . Authorities have said they do n't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour , but a police report said the wreck was not alcohol-related . State troopers have unsuccessfully asked three times to question him about the wreck , police said . Woods canceled the third scheduled interview on Sunday , Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Montes told CNN . `` We have been informed by the Florida Highway Patrol that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional , '' said Woods ' agent Mark Steinberg , in a written statement . `` Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity , it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family . '' Under Florida law , Woods must show his license , registration and proof of insurance to police , but is not obligated to give a statement on the crash . His attorney Mark NeJame handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods ' home , Montes said . Opinion : Tiger Woods is only human NeJame told CNN he stood by Woods ' statement and had no further comment . `` If we 're unable to meet with him , we 'll move on with our investigation , '' Montes said . But she called the delays `` very unusual , because it 's such a minor accident . '' Profile : Tiger Woods Last week , a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess . The Associated Press contacted the woman and reported she denied having an affair with Woods . The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times , as well as three U.S. Open Championships .

{"answer":"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens , dignitaries and politicians . South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday . The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament , with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers . The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim , who died Tuesday of a heart failure . Kim 's age at the time of his death was in dispute , with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83 . Kim 's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said . Another president , Park Chung-hee , was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979 . Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea . The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953 . But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor , Roh Moo-hyun . Ahead of the funeral , President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation , who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries . Lee , in turn , reiterated his government 's firm stance , presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan was quoted as saying by Yonhap . But in a possible sign that icy relations between the two rival nations are nevertheless thawing , South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday . It was the first high-level , cross-border contact in nearly two years . The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year . Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan . The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters . South Korea condemned the action , calling the launches `` provocative '' and `` unwise . '' CNN 's Jake Perez contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Art Linkletter , the easygoing , smooth-voiced emcee famed for his long-running hosting gigs of the radio and television shows `` House Party '' and `` People Are Funny , '' and author of `` Kids Say the Darndest Things , '' has died , according to his spokeswoman . Linkletter `` died peacefully at home with his family on Wednesday , '' a statement from the family said . He was 97 . `` Just one month earlier , while being honored at an event , he was asked what he considered his greatest life accomplishment , '' the statement said . `` He responded ' Family . ' '' Linkletter rose to fame as a radio announcer in San Diego , later becoming a program director . In 1944 , he launched `` Art Linkletter 's House Party , '' a daytime CBS radio show that moved to television in 1952 and ran until 1969 . `` Kids say the darndest things , '' was Linkletter 's often-repeated phrase because of his humorous interviews with children . It became the title of his best-selling book , a country music hit and was reprised by Bill Cosby as a 1998 TV show . The phrase began as a segment on `` House Party . '' Linkletter would ask several children their thoughts on various topics ; their responses were often hilariously absurd . `` I was Oprah before there was Oprah , '' he once told The Wall Street Journal . Flowers were placed on Linkletter 's star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame Wednesday afternoon . His nighttime show , `` People Are Funny , '' started on radio in 1942 and ran on NBC television from 1954 to 1961 . According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh 's `` The Complete Directory to Primetime Network and Cable Shows , 1946-Present , '' the show featured everyday guests who would be interviewed by Linkletter and then asked to do a stunt . The result for those who failed at the stunt was often a pie in the face or being splashed by water . Linkletter also hosted a short-lived quiz show , `` The Art Linkletter Show , '' in 1963 . At its height , Linkletter 's fame was notable enough to make him part of Milton Bradley 's `` Game of Life , '' which featured Linkletter 's endorsement and his photo on the game 's $ 100,000 bill . His 1960 biography was called `` Confessions of a Happy Man . '' But the host 's own life was touched by a famous tragedy . In 1969 , his daughter Diane -- just 20 at the time -- jumped to her death from a sixth-floor apartment in Hollywood . Linkletter blamed the death on LSD , though the drug use was never confirmed . Linkletter became an ardent anti-drug crusader , releasing a hit record , `` We Love You , Call Collect , '' which won a Grammy Award . Of his five children , two others also predeceased Linkletter : son Robert died in a 1980 auto accident , and another son , Jack , died of lymphoma in 2007 . Linkletter is survived by his wife of 75 years , Lois , and two daughters , Dawn Griffin and Sharon Linkletter . Linkletter was born Gordon Arthur Kelly in Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , on July 17 , 1912 . Orphaned as an infant , he was adopted by traveling evangelist John Linkletter and his wife , Mary . After a short stint on Wall Street -- he was a typist at an investment bank at the time of the 1929 Crash , he told the WSJ -- he eventually moved to San Diego and attended college at San Diego State University . While in college , he took a job as a staff announcer at CBS affiliate KGB-AM . Linkletter was an astute businessman . The owner of Linkletter Enterprises , he owned millions of acres in Australia and was a sheep and cattle rancher . He also owned oil wells and was a spokesman for several products .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three U.S. Navy SEALs face criminal charges after the alleged mastermind of one of the most notorious crimes against Americans in Iraq accused them of punching him after his capture , the military said Wednesday . Ahmed Hashim Abed -- thought to be behind the slayings and mutilation of four U.S. contractors in Falluja in 2004 and captured in summer -- made the accusations against the three servicemen , said Lt. Col. Holly Silkman , a spokeswoman for U.S. Central Command . A civilian lawyer for one of three SEALs said his client and the other SEALs declined a nonjudicial resolution to the case , a step sometimes called a `` captain 's mast . '' The servicemen say they did not harm the detainee in any way and they want their names cleared in a court-martial so they can continue their careers in the Navy , said the attorney , Neil Puckett . Because the charges against Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe , Petty Officer Jonathan Keefe and Petty Officer Julio Heurtas are the military equivalent of misdemeanors , they will go before a special court-martial , which is for less serious offenses than those heard in a general court-martial . If found guilty , they could be sentenced to a maximum of a year in a military prison , demotion to the lowest Navy rank , a cut in pay and a bad conduct discharge . But if found innocent of all charges , they would be able to continue their careers with no record of the case in their personnel files . The three SEALs are with their unit in Norfolk , Virginia . They will make an initial appearance before a military judge on December 7 . The court-martial is scheduled to begin in January . The attorney said he expects the SEALs will not waive their constitutional right to confront the accuser in court , which could cause a logistical challenge . Abed is believed to be in a U.S. military detention center overseas , and it is unclear if the military would want him brought to the United States for the court-martial . The four contractors , one of whom was a former Navy SEAL , were working for the Blackwater company when they were attacked in Falluja in 2004 . After they were killed with hand grenades and rifles , their bodies were set on fire and dragged through the streets . The bodies of two of them were hung from a bridge in Falluja , an image that was broadcast around the world . Four days after the attack , the U.S. Marines launched a major offensive inside Falluja , in part to help find the killers .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Texas child welfare officials have asked a judge to order a teenage member of a polygamous sect to let them take DNA from her infant so they can determine the father 's identity , according to court documents filed in the case . An aerial view taken last year shows some living quarters at polygamist leader Warren Jeffs ' Texas ranch . The teenager , who is younger than 18 , is a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . She is believed to have had the baby in June , Texas Department of Family and Protective Services attorneys said in the documents , filed earlier this month . Child welfare authorities also believe the teenager was married at 14 to an adult male , department attorney John Dolezal writes in the motion . `` In order to determine the identity of the sexual perpetrator who engaged in sexual intercourse with -LSB- the girl -RSB- while she was a minor , which act consequently led to this pregnancy , the department is required to perform genetic testing on the child so as to determine who that individual is , '' the motion said . CNN is not naming the teenager , as authorities allege she is a victim of sexual abuse . A hearing on the matter was conducted Tuesday . Patrick Crimmins , spokesman for DFPS , said the teenager showed up without the baby . An agreement was reached by both sides during the hearing , Crimmins said , but the judge ordered that the agreement not be made public . The department has attempted to resolve the issue with the teenager but had not been successful , the motion said . The FLDS was thrust into the spotlight in April , when child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado , Texas , citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse . Following a court battle , the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned , saying there was no evidence they faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch . Critics of the FLDS say the sect forces girls into marriage with men . To date , 12 FLDS members have been indicted on charges including sexual assault of a minor , conducting unlawful marriages involving a minor and bigamy as part of an ongoing investigation , according to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott 's office . They include Warren Jeffs , the FLDS leader and `` prophet . '' Jeffs was already facing charges of sexual assault of a child in Texas , which carries a sentence of up to life upon conviction , when he was indicted earlier this month on a first-degree felony count of aggravated sexual assault . He is also facing a sentence of up to life in Utah , where he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old . He is awaiting trial in Arizona , where he faces similar charges . The FLDS is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church . It openly practices polygamy on the ranch , as well as in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona border .","question":""}
{"answer":"Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistan 's military said Tuesday that its forces have taken over a Taliban stronghold during the ongoing ground offensive in the tribal region of South Waziristan . Pakistani security forces have secured Sararogha and have started to clear the town of weapons and ammunition , the military said . It comes a day after its forces gained control of Kaniguram , another key Taliban stronghold , which the military says its forces have now completely secured . According to the military , 21 militants and one Pakistani soldier died in the past 24 hours of fighting -- most of them in the raid on Sararogha . The military is trying to rout Taliban insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border . The restive and largely ungoverned region of South Waziristan is the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban . Pakistan 's military suspects its leader , Hakimullah Mehsud , is still in the region backed by up to 8,000 militant fighters . Pakistan 's army has launched three similar offensives in Kaniguram and Sararogha since 2004 without success , sometimes agreeing to peace deals that eventually fall apart . Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas recently told CNN that this time a peace deal is not an option . `` Certainly there is no scope of a peace deal , '' Abbas told CNN . `` It is a fight to the finish . '' The military began its ground offensive in South Waziristan three weeks ago , however the region has been affected by a broader anti-Taliban offensive that has uprooted more than 180,000 people this year , according to the United Nations . Many of those people -- more than 94,000 -- have fled South Waziristan since June , the U.N. said last week . In recent weeks , Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against the military campaign . On Monday , the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi were hit by separate suicide bombings . A suicide attacker believed to be on a motorcycle targeted people outside a bank in Rawalpindi who were lined up to pick up their monthly checks , police said . That attack killed 30 people , police said on Tuesday . The attack happened in the Cannt area of Rawalpindi , close to Pakistan 's military headquarters where the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , was meeting with Pakistan 's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Monday . It was unclear if he was there at the time of the attack . Hours later , two suicide bombers detonated their explosives at a police checkpoint in Lahore , injuring 17 police and civilians .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sachin Tendulkar confirmed his status as one of cricket 's all-time great batsmen on Wednesday , adding the highest individual one-day international score to his list of world records . The 36-year-old became the first player to score a double-century in the 50-over format as India thrashed South Africa by 153 runs in the second match of the series in Gwalior to take an unassailable 2-0 lead . Tendulkar surpassed the previous record of 194 , which was jointly held by Pakistan 's Saeed Anwar and Charles Coventry of Zimbabwe , to take his record total of runs to 17,598 in 442 one-day internationals played . He passed three figures for the 46th time , and has now scored 17 more one-day centuries than his closest rival Ricky Ponting of Australia . Tendulkar , one of India 's most popular sporting heroes , also holds the records for most runs and most centuries in the five-day Test format . `` I do n't know how to react to this , '' he told reporters after being presented with a silver bat to mark his 20 years in the sport . `` I would like to dedicate this double hundred to all the people of India who stood with me for the last 20 years . I really appreciate their support . This is for all the people in India . '' Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hailed his teammate , with whom he added an unbroken 101 at breakneck pace . `` Even when he 's tired and ca n't play the big shots , he 's very clever to use the pace of the bowler , '' Dhoni said . `` It 's very difficult for the bowlers , they do n't know exactly where to bowl , so I think he batted really well . '' Tendulkar made only four in India 's victory in the first match on Sunday , but batted throughout the home team 's innings of 401-3 as he made exactly 200 . Tendulkar put on 194 for the second wicket with Dinesh Karthik after the early departure of Virender Sehwag for nine with the score on 25 . Tendulkar scorched to his 50 from only 37 deliveries before Karthik became Wayne Parnell 's second victim , having made 79 off 85 balls with three sixes . Yusuf Pathan matched Tendulkar 's ferocious scoring rate as he clubbed 36 off 23 deliveries , adding 81 with the man known as `` the Little Master .

As well as three sixes , he hit 25 boundaries -- the most in any individual one-day innings -- in his 147-ball knock . South Africa set the record for highest run chase of 438-9 against Australia in 2006 , and needed to score the third biggest mark to overhaul India 's total . But the tourists did not get close , being dismissed for 248 with 7.1 overs left in their allocation . A.B.

{"answer":"Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The sound of taps echoed across the Texas plains Tuesday after President Obama pledged that the work of those killed in last week 's Fort Hood massacre will go on despite their `` incomprehensible '' slayings . Speaking to an estimated 15,000 people at a memorial service at the post , Obama vowed that justice will be done in the attack that left 13 dead and 42 wounded . Though he told the families that `` no words can fill the void that has been left , '' he added , `` your loved ones endure through the life of our nation . '' `` Their life 's work is our security and the freedom that we too often take for granted . Every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town ; every dawn that a flag is unfurled ; every moment that an American enjoys life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is their legacy , '' the president said . After his remarks , Obama and first lady Michelle Obama laid a presidential coin before each of the 13 battlefield crosses -- the helmet , boots and rifle representing each of those killed -- before family members and comrades filed past . Fort Hood Army Post has seen 545 soldiers killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , said Lt. Gen. Robert Cone , the post 's commander , `` but never did we expect to pay such a high price at home . '' Gen. George Casey , the Army 's chief of staff , added , `` Grieve with us . Do n't grieve for us . '' `` Those who have fallen did so in the service of their country , '' he said . `` They freely answered the call to serve , and they gave their lives for something that they loved and believed in . '' Obama called the wartime killings of American troops on their home soil `` incomprehensible . '' But he said the values the dead volunteered to defend will live on and will be extended even to the man accused of carrying to the slayings . The suspected gunman in the attack is a 39-year-old Army psychiatrist , Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , who remained in intensive care at an Army hospital in San Antonio , Texas . Hasan , an American-born Muslim of Palestinian descent , was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan but had told his family that he wanted to get out of the military . `` No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts , '' Obama said at the memorial service . But he said soldiers who responded to the attack `` remind us of who we are as Americans . '' `` We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman and give him due process , just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes , '' he said . No charges have been filed , and authorities have not identified a motive in Thursday 's attack . But in a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation `` indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . '' Thursday 's victims included 12 soldiers and a retired soldier working as a civilian physician 's assistant . Shortly before the ceremony and 1,200 miles away , the remains of one of the soldiers was carried off a chartered jet in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . An honor guard met the casket of Sgt. Amy Krueger on the apron at General Mitchell International Airport . Krueger , 29 , was a high school athlete who joined the military after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington .

{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's father suspects his son was murdered and that Dr. Conrad Murray is `` just a fall guy '' in a conspiracy . Joe Jackson appeared on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' on Monday night , just hours after sitting in a courtroom to hear Murray plead not guilty to a single charge of involuntary manslaughter in his son 's death last summer . A Los Angeles judge set bail at $ 75,000 , despite arguments from the prosecutor that Murray is a flight risk and needs a higher bail . Murray posted the bond and was released several hours later . Michael Jackson 's family , including his parents , four of his brothers and one sister , filled the first two rows of the small courtroom . `` I was looking for justice , and justice , to me , would be a murder charge , '' Joe Jackson told King . Prosecutors charged Murray , who was Jackson 's personal physician , with causing the pop star 's death `` without malice '' by acting `` without due caution and circumspection . '' Murray was with the pop star when he died on June 25 , 2009 . The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson 's death a homicide , resulting from a combination of drugs , primarily propofol -- a powerful anesthesia -- and lorazepam . Joe Jackson suggested it was more than a doctor making a fatal judgment . `` To me , he 's just a fall guy , '' Jackson said . `` There 's other people , I think , involved with this whole thing . But I think that he 's interrogated -- he would come clean and tell everything he knows . '' He said Michael Jackson told his mother , as he was preparing for his comeback concerts in London , England , last year , that he thought he would be killed . `` He was afraid to even do all of these shows , because he was afraid that he would n't get a chance to finish all of the show , '' Joe Jackson said . `` He could n't do all those shows back-to-back . Even his kids say that he had told them that he would be murdered . '' Murray turned himself in shortly before 4 p.m. at a branch courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport . He pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing before Judge Keith L. Schwartz . The judge refused to suspend Murray 's medical license as a term of his bond , but he did order him not to use any anesthesia on patients . `` I do n't want you sedating people , '' Schwartz told Murray . Read the criminal complaint The involuntary manslaughter charge means that Murray caused Jackson 's death by acting `` without due caution and circumspection . '' If convicted , Murray would face a maximum four-year prison sentence , according to prosecutors . More on involuntary manslaughter Jackson family members later reacted to what they saw in the courtroom : `` Not enough , '' Jermaine Jackson said when asked what he thought of the charge . `` I do n't like what happened , '' Joe Jackson said as he left the courthouse . La Toya Jackson later issued a statement through a publicist . `` Michael was murdered and although he died at the hands of Dr. Conrad Murray , I believe Dr. Murray was a part of a much larger plan , '' her statement said . `` There are other individuals involved and I will not rest and I will continue to fight until all of the proper individuals are brought forth and justice is served . '' Her statement did not elaborate on what she meant in her reference to `` a much larger plan . '' Murray traveled to Los Angeles at the end of January from his home in Houston , Texas , in expectation of possible charges , his lawyer said . He used part of his time last week to visit the pop star 's resting place in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , California . Murray , a cardiologist , was hired as Jackson 's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for comeback concerts in London , England . The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson at his $ 100,000-a-month rented Holmby Hills mansion through the early morning hours of June 25 , 2009 , in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep , according to a police affidavit . He administered sleep aids , and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours , Murray said , he left the bedroom for `` about two minutes maximum , '' the affidavit says . `` Upon his return , Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing , '' it says . The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him to UCLA Medical Center . Efforts at CPR proved fruitless , and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. . The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson 's death a homicide , resulting from a combination of drugs , primarily propofol and lorazepam . The coroner 's statement said Jackson died from `` acute propofol intoxication , '' but there were `` other conditions contributing to death : benzodiazepine effect . '' Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines . The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing , a police affidavit said . Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer 's death . The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol , the generic name for Diprivan , diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip . The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it . During the two nights before Jackson 's death , Murray said , he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep . The full autopsy report , which was released Monday afternoon , included an analysis by an anesthesiology consultant of the use of propofol . The consultant , Dr. Selma Calmes , concluded that the `` standard of care for administering propofol was not met . '' `` There was no evidence of an infusion pump for control of an IV infusion . No monitors were found at the scene ; a blood pressure cuff and portable pulse oximeter were recovered from a closet in the next room , '' Calmes wrote . An oxygen tank was found near where Jackson slept , but it was empty when the coroner investigator checked it two weeks after Jackson died , Calmes said . `` Multiple opened bottles of propofol were found with small amounts of remaining drugs , '' Calmes said . `` A used bottle should be discarded six hours after opening , to avoid possible bacterial growth . '' `` The level of propofol found on toxicology exam are similar to those found during general anesthesia for major surgery , '' Calmes said . During such surgery , any patient would be `` intubated and ventilated by an anesthesiologist , '' she said . The consultant 's report said that the level of lorazepam found in Jackson `` would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The investigation of the E. coli outbreak linked to Nestle Toll House cookie dough is nearly over , according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . The cause of the contamination has not been identified . Nestle recalled all its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products made at a Danville , Virginia , plant . David Acheson , the FDA 's associate commissioner for foods , says the samples of cookie dough his agency has tested do not contain the E. coli strain that sickened 74 people in 32 states . On June 19 , Nestle recalled all its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products made at a Danville , Virginia , plant . Thirty-four people have been hospitalized ; no deaths have been reported . The CDC reports that the majority of the patients were teenage girls who reported eating the cookie dough raw . Last month , the FDA found E. coli in a production sample of Toll House cookie dough , but after testing , investigators found that the strain in the sample did not match the outbreak strain . `` We are still in speculation mode , '' Acheson said , but the E. coli `` most likely came from raw ingredients '' such as flour . The E.coli strain that caused the outbreak , 0157 : H7 , is typically found in fecal contamination from animals such as cows , sheep or goats . Acheson points out that it 's not unusual for those animals to be carrying more than one strain of the bacteria . But he believes that the root cause of the contamination may never be known . `` We have to conclude we 're unlikely to have a definitive determination , '' he said . Most people with E. coli 0157 : H7 experience diarrhea and abdominal cramps within eight days of infection . The FDA notified Nestle USA on Thursday that its investigation at the Danville plant was over . Nestle says FDA inspectors were at the plant for more than a week and found no E. coli on equipment . More than 1,000 tests have been conducted at the facility after the outbreak . `` We 've dismantled the production line and done extensive testing on all equipment and not found any E. coli , '' Nestle USA spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald said . MacDonald announced that Nestle is easing back into production at the plant . The company has purchased new lots of eggs , flour and margarine and says it is thoroughly testing the new products and all raw ingredients . Consumers will have to wait to see cookie dough back in grocery stores . `` You 're not going to see anything on the shelves for quite some time , '' MacDonald said . But when it does appear , the company will mark the cookie dough with a new label that clearly designates it as a new batch . It will also continue to carry a reminder to not eat the dough raw .","question":""}

Food and Drug Administration officials said Saturday that peanut butter and peanut paste made from ground roasted peanuts , manufactured in Peanut Corp. 's Blakely , Georgia , plant were found to contain the bacteria , although a direct link to the strain that has now sickened 474 people in 43 states has not been found . Six deaths may have been connected to this salmonella outbreak . Peanut Corp. announced an expanded recall of peanut butter and peanut paste produced from its Georgia plant Friday night . Peanut Corp. does n't directly supply to supermarkets , so brand-name peanut butters are not expected to be affected , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Instead , Peanut Corp. sells produce in bulk . The peanut butter is sold in containers from 5 to 1,700 pounds . Peanut paste is sold in sizes from 35-pound containers to tankers . The peanut paste is used in the manufacturing of cakes , candies , crackers , cookies and ice cream , FDA officials say . Minnesota and Connecticut health officials have confirmed salmonella Typhimurium linked to this outbreak in bulk containers found in institutions such as prisons , schools and nursing homes . The FDA is urging companies that make these foods to check whether they use peanut butter or paste produced by the company . The recalled peanut butter was manufactured on or after August 8 , 2008 ; the peanut paste was produced on or after September 26 , 2008 . The administration is urging companies to notify consumers if the products they manufacture may contain peanut products from Peanut Corp. . It is also urging companies whose products do not contain Peanut Corp. peanut butter or paste to make that information available to the public . The Kellogg Co. announced a voluntary recall of 16 products , including Keebler and Famous Amos peanut butter cookies , because they contain peanut butter that could be connected to Peanut Corp. . The FDA does not have the authority to order a recall of products . It has to rely on companies doing so voluntarily . Congress would have to pass a law to give the FDA such power Peanut Corp. products are also distributed by King Nut Co. , which voluntarily recalled its products a week ago . `` The majority of products -LSB- like cookies , crackers , ice cream -RSB- are manufactured with products that do n't come from PCA , '' said Dr. Stephen Sundlof , the FDA 's director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition . However , until people can be sure that the peanut cookies or crackers they have do not contain product from Peanut Corp. , the FDA is asking consumers to hold off on eating them . Sundlof said a previous outbreak linked to salmonella-contaminated peanut butter showed that the bacteria are not necessarily killed if the product is heat-treated or baked . `` It took temperatures up to 250 degrees -LSB- Fahrenheit -RSB- to kill salmonella , '' Sundlof said . Even if a cookie is cooked at 350 degrees , it does n't guarantee that the center of the food gets that hot , making it possible for some some salmonella bacteria to survive .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health officials expect more than 3 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine to be available in the first week of October . Three flu shot manufacturers were licensed by the FDA last week . `` 3.4 million doses of vaccines will be available , '' said Dr. Jay Butler , who heads the 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` All of that vaccine is the inhalable vaccine , '' he said Friday . That form of vaccine is marketed in the United States as FluMist and is approved only for healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 49 . Pregnant women are not allowed to get this type of vaccine because it contains a live virus . Butler added that he thinks there some flu shots may be available in early October as well , but he had a hard number only for the inhalable vaccine . Flu shots contain an `` inactivated , '' or dead , virus . Take a quiz about the H1N1 flu '' The 3.4 million doses of vaccine that will be shipped at the beginning of October are the first of 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers , Butler said . Last week , the Food and Drug Administration licensed the vaccine from four of those companies . Sanofi Pasteur , Novartis and CSL Limited all manufacture flu shots , and MedImmune manufactures the inhalable vaccine . GlaxoSmithkline , which also is producing injectable flu vaccine , still needs to have its vaccine approved by the agency . Health officials report that the new H1N1 flu virus has not changed from what was seen earlier this year , so they are expecting the vaccine to be very effective . In some parts of the country , the vaccine ca n't some soon enough . The deputy director of the CDC 's Influenza Division , Dr. Daniel Jernigan , said 21 states are now reporting widespread flu activity . `` It 's a very strange thing for us to see that amount of influenza at this time of year '' rather than much later in the flu season . Jernigan said there 's been only a small an increase in hospitalizations , mainly among young children and adults . But there has been a lot of activity in outpatient settings . Watch a report on the surprising spread of flu '' Until the vaccine becomes available , health officials have recommended steps that people can take to cut their chance of getting sick or , for those already sick , prevent the spread of the flu , including frequent handwashing , sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one 's hand , and staying home when sick . Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women , children , young adults and people with chronic lung or heart disease or diabetes -- should be the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus . Health care workers and emergency medical personnel are also encouraged be vaccinated early . `` Our goal is to ultimately make the vaccine available to every American who wishes to be vaccinated , '' Butler said . `` The vaccine demand is hard to predict . '' Learn more about the H1N1 flu from the CDC According to a CNN\/Opinion Corp. poll conducted in late August , 66 percent of Americans plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu . Health care workers may not necessarily be among them . In the past , only about 40 percent of health care workers have been vaccinated against flu , according to the CDC .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More troops , new legislation , improved troop training and added civilian expertise highlight President Obama 's strategy to fight terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan . President Obama , here with Hillary Clinton on Friday , calls the situation in Afghanistan `` increasingly perilous . '' Obama on Friday announced his plan to tackle what he called an `` international security challenge of the highest order . '' Stressing soberly that `` the safety of people around the world is at stake , '' Obama said the `` situation is increasingly perilous '' in the region in and around Afghanistan , where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7 1\/2 years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon . `` The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan . Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11 , 2001 , for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives , '' said Obama , who has vowed to make Afghanistan the central front in the fight against terrorism . `` So let me be clear : Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9\/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan . Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan . Watch how the U.S. will target terrorist safe havens '' `` And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . '' Obama said it is key Americans understand that Pakistan `` needs our help '' against al Qaeda . `` Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9\/11 . They have killed many Pakistani soldiers and police . They assassinated -LSB- former Pakistani Prime Minister -RSB- Benazir Bhutto . They have blown up buildings , derailed foreign investment and threatened the stability of the state . Make no mistake : Al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within . '' Watch Obama 's speech on Afghanistan , Pakistan threats '' Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Obama called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sens. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and Richard Lugar , R-Indiana . The legislation authorizes `` $ 1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools , roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan 's democracy , '' he said . He also urged Congress to pass legislation that would create opportunity zones in the border region . The goal is to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued by violence . Obama said , `` We will ask our friends and allies to do their part , '' including at a donors conference next month in Tokyo , Japan . `` After years of mixed results , we will not provide a blank check . Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders . And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets . '' Obama said the United States must work with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and others to help Pakistan get through the economic crisis . `` To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation , we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan . '' Afghan President Harmid Karzai watched the speech on CNN from Kabul , said Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan . Karzai `` is extremely grateful and will issue his statement of support , '' Holbrooke said . Obama stressed that `` Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq '' and now a commitment must be made . Obama said he is sending another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan , along with hundreds of civilian specialists , such as agricultural experts , educators and engineers . The troops -- which are in addition to the 17,000 announced earlier -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan army and police force . The stakes are high as al Qaeda and the Taliban have escalated the insurgency and the number of U.S. troops deaths spiked last year -- the highest yearly death toll for them in the war . Obama said the soldiers and Marines `` will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east '' and will work with Afghan troops along the border . He said such an effort will bolster `` security in advance of the important presidential election in August . '' Watch Obama tell terrorists U.S. will defeat them '' Obama said the coalition `` will accelerate '' efforts to `` build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward . '' He said Afghanistan 's government has been `` undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people '' and its economy is undercut by `` a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency . '' Watch Obama 's remarks on the Afghan situation '' Obama said the United States will set clear benchmarks for international assistance and wo n't ignore attention to corruption . He said the United States will develop a new contact group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that would include not only NATO allies and other partners but also Central Asian states , Gulf nations and Iran , Russia , India and China . Reacting to Obama 's plan , Sen. Russell Feingold , D-Wisconsin , said he is pleased the president is focusing on al Qaeda and is addressing the role of Pakistan but expressed concern the strategy could remain `` overly Afghan-centric . '' Citing Friday 's suicide attack on a mosque in the Pakistani tribal region near Afghanistan , Feingold said , `` This new administration must ensure that we do what we must not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan . '' He said , `` As the bombing near the Khyber Pass this morning highlights , we need to fully address the inextricable links between the crisis in Afghanistan and the instability and terrorist threats in Pakistan . '' The bombing killed at least 48 people and wounded 80 to 90 others . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Obama 's plan , saying it is `` a significant pivot '' away from the Democratic Party 's left wing . `` So the president 's decision to continue Secretary Gates , follow -LSB- U.S. Central Command chief -RSB- Gen. -LSB- David -RSB- Petraeus ' advice -- which may be somewhat exasperating to his own political left -- I think is in the best interest of the country and I think he 's going to enjoy pretty strong Republican support for the plan , '' the Kentucky Republican told reporters .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- The conventional wisdom , among most folks , anyway , is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity , by those on a budget -- that is , people who want , or need , to `` move down '' from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach . Bottom line , the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury , quality and long-term dependability . However , there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income : used luxury cars . For some buyers , the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus , Lincoln , Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted , without laying out $ 70,000 or $ 80,000 for something you 're not actually going to live in . For others , scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth . At this point , some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions . Recently , Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars , and divvied them up by price range . Using CR 's recommendations as a guideline , here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $ 24,000-30 ,000 price range . 2005 & 2006 Acura MDX A luxury SUV , the MDX is spacious , seats seven , and boasts distinctive styling and Acura 's famed attention to detail . Plus , it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter , 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission . AOL Autos : Used Acura Priced just right as a new vehicle , it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags , three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions . 2007 Acura RDX A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess , the '07 RDX offered unibody construction , leather upholstery , heated front seats , power moonroof , 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires , xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel , and the patented SH-AWD -LRB- SH for Super Handling -RRB- system . 2006 & 2007 Acura TL A mid-size , front-wheel-drive , four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6 , the Acura TL is a fine road machine . Actually , it was available for ' 06 - '07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine , a 286-hp 3.5-liter . Depending on trim level , you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel . 2007 Audi A3 Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics , and that is evident here , in a sharply-engineered , handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride , nimble handling and zesty performance . This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in ' 07 , and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox . AOL Autos : Used Audi 2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars , but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years\/versions\/features in the 3-Series family : The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible ; the '06 325i RWD sedan ; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4 . Depending on the model year and version , the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L . AOL Autos : Used BMW 2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35 Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years , the FX35 is one of the sportier editions . During these model years , the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission . Rear-wheel-drive was standard , but AWD was also an option . Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces , 18-inch wheels , dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls . AOL Autos : Used Infiniti Infiniti G35 The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road , offering Infiniti 's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude . Yes , it has four doors , but it handles like a sporty coupe , with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6 . Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual . Luxo amenities include leather upholstery , automatic climate control , steering wheel audio controls , illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge -LRB- HID -RRB- xenon headlamps . Lexus Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed , high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market , and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models , to the ' 03 - '04 GX edition , '03 LS , '04 \/ '06 IS entries , ' 04 - '05 RX model , '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well , you get the picture . Bottom line , given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury , quality and long-term dependability , it 's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries . And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities . AOL Autos : Used Lexus 2007 Lincoln MKX This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator , and made a big splash . A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge , it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny . Either FWD or AWD is available . One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the `` Vista Roof . '' 2007 Lincoln MKZ Also new for the '07 model year , this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr . Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission . FWD is standard , but AWD is optional . Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front ; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions ; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution . 2007 Lincoln Town Car A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back , the Town Car still `` has game '' -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s . It 's still cavernous inside , but now boasts a much more refined design . It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that 's linked to a four-speed automatic . The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques . Available in Signature , Signature Limited , Designer and Signature L trim levels , you can find one to fit any taste . 1998 Porsche 911 No , your eyes do n't deceive you -- CR did include a primo , high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $ 30,000 . But , take note : This is the 1998 edition . But when you 're dealing with quality of this level , even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it . So , by `` going vintage , '' driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank . In ' 98 , the 911 was powered by a 3.6 L H-6 282 hp engine . So , while it was n't quite the road-burner it is today , is still packed plenty of thrust . 2007 Volvo S60 -LRB- FWD -RRB- Only a year old , the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition , and it boasts top-drawer performance , stylish design and Volvo 's all-world safety features . The '07 S60 came in several trim levels , with an array of engine sizes , from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies . Depending on the trim line , either a manual or automatic transmission can be had . 2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70 The XC70 is a crossover vehicle , splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon . And it 's one of the finest crossovers on the road . It 's all-wheel drive , and the latest used-model-year , the ' 07 , was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sugar lovers may have to face a bitter truth : The less sugar added to foods for typical people , the better are their blood-fat profiles and the lower are their cardiovascular risks , a study to be published Wednesday concludes . `` We found that the lower the amount of added sugar people ate , the better their good cholesterol and their blood triglyceride levels , '' said co-author Dr. Miriam B. Vos , assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , and author of `` The No-Diet Obesity Solution for Kids . '' Unfortunately for dessert lovers , the converse is true . Increased sugars are associated with important cardiovascular disease risk factors , according to the report . The authors cited lower levels of HDL-C , which is sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol , and higher levels of triglycerides . The study , to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , highlights a trend some nutritionists consider disturbing : In recent years , the typical American 's diet has increasingly incorporated added sugars . The authors defined them as `` caloric sweeteners used by the food industry and consumers as ingredients in processed or prepared foods to increase the desirability of those foods . '' Data from the mid-1990s show that 15.8 percent of the typical American 's diet was composed of added sugar -- 21.4 teaspoons or 359 calories per day . That 's up from 10.6 percent in 1977-1978 . Added sugars have been linked to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay . The researchers studied 6,113 adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . Interviewers called them and asked what they had eaten the previous day , then estimated the total added sugar in each person 's diet . Participants were then separated into groups : Those who got less than 5 percent of total calories from added sugar ; 5 percent to less than 10 percent ; 10 percent to less than 17.5 percent ; 17.5 percent to less than 25 percent ; and 25 percent or more . Those in the highest-consuming added sugar group eat about 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day , the study said . Those who consumed more added sugar tended to be younger , non-Latino blacks with low income , it said . The report says 18.5 percent of Americans get at least 25 percent of their calories from added sugar . The strongest relationship between added sugar and blood fats was found in values for HDL-C , which fell from 58.7 mg\/dl for those who ate the least added sugar to 47.7 mg\/dl for those who ate the most . A higher HDL-C level is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk . Among some blood fats linked to higher cardiovascular risk , the converse was true : Triglyceride levels went from 105 mg\/dl in the group that ate the least sugar to 114 mg\/dl in the group that ate the most . The so-called bad cholesterol , LDL-C , went from 116 mg\/dl for women who ate the least sugar to 123 mg\/dl for women who ate the most . There were no significant trends for LDL-C among men . The authors concluded that their data support dietary guidelines that aim to cut consumption of added sugar . But those guidelines are all over the map . The Institute of Medicine recommends no more than 25 percent of total energy from added sugars ; the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent ; and the American Heart Association has recently advised no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men , which works out to about 5 percent . `` What it really means is we have to go back to things like whole grains and vegetables and fruit and eat things in moderation in order to be healthy , '' Vos said . `` Plus , a good healthy dose of activity . '' But the study compiled data based on a single day 's consumption , and it was not clear whether that day was representative of other days , she said . `` We do n't know that all of the people had their usual diet the day before , '' she said . `` There are always some weaknesses in that kind of data . '' Carbohydrates have been linked for decades to abnormal blood fat levels , `` but a big contemporary issue is added sugars , '' said Dr. Frank Sacks , professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston , Massachusetts . Vos ' study `` fills in a gap in the science base . '' The study will likely be discussed next month when the American Heart Association takes up the matter of added sugars at its meeting in Washington , he said . `` We just overeat too damn much , '' he said . `` What this study is saying is that , for some groups -- especially young people , black , poor -- sugar is just way too big a proportion of their intake . '' `` The real truth is that we 're supposed to eat a balanced diet , less processed food , '' said Carla Wolper , a nutritionist at the Obesity Research Center at St. Luke 's Hospital in New York and assistant professor at Columbia University 's Eating Disorders Center . Wolper praised the study for its size and careful construction . But Dr. Richard K. Bernstein , a diabetes specialist based in Mamaroneck , New York , was unimpressed . `` This is just one more study showing that carbohydrates create abnormal lipid profiles , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five years from now , there 's an excellent chance you wo n't have the same health insurance you have -LRB- or do n't have -RRB- right now . That 's because members of Congress are gearing up to reform the U.S. health care system , and unlike in 1993 when then-first lady Hillary Clinton tried her hand at changing the medical system , this time the important players -- doctors , insurance companies , pharmaceutical manufacturers -- seem to be on board . You heard a lot about health care reform this week , and you 'll be hearing even more in the months to come . It 's an incredibly confusing , complex issue , so in this week 's Empowered Patient , we break it down for you with 10 frequently asked questions about health care reform . Overhauling health care is key to U.S. economic stability , President Obama tells doctors Monday . 1 . Why is health care reform such a hot issue right now ? Fewer and fewer Americans have health insurance , and therefore can not afford good medical care . Nearly 46 million Americans have no insurance , and 25 million more are underinsured . One major reason for this crisis is that many employers have stopped offering insurance to employees because of the high cost . In the United States , total health care spending was $ 2.4 trillion in 2007 -- or $ 7,900 per person -- according to an analysis published in the journal Health Affairs . The United States spends 52 percent more per person than the next most costly nation , Norway , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . There 's little debate that health care reform is necessary -- President Obama , Republican and Democratic members of Congress , the American Medical Association and America 's Health Insurance Plans , which represents the insurance industry , all have agreed the system needs to be changed , although they disagree on how to do it . 2 . So let 's start with Obama . What are his plans for revamping the system ? A central point of the president 's plan is to create a government-sponsored health insurance program that would be an option for all Americans , similar to how Medicare is now an option for Americans over age 65 . He has also said he 'd `` like to see '' prohibitions against insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions , and incentives for people to use preventive services and wellness plans . Obama outlined this plan last week at a town hall meeting in Green Bay , Wisconsin , and on his Web site . 3 . How does the president plan to pay for this ? Obama said he 's already identified `` hundreds of billions of dollars '' worth of savings in the federal budget that could help finance health care reform , such as rooting out waste , fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid . He 's also proposed reducing tax deductions for high-income Americans . 4 . What do the Republicans think of Obama 's plan ? In particular , they do n't like the idea of having a government-sponsored health insurance program for all Americans . They fear employers would opt for the government-run insurance over private insurance because the government option would most likely be less expensive , but Republicans say it would also be lower quality . For information , see House Minority Leader John Boehner 's Web site . 5 . Since they do n't like Obama 's ideas , how would Republicans like to reform health care ? Republicans think Obama 's plan is costly and will make health insurance more expensive , not less . In a plan outlined this week , House Republicans proposed individual tax breaks for buying health insurance and `` pools '' of states and small business to get lower-cost health care plans . They also proposed increasing incentives for people to build health savings accounts , allowing dependent children to stay on parents ' policies until age 25 and encouraging employers to reward employees for improved health . 6 . I 'm happy with the insurance I receive from my employer . What would health care reform mean for me ? If you receive high-quality health insurance from your employer , Obama said , his plan wo n't change that , and you can still keep your insurance and your doctors . Republicans , however , said that if Obama gets his way , there 's a good chance your employer will stop buying the private insurance you have now and instead opt for the less-expensive government plan . 7 . I have a pre-existing condition and ca n't get health insurance . Will health care reform help me ? You have a terrible problem and you 're in good company . Millions of people who do n't get insurance through their employer try to get insurance on their own and are turned down because they have a pre-existing condition . Obama said at the Green Bay town hall meeting that under his reforms , no insurance plan `` would be able to deny coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions , '' but he did n't explain how he would force insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing health problems . Similarly , Boehner wrote on his blog that `` quality health coverage must exist for every American , regardless of pre-existing health conditions , '' but did not explain how he would pay to insure people with pre-existing conditions . 8 . How do doctors feel about health care reform ? The American Medical Association said while it believes in health care reform , `` the AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage . '' The AMA has told members of Congress that doctors fear a new government-sponsored health insurance program would reimburse them at Medicare rates . `` Medicare reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the cost of practice , '' AMA President Dr. Nancy Nielsen told CNN earlier this week . `` Our Medicare rates are back at 2001 rates , and the reality is , that 's not where our rent is , that 's not where the electricity is . The system for paying doctors is a broken system , and everybody acknowledges it . '' Other doctors ' groups , however , support the idea . The American Academy of Family Physicians , the National Physicians Alliance and other groups put out a statement of support this week for Obama 's plan . `` Having the choice of a public health insurance plan will help make health care more affordable for patients , foster greater competition in the insurance market and guarantee that quality , affordable coverage will be there for our patients no matter what happens , '' they wrote in a joint statement . . 9 . Obama has mentioned high health care costs in McAllen , Texas , several times . What 's up with that ? According to research conducted at the Dartmouth Institute , the average per person health costs for McAllen are sky-high compared with costs in other cities . In McAllen , the average Medicare beneficiary spends $ 15,758 per year , while the average Medicare patient in LaCrosse , Wisconsin , spends $ 6,412 per year . Another comparison : The cost in Miami , Florida , is $ 18,170 , compared with $ 7,478 in Portland , Oregon . Dartmouth researchers believe doctors in high-priced cities tend to refer to specialists more and are more likely to put patients in the hospital rather than handling their problems on an outpatient basis . 10 . How do health care costs in the U.S. compare with costs in other countries ? In the United States , every person spends on average $ 6,714 for health care . That 's significantly higher than in the United Kingdom , where $ 2,760 per person is spent ; or in France , where the cost is $ 3,449 per person ; or in Canada , where medical costs are $ 3,678 per person , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . While some would argue that medical care is better in the United States than in these other countries , others would say the opposite is true . For example , the United States ranks 50th in life expectancy , and 180th infant mortality -LRB- meaning 179 countries have higher infant mortality rates such as Angola and Turkey and 43 countries have lower infant mortality rates such as France and Sweden -RRB- according to the CIA World Factbook .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal and state health officials said Monday that salmonella linked last week in Minnesota to King Nut peanut butter was caused by the same strain of bacteria responsible for an ongoing outbreak of 410 salmonella cases in 43 states . Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods . The infection may have contributed to three deaths , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday . `` Preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by CDC and public health officials in multiple states comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons has suggested peanut butter as a likely source , '' the disease agency said in a written statement . `` To date , no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores . '' A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said Monday that the agency has been collaborating with the CDC , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and public health officials in many states to investigate the outbreak of infections due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium . `` This new information from Minnesota will not change what we are currently doing as part of the investigation , '' said FDA spokesman Michael Herndon . What you need to know about food poisoning \u00c2 '' The Minnesota bacteria were linked last week to institutionally distributed peanut butter , sold under the King Nut brand name . In one of the Minnesota patients , a 70-year-old female nursing home resident , the infection proved fatal , said Doug Schultz , a Minnesota public health department spokesman . `` We do not know to what extent the salmonella contributed to the death , '' said Schultz , who added that the patient had other underlying illnesses . Virginia Health officials confirm that two of the three deaths linked to the salmonella outbreak were from their state . Although she could not provide a lot of information due to privacy laws , Michelle Peregoy , a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health tells CNN that one person who died was over age 65 and from the Southwest part of the state , the other person who died was a younger adult between the ages of 25-64 . As with the Minnesota patient , both Virgina patients had underlying illnesses , which means they had weakended immune systems . Very young people , older people and those with compromised immune systems are the most vulnerable to severe side effects , including death . Late last week , King Nut Companies , based in Ohio , recalled King Nut peanut butter . President and CEO Martin Kanan said the product is manufactured by a Lynchburg , Virginia-based company , Peanut Corporation of America . `` King Nut took this action as soon as it was informed that salmonella had been found in an open five-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter , '' the company said Saturday in a posting on its Web site . King Nut , which distributes peanut butter through food service accounts , does not sell directly to consumers . Kanan said King Nut has asked customers to stop distributing peanut butter with lot codes beginning with `` 8 '' and has canceled orders with the manufacturer . The first cases nationwide were reported September 3 , but most occurred between October 1 and December 31 , the CDC said last week . About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness , and patients have ranged from 2 months to 98 years of age . California has reported the highest case count with 55 , followed by Ohio with 53 , Massachusetts with 39 , Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20 . The other 37 states are each reporting from one to 19 cases . The seven states that have reported no cases connected to the outbreak are Montana , New Mexico , Louisiana , Mississippi , South Carolina , Florida and Alaska . Strains of salmonella linked to outbreaks in the past have been traced to contaminated eggs , meat , poultry , vegetables , pet food and peanut butter . Contaminated tomatoes were blamed for an outbreak in the fall of 2006 caused by salmonella Typhimurium , which sickened at least 183 people in 21 states . Most people suffered from diarrhea and fever for about a week . No one is known to have died in that outbreak . Salmonella infections can be treated with antibiotics , though some strains are resistant to these drugs , according to the CDC . Most people infected develop diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection and the illness can last up to a week . Most recover without treatment , but some may suffer dehydration and , in severe cases , require hospitalization . Children , senior citizens , people with chronic illnesses and those with weak immune systems tend to be at highest risk for complications , according to the National Institutes of Health .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pennsylvania and the nation said goodbye Tuesday to John P. Murtha , politician , warrior , father , friend , gentleman . Speakers at the funeral for the Democratic congressman recalled a man skilled in the ways of Washington but , more importantly , a public servant who never forgot why he was elected 17 times to represent Pennsylvania 's 12th district . `` Jack Murtha never lost sight of God 's purpose in the law , '' said the Rev. William George , president of the Georgetown Preparatory School in Washington . `` Lawmaking should be sacred work , and Jack knew that . '' Murtha , 77 , died February 8 of complications from gall bladder surgery . A former Marine colonel and twice-wounded Vietnam War veteran , Murtha earned a reputation as one of Congress 's loudest anti-war voices . He initially supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq , but he stunned much of Washington when he called for a swift U.S. pullout in November 2005 . `` U.S. and coalition troops have done all they can , '' Murtha said . `` It 's time for a change in direction . '' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who led a bipartisan delegation to the funeral , remembered her long-time ally . `` Those who served with him were honored to call him a colleague , '' Pelosi said . `` There were those of us who were privileged to call him friend . '' President Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates were among those who filled Westmont Presbyterian Church in Johnstown , Pennsylvania , for the funeral . Murtha 's daughter , Donna , recalled his love of nature and how he enjoyed feeding wild birds , but not squirrels that raided the birdseed . `` He loved to outwit the squirrels , '' Donna Murtha said , her voice breaking at times . `` He could not stand it if they were outwitting him . '' Others recalled Murtha 's dedication to public service . `` Today there is great comfort in the memory of John P. Murtha 's life , '' said the Rev. Douglas Stevens , pastor of Westmont Presbyterian . `` He made a difference . '' Murtha underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gall bladder January 28 at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland . He was released but rehospitalized a few days later after the complications developed . The operation had been scheduled after Murtha was hospitalized for a few days in December . Murtha represented Pennsylvania 's 12th Congressional District in the House since 1974 , making him the chamber 's eighth most senior member . Two days before he died , Murtha became the state 's longest-serving congressman . He also was the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress , his biography on the House Web site says . Murtha was considered one of `` the kings of pork '' on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups for requesting tens of millions of dollars in earmarks . The congressman strongly defended earmarks , saying on his Web site , `` I believe that elected representatives of the people understand their constituents and districts best . '' Supporters said his efforts helped bring thousands of jobs to western Pennsylvania . Born June 17 , 1932 , in West Virginia , Murtha moved with his family to Pennsylvania as a child . Prior to joining the House of Representatives , he served in the Pennsylvania state legislature . He also served 37 years in the Marines and Marine Corps Reserves . He retired from the Reserves in 1990 and received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal . Murtha attended Washington and Jefferson College but dropped out in 1952 to enlist in the Marines . He later graduated from the University of Pittsburgh . He is survived by his wife , Joyce , daughter , Donna , and two sons . `` When they made dad , they broke the mold , '' Donna Murtha said during the funeral . `` He lived by the motto , one man can make a difference . '' Murtha was scheduled to be buried later Tuesday at a private ceremony .","question":""}

Jailed polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs , seen in September , has been hospitalized in Las Vegas . Authorities took Jeffs from an Arizona jail to a Nevada hospital on Tuesday after he saying he looked feverish and was `` acting in a convulsive manner , and looked in a very weakened state . '' Doctors there determined he should go to a larger facility , so Jeffs was flown to the Sunrise Medical Center in Las Vegas . Sheriff Tom Sheahan of Mohave County , Arizona said before Jeffs ' release that his condition was not believed to be life-threatening . Further details about his release on Wednesday were unavailable . Sheahan said he is trying to get information about Jeffs ' condition .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A total of seven cases of a previously undetected strain of swine flu have been confirmed in humans in the United States , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . None of the patients has had direct contact with pigs . Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them . Five of the cases have been found in California , and two have been found in Texas , near San Antonio , said Dr. Anne Schuchat , the CDC 's Interim Deputy Director for Science and Public Health Program . The CDC reported Tuesday that two children in the San Diego , California , area , infected with a virus called swine influenza A H1N1 , whose combination of genes has not been seen in flu viruses in either human or pigs before . The patients range from age 9 to 54 , Schuchat said . They include two 16-year-old boys who attend the same Texas school , and a father and daughter in California . `` The good news is that all seven of these patients have recovered , '' Schuchat said . The first two cases were picked up through a special influenza monitoring program , with stations in San Diego and El Paso , Texas . The program aims to get a better sense of what strains exist and to detect new strains before they become widespread , the CDC said . Other cases emerged through routine and expanded surveillance . At this point , the ability for the human influenza vaccine to protect against this new swine flu strain is unknown , and studies are ongoing , she said . There is no danger from contracting the virus from eating pork products , Schuchat said . The new virus has genes from North American swine and avian influenza , human influenza and swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe , said Nancy Cox , chief of the CDC 's Influenza Division . Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza , according to the CDC . It does not normally inflect humans , but cases have occurred among people , especially those who have had direct exposure to pigs . There have also been cases in the past of one person spreading swine flu to other people , the CDC said . In 1988 , in an apparent swine flu infection in pigs in Wisconsin , there was antibody evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care workers who had contact with the patient , the CDC said . Person-to-person transmission is believed to occur in a manner similar to the spread of the influenza virus : through infected people coughing and sneezing , the CDC said . People may contract swine flu by touching something with viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose . From December 2005 to February 2009 , 12 cases of human infection with swine flu were documented . Symptoms of swine flu in humans are expected to resemble regular human seasonal influenza symptoms , including fever , lethargy , lack of appetite , and coughing , the CDC said . Other reported symptoms include runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea . The new strain of swine flu has been resistant to the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine , but has responded to the other licensed options : oseltamivir and zanamivir . The CDC is working closely with health officials in California and Texas to learn more about the virus . The agency expects to find more cases , Schuchat said . If swine flu can mutate to spread between humans , what does this mean for avian flu ? Because of the virus subtype , it is less likely that avian flu would become transmissible from person to person , but still possible , said Dr. William Short at the division of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The news is not cause for widespread panic , but people at risk -- those who live in or have traveled to the areas where patients live , or have been in contact with pigs -- should watch out for symptoms and get tested if they occur , Short said . The three criteria for a pandemic are a new virus to which everybody is susceptible , the ability to spread from person to person readily , and wide geographic spread , said Dr. Jay Steinberg , infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta , Georgia . The new strain of swine flu only meets one of these criteria : its novelty . On the other hand , bird flu meets two of the criteria : novelty and geographic spread . If history is any indication , flu pandemics tend to occur once every 20 years or so , meaning we 're actually due for one , he said . However , it is not likely to be the swine flu , he said . `` I can say with 100 percent confidence that a pandemic of a new flu strain will spread in humans , '' Steinberg said . `` What I ca n't say is when it will occur .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An estimated 125,000 Western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial Africa , researchers reported Tuesday , double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide . Forest clearings draw large numbers of Western lowland gorillas searching for food . `` It 's pretty astonishing , '' Hugo Rainey , one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society , told CNN Tuesday . The last census on the species , carried out during the 1980s , estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide . Since then , the researchers estimated , the numbers had been cut in half . WCS survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007 , traveling to the remote Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Republic of Congo , a vast area of swamp forest . Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas , Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele , about 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from the nearest road . `` When we went there , we found an astonishing amount of gorillas , '' said Rainey , speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh , Scotland . Though researchers did spot some gorillas , they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site , Rainey said . Each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night . `` This is the highest-known density of gorillas that 's ever been found , '' Rainey said . Watch a glimpse of gorilla life in African swamp '' Western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered , the highest threat category for a species .

Only about 250 to 300 are estimated to remain in the world , the WCS says . War , habitat loss , poaching and disease are the major threats to the mountain gorillas , made famous by researcher Dian Fossey and the film `` Gorillas in the Mist . '' The mountain gorilla population is starting to recover after decades of conservation work . From a population of around 230 in the 1970s , the mountain gorillas now number around 700 , the WCS says .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former college and pro football star Charles Aaron `` Bubba '' Smith , who went on to an acting career after his retirement from sports , was found dead at his home , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said Wednesday . He was 66 . Police and fire officials were called to Smith 's home after `` he was found unresponsive '' and pronounced him dead , said Ed Winter , assistant chief of operations and investigation for the coroner . An autopsy will be performed to determine cause of death , Winter said . However , asked if there was any reason to believe the death was due to anything other than natural causes , he replied , `` Not at this time . '' An imposing 6 foot 8 and 260 pounds , Smith was considered one of the most fearsome pass rushers of his day . The No. 1 overall pick in the 1967 National Football League draft , he played nine seasons in the NFL -- for the Baltimore Colts , Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers . Sports Illustrated gallery : The NFL goes Hollywood He played for the Colts in two Super Bowls and was also a two-time Pro Bowl pick . Smith was one of the anchors of an overwhelming defense that was heavily favored to win Super Bowl III . Nonetheless , the New York Jets , led by Joe Namath , defeated the Colts in the 1969 championship of pro football , widely considered one of the biggest upsets in U.S. sports history . The Colts atoned for that embarrassment -- somewhat -- two years later in a 16-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V , but Smith reportedly said he was so dismayed by the game 's sloppiness that he never wore his Super Bowl ring . Smith was sidelined by a severe knee injury during an exhibition game in 1972 , and the next season joined the Raiders . He told Sports Illustrated in 1973 that `` not playing was terrible . I did n't want to show my face in public . I do n't know if it was that we were losing or what , but it almost drove me crazy . '' After retiring from pro football in 1975 , Smith landed small roles on TV series such as `` Good Times , '' `` Charlie 's Angels '' and `` Semi-Tough , '' according to IMDb , before landing his signature role as Lt. Moses Hightower in the first `` Police Academy '' movie in 1984 . He reprised the role in all six movies in the popular comedy franchise . Smith was a two-time All-America defensive end at Michigan State University . He played in what the national media dubbed `` the game of the century '' between Michigan State and Notre Dame in 1966 , a 10-10 tie that resulted in the two teams ' splitting the vote for that year 's national championship . Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988 , an event he called `` the jewel in my crown , for my collegiate days were very special to me . '' Smith was born on February 28 , 1945 , in Beaumont Texas . His father was a high school football coach and his mother had earned two college degrees . According to his member biography on the College Football Hall of Fame website , he said he took his parents with him when he went to speak to youth groups `` to demonstrate my respect for them .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Dutch man once considered a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway has told a television station he dumped her body in a swamp , Aruba 's chief prosecutor told CNN . However , Joran van der Sloot 's claims to Dutch station RTL-5 are `` unbelievable , '' prosecutor Peter Blanken said . RTL-5 said Tuesday it had `` acquired exclusive material containing a statement by Joran van der Sloot '' regarding Holloway 's disappearance . `` This material was first offered to us in 2009 , '' Remko van Westerloo , the station 's director of programming , said in a statement . `` Obviously , our initial response was skeptical , '' van Westerloo said . `` However , we did feel that this interview required thorough research . We 've spoken to a variety of experts and several critics . These findings resulted in a TV special which will air this Sunday . It 's up to the viewers to form their own opinions on the matter . '' The statement did not divulge the contents of van der Sloot 's interview . However , Blanken told CNN on Tuesday that van der Sloot says in the interview that he dumped Holloway 's body `` in a swamp on the north end of the island . '' `` He was very unspecific , '' Blanken said . Blanken said RTL contacted him about the interview last summer , and the station showed the interview to him to get his reaction . He said his office and Aruban police investigated . `` We tried to verify it , '' Blanken said . `` It could n't be true . We talked with several witnesses and reviewed several facts . The story is unbelievable and not true , in my opinion . '' He said his office told van der Sloot `` we 'd like him to come in and speak with us about it . He failed to respond . '' Asked why van der Sloot gave the interview , Blanken said , `` You should ask him . Maybe he wanted to be on camera or make some money . '' Holloway was 18 when last seen in the early hours of May 30 , 2005 , leaving an Oranjestad , Aruba , nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men , brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe . She was visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama . Holloway failed to show up for her flight home the following day , and her packed bags were found in her hotel room . Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were arrested and released in 2005 in connection with the case . In 2007 , they were arrested a second time after Aruba 's then-chief prosecutor , Hans Mos , said he had received new evidence in the case . Van der Sloot , who was attending college in the Netherlands , was brought back to Aruba . But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared with one of the three youths saying she was dead -- was not enough to keep them jailed . In 2008 , prosecutors sought unsuccessfully to arrest van der Sloot a third time after a videotape surfaced on Dutch television . In it , van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub , then she `` started shaking '' and lost consciousness . He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat . The two put Holloway 's body in the boat , he said , and then he went home . The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it in the ocean . `` I did n't lose a minute of sleep over it , '' van der Sloot said on the tape . Holloway 's mother , Beth Twitty , told ABC at the time that the video showed van der Sloot was `` not innocent . '' But an Aruba court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him . Aruban prosecutors said authorities had met with van der Sloot in the Netherlands , but in a two-hour interview he denied any role in Holloway 's disappearance . Van der Sloot acknowledged to a Dutch television program he made the comments , but said he was lying . `` That is what he wanted to hear , so I told him what he wanted to hear , '' he said . `` When -LSB- van der Sloot -RSB- really wants to tell the truth , -LSB- we hope -RSB- he will , '' said Blanken , who took over as chief prosecutor in September . `` He did n't tell the truth -LSB- this time -RSB- .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of America 's top World War II fighter pilots , an African-American who took on Nazis abroad and racism at home , was laid to rest Friday at Arlington National Cemetery . Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Lee A. Archer , one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen , died last month in New York at the age of 90 . Archer , who once shot down three German fighters in the span of only a few minutes , went on to become a corporate executive and venture capitalist . His life came to be seen as an example of the potential of any individual , regardless of skin color or background , if given a fair opportunity . Lee Andrew Archer Jr. was born in 1919 in Yonkers , New York . An aviation enthusiast from childhood , he left New York University in 1941 to join the Army . Despite passing a pilot 's test , he was assigned as a communications specialist in Camp Wheeler , Georgia . But several months later , after the United States declared war on the Axis powers , Archer was selected to join a training program for potential black pilots at Alabama 's Tuskegee Army Air Field . Archer graduated first in the program in July 1943 and , after receiving his commission as a second lieutenant , was deployed to Italy as part of the 332nd Fighter Group . On October 12 , 1944 , while piloting a P-51 Mustang , Archer downed three Luftwaffe fighters in the sky over Nazi-occupied Hungary . He also was credited with shooting down a fighter over Germany earlier in the year . U.S. military officials could not confirm a fifth downing by Archer in summer 1944 . If they had been able to do so , he would have become the only Tuskegee Airman to be officially designated as an ace . By the end of World War II , Archer had flown 169 combat missions , providing cover and escorting U.S. bombers in over 11 countries , according to the Air Force . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . Archer remained in the military through 1970 , witnessing its desegregation during the Truman administration and serving in several capacities . Among other things , he became a diplomatic officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and was chief of headquarters at the U.S. Air Force Southern Command in Panama . He received special citations for his service from Presidents Eisenhower , Kennedy and Johnson . After retiring from the military , Archer became an executive at General Foods and started Archer Asset Management , a venture capital firm . Archer 's wife , Ina , died in 1996 . He is survived by three sons .","question":""}
{"answer":"Editor 's note : Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh are attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and co-authors of `` Administration of Torture : A Documentary Record from Washington to Abu Ghraib and Beyond '' . Jaffer is counsel to the plaintiffs in ACLU v. Department of Defense , a lawsuit that has forced the release of more than 100,000 pages of government documents concerning the abuse of prisoners . Singh is lead counsel in the suit seeking disclosure of photographs of U.S. personnel abusing prisoners at overseas locations . Jameel Jaffer says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last week President Obama announced that he would suppress prisoner abuse photographs that he earlier said he would release . Given the president 's stated commitment to government transparency , this reversal was both surprising and profoundly disappointing . The ACLU has sought release of these photos for almost six years . In October 2003 , we filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records -- including photographs -- relating to the abuse of prisoners in U.S. detention facilities overseas . In 2005 , a federal judge in New York ruled that the Bush administration 's refusal to disclose the photographs was unlawful , and in 2008 a federal appeals court unanimously affirmed that decision . The Bush administration continued to suppress the photos , and now President Obama has vowed to do the same . The photos are a critical part of the historical record . The government has acknowledged that they depict prisoner abuse at locations other than Abu Ghraib , and it 's clear that the photos would provide irrefutable evidence that abuse was widespread and systemic . The photos would also shed light on the connection between the abuse and the decisions of high-level Bush administration officials . As the district court recognized , the photos are `` the best evidence of what happened . '' In explaining his change of heart , President Obama said that the release of the photos `` would not add any additional benefit '' to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners . But the ongoing public debate is rife with false claims , and the photos would expose the truth . The Bush administration told the public that abuse was aberrational and isolated , and many media organizations adopted this fraudulent narrative as their own . But even President Obama , in explaining his reversal , perpetuated the myth that the abuse of prisoners `` was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals . '' President Obama 's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate , but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important . Many Americans still believe that abuse took place in spite of policy rather than because of it . The truth is that senior officials authorized the use of barbaric interrogation methods that the U.S. once prosecuted as war crimes , and even abuse that was not expressly authorized was traceable to a climate in which abuse was tolerated and often encouraged . The photos would help tell this story . President Obama 's other rationale for suppressing the photographs is that they would `` inflame anti-American opinion and put our troops in greater danger , '' an argument that was repeatedly rejected by the courts when made by the Bush administration . Nobody , of course , wants to see anyone get hurt by the release of this or any other information . But the fundamental problem with the government 's argument is that it lacks a limiting principle . Any photograph of prisoner abuse , civilian casualties in Afghanistan , or U.S. military operations in Iraq could be used to `` inflame anti-American opinion '' ; indeed , the same is true of any news article that discusses -LRB- for example -RRB- torture , Guantanamo , or the CIA 's secret prisons . iReport.com : Did Obama make the right decision on photos ? To give the government the power to suppress information because it might anger an unidentified set of people in an unspecified part of the world and ultimately endanger an ill-defined group of U.S. personnel would be to invest it with a virtually unlimited censorial power . And by investing it with such power , we would effectively be affording the greatest protection from disclosure to records that depict the worst kinds of government misconduct . President Obama has inherited a legacy of lawlessness and abuse , and it 's not easy to untangle that . But the idea that suppressing the photographs will help the country turn the page on the last eight years is misguided . We can not make a clean break with the past until the public knows what happened in the detention centers and why . Blinding ourselves to the ugly consequences of the Bush administration 's policies only deprives us of the opportunity to learn from recent history . And if we fail to learn from this history , we are bound to repeat it . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy . Now , a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit . Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care . Depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby . Therefore , the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women , researchers say . `` There is no easy way out of this , '' says Dr. Tim Oberlander , a developmental pediatrician at BC Children 's Hospital , in Vancouver , Canada , who has studied the effects of SSRIs on children exposed in the womb , but was not involved in the current study . `` Depression needs to be managed , and for some women , the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary . '' Health.com : 3 Signs you should stop , adjust , or switch antidepressants The new study , led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund , of Aarhus University , in Denmark , found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU . Women have been using SSRIs during pregnancy since the early 1990s , Lund and her colleagues point out in the report , which is published in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine . These drugs , which include Zoloft , Prozac , and others , are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy . It 's been difficult to confirm their safety , however , especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in , like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn . Health.com : Do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix ? Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but were n't taking SSRIs . Some , but not all , of these women had suffered from depression . `` Using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders , '' the researcher notes . The analysis included 329 women who took SSRIs in pregnancy , 4,902 with a history of psychiatric illness who were n't taking the drugs , and 51,770 women who reported no history of psychiatric illness and were n't taking SSRIs . All had received prenatal care at Aarhus University Hospital between 1989 and 2006 . Babies of women taking SSRIs were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness , and were twice as likely to be born preterm . The babies whose mothers took SSRIs were 2.4 times as likely to have been admitted to the NICU than infants who had n't been exposed to the drugs in utero . They were also more than four times as likely to have Apgar scores below eight , just five minutes after birth . -LRB- Apgar scores measure an infant 's health at birth by looking at his or her breathing , heartbeat , reflexes , muscle tone , and skin color ; scores of seven and above are considered normal , and a newborn 's Apgar score has no influence on how he or she will fare later in life . -RRB- There was no difference between SSRI-exposed babies and unexposed babies in head circumference or birth weight . Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women 's mental health during pregnancy , notes Oberlander , who says depression in pregnancy is a `` huge public health issue '' with lasting implications for women and their children . Helping ensure that women are getting enough social support and adequate nutrition is essential , he adds , while alternative treatments for depression -- such as exercise , light therapy , and omega-3 fatty acids -- ought to be explored further . `` In general , optimizing non-pharmacological treatment would be a really important step , '' he says . He explains that it is essential to follow SSRI-exposed babies as they grow up , to identify any problems and intervene as necessary . However , he and Lund agree that it 's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child 's development and health .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California , Swiss police said Sunday . Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris , France , in June 2009 . Polanski , 76 , was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday , Zurich police said . A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport . He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for `` The Pianist '' in 2003 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl . But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced , and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978 . Watch what happens now for Polanski '' Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for `` Tess '' and `` Chinatown , '' and for best writing for `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' which he also directed . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a Polanski tribute this year , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles , California , after authorities learned Polanski was going to be in Switzerland , Sandi Gibbons , spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , told CNN on Sunday . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put `` in provisional detention . '' But whether he can be extradited to the United States `` can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , '' a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail . `` It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , '' the spokesman wrote . `` Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . '' Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland , but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski 's sentencing process , depending on what happens in Zurich . Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski 's case was handled years ago . According to court documents , Polanski , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial . But the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . Polanski fled the United States for France , where he was born . In the February hearing , Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send Polanski to prison . `` It 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , '' said Espinoza . But he declined to dismiss the case entirely . Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out . Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Following Espinoza 's ruling earlier this year , Geimer 's lawyer , Larry Silver , said he was disappointed and that Espinoza `` did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption . '' He argued in court that had `` Mr. Polanski been treated fairly '' his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime . Polanski 's arrest Saturday came two days after one of his wife 's killers died . The director 's pregnant wife , actress Sharon Tate , and four others were butchered by members of the Manson `` family '' in August 1969 . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk was granted an emergency stay late Tuesday to block what appeared to be his imminent deportation to Germany . Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents remove John Demjanjuk from his home Tuesday . The ruling , handed down by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , came less than two hours after federal immigration officials took Demjanjuk into custody at his home near Cleveland , Ohio . Demjanjuk , 89 , is wanted by German authorities for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor , a Nazi death camp in Poland . The Justice Department would not immediately comment on the stay , saying officials needed to review the order . The last-minute legal maneuvering leading to the order was the latest chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history . The deportation of Demjanjuk , who had been transported to an Ohio detention facility when the stay was issued , would set the stage for what would likely prove to be an extraordinary German war crimes trial . `` Upon due consideration of the motion for a stay and the opposition by the attorney general , we conclude that a stay of removal is warranted , '' the circuit court wrote . Representatives of Attorney General Eric Holder argued in response to an emergency motion filed by Demjanjuk 's attorney that the circuit court does not have jurisdiction over the case . But the court acted anyway . `` Because it is our understanding that the government may remove the petitioner later today , we are compelled to rule on the motion for a stay prior to addressing the jurisdictional concerns raised by the government , '' the court said . On Friday , a federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal for a stay of Demjanjuk 's deportation . His attorney , John Broadley , had argued that deporting him would constitute torture because of his health problems . Broadley has said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia , kidney problems , spinal problems and `` a couple of types of gout . '' When Broadley filed another appeal with the 6th Circuit Court , Justice Department officials said they believe that his chances of getting the board 's ruling overturned are slim . `` Looking at what 's going on in Cleveland ... is truly appalling , '' Broadley said shortly after Demjanjuk was taken into custody . `` You have an 89-year-old man with various physical ailments , and you have eight guys from -LSB- Immigration and Customs Enforcement -RSB- trying to stuff him into a wheelchair to send him to Germany . This looks like something taking place in Germany and not in the United States . '' Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley 's argument for his client . `` He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor , '' Hier said . He called Demjanjuk 's comparison of his planned deportation to torture `` preposterous coming from a person that served the -LSB- Nazi organization -RSB- S.S. in a death camp . It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust . '' Hier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless . `` You were there for one job : kill the Jews , '' he said . `` And that 's what they did full-time . '' He called the evidence against Demjanjuk `` overwhelming . '' German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at Sobibor from March to September 1943 . The warrant was issued after the authorities concluded that an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations was genuine . Demjanjuk , a retired auto worker , has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades . He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel , where he was convicted in 1986 of being `` Ivan the Terrible , '' a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp . The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal , and he returned to the United States . The United States filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard . He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , after fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court . Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian , says he saw action in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans . CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In their attacks on the food stamp program , some Republican presidential candidates are leaving a deeply misleading impression of the nation 's leading anti-hunger program . No one aspires to enroll , but for those who must , it is an essential lifeline that addresses one of the harshest impacts of poverty and unemployment -- hunger . The food stamp program , now officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -LRB- SNAP -RRB- , provides about 46 million Americans in about 22 million low-income households with debit cards to buy food each month . Participants include families with adults who work in low-wage jobs , unemployed workers and people on fixed incomes , such as Social Security . About three-fourths of SNAP recipients live in households with children ; more than one-quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities . SNAP reduces poverty while providing people with much-needed help to buy food . The program kept more than 5 million people out of poverty in 2010 and lessened the severity of poverty for millions of others , under a measure of poverty that counts SNAP benefits as income . SNAP is also highly efficient , with one of the most rigorous quality control systems of any public benefit program . In 2010 , only 3 percent of payments went to ineligible households or to eligible households in excessive amounts . Payment accuracy has been improving in the past few years , despite a large increase in SNAP enrollment . While some have attributed that enrollment increase to Obama administration policies -- Newt Gingrich has termed President Barack Obama the `` food stamp president '' -- in reality it has two main causes that have little to do with this administration . Millions of people hit by the recession a few years ago became eligible for SNAP . Today 's large SNAP caseloads mostly reflect the extraordinarily deep and prolonged recession and the weak recovery that has followed . Long-term unemployment hit record levels in 2010 and has remained extremely high . Today , 43 % of all unemployed workers have been out of work for more than half a year ; the previous post-World War II high was 26 % in 1983 . Workers who are unemployed for a long time are more likely to deplete their assets , exhaust unemployment insurance and turn to SNAP for help . It is one of the few safety net programs available to them . In most states , other programs -- such as cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and state General Assistance programs -- have not responded effectively to the rising need brought on by the economy . More than one in five workers who had been unemployed for over six months received SNAP in 2010 , according to Congress 's Joint Economic Committee . The increase in enrollment is also because it 's easier for eligible families to participate . Federal and state officials as well as Congress , with leadership from both parties , have worked throughout the last decade to simplify SNAP procedures so that the program can reach more eligible households , particularly working families and senior citizens . These efforts are paying off : The share of eligible individuals who participated in SNAP rose from 65 % in 2007 to 72 % in 2009 , the most recent year for which we have the data . The recent growth in SNAP enrollment and spending because of the sluggish economy is temporary . One of SNAP 's great strengths is its ability to respond , quickly and automatically , to changes in the economy : Enrollment grows during downturns but contracts during periods of economic growth . The Congressional Budget Office predicts that SNAP spending will fall in the coming years as the economy recovers more robustly and the temporary benefit increases of the 2009 Recovery Act expire . By 2021 , SNAP is expected to return nearly to pre-recession levels as a share of the economy . Over the long term , SNAP is not growing faster than the economy .

{"answer":"HONG KONG , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hong Kong authorities Sunday announced that two recalled candy products made by British confectioner Cadbury had high levels of melamine . The industrial chemical has recently been found in Chinese-made milk products that have sickened nearly 53,000 children in China , killing four . Countries around the world have since banned the import of Chinese products containing milk , or have withdrawn products that contain milk from China -- such as candy -- amid worries they contain melamine . Last week , Cadbury recalled all of its Chinese-made candy products after preliminary tests showed they contained trace amounts of melamine . Cadbury took the action because `` no level of melamine is appropriate , '' spokesman Tony Bilsborough told CNN on Sunday . He could not comment on the latest test results . The company stresses that its products manufactured at its Beijing plant are only exported to Taiwan and Hong Kong , with one product -- Cadbury Eclair -- sent to Australia , Nauru and Christmas Island . Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety tested 104 samples of products made by a variety of manufacturers , including Cadbury , Nestle , and some U.S. and Chinese companies . Only two of the samples showed unsatisfactory levels of melamine -- Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate -LRB- bulk pack 5kg -RRB- and Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate -LRB- bulk pack 5kg -RRB- . The sample of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate contained melamine levels of 65 ppm -LRB- parts per million -RRB- which is more than 25 times the acceptable level of 2.5 ppm , according to Hong Kong 's government . According to the center , a child weighing 22 pounds -LRB- 10kg -RRB- would have to eat more than 10 small pieces of the hazelnut chocolate to surpass the tolerable daily intake . An average adult weighing 132 pounds -LRB- 60kg -RRB- would have to eat more than 112 small pieces to surpass the level . The melamine levels in the samples of Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate were 6.9 ppm -- more than twice as high as the legal limit of melamine . Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety said it will continue to test dairy products and other products with dairy ingredients . Test results on other products -- including milk powder , soya drinks , yogurt , butter , baby food and frozen confections -- would be released on Monday , it said . Chinese authorities have implicated 22 Chinese dairy companies in the tainted milk scandal . Investigators suspect people watered down milk in an attempt to sell more of it , and added melamine in order to fool quality checks , Chinese authorities have said . The toxic chemical is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk . On Saturday China announced that a test of 607 batches of liquid milk from 27 cities found the samples to be melamine-free , state-run media said . The tests were the sixth Chinese officials have carried out since melamine was discovered in powdered infant formula last month . Chinese authorities have promised to subsidize farmers hit by the shrinking demand for milk , the news agency Xinhua said . Among them is the northern Hebei province , which has earmarked 316 million yuan -LRB- $ 46.1 million -RRB- for subsidies . That translates to giving a farmer 200 yuan -LRB- $ 29 -RRB- per cow , Xinhua said . Melamine is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk . Chinese authorities have arrested 40 people in connection with the scandal , including two brothers who could face the death penalty if convicted . Authorities have implicated 22 Chinese dairy companies in the scandal .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Virginia has n't backed a Democrat for president in 44 years , but economic concerns and changing demographics are giving Sen. Barack Obama a chance to steal the once reliably red state from Republicans . Sen. Barack Obama waves as rain falls on a rally in Fredericksburg , Virginia , in late September . Polls earlier this year showed Sen. John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee , leading Obama , his Democratic rival , in Virginia by a healthy margin . A Virginia Commonwealth University poll taken May 12-18 had McCain leading 47 percent to 39 percent . But as the financial crisis has shaken voters ' confidence in the economy , Obama has begun to open a lead in the state , as he has done in other battleground states . The latest CNN poll of polls has Obama leading McCain 49 percent to 45 percent . A CNN\/TIME\/Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted September 28-30 shows Obama with an even bigger lead over McCain , 53 percent to 44 percent . The CNN poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points . Polls show that voters have more confidence in Obama to handle the economic crisis than they do in McCain , and are more likely to blame Republicans for the recent turmoil than Democrats . Beside an advantage on the economy , Obama is also benefiting from a demographic shift that has reshaped Virginia politics . For the last 10 presidential elections , Republicans have been able to bank on Virginia delivering its 13 electoral votes to the GOP . President Bush won Virginia by 8 percentage points in both 2000 and 2004 , and President Bill Clinton was never able to capture the state when he ran in 1992 and 1996 . But the explosive growth of Northern Virginia in the last decade has changed the state 's electorate . Drawn by government jobs in nearby Washington and high-tech jobs in the Dulles corridor , the growing population in Northern Virginia is more liberal than the mostly rural southern portion of the state , which has remained reliably Republican . In 2000 , Bush carried Northern Virginia 49 percent to 47 percent , but in 2004 , Sen. John Kerry , the Democratic presidential nominee , carried the area 51 percent to 48 percent . Virginia `` is not as red as people think , '' said Doc Thompson , a conservative talk show host for WRVA radio . `` A third of the population in Northern Virginia is pretty liberal . A lot of people are buying into -LSB- Obama 's -RSB- notion of change . '' Virginia Democrats have been able to exploit the changes in the electorate into statewide electoral success after years in which the Republicans had a virtual lock on the state . In fact , Virginia Republicans have not won a statewide race since Mark Warner , a former mobile phone company executive , captured the governorship for the Democrats in 2001 by emphasizing economic growth . Democrat Tim Kaine , who was Warner 's lieutenant governor , succeeded Warner in 2005 . And in what may have been the most surprising result of the 2006 election cycle , Democrat Jim Webb defeated the incumbent Republican George Allen in the race for one of Virginia 's seats in the U.S. Senate . The trend favoring the Democrats is expected to continue this year , which is expected to help drive Virginia Democrats to the polls . The extremely popular Warner is almost certain to win this year 's race against another former governor , Republican Jim Gilmore , to replace Virginia 's long-standing Republican senator , John Warner , who is retiring . -LRB- The two Warners are not related , and John Warner was unopposed in 2002 . -RRB- A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in late September found Warner leading Gilmore by 30 points , and Warner 's victory would give Democrats control of both of Virginia 's seats in the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1970 . While conservatives may be demoralized by Gilmore 's poor showing , McCain may also face eroding support from Virginia conservatives for his recent proposals for the government to become heavily involved in the U.S. economy , said Thompson , the radio talk show host . During Tuesday night 's presidential debate , McCain suggested that the government directly buy up to $ 300 billion in home mortgages to help homeowners facing foreclosure . Thompson said that proposal , along with his support for a $ 700 billion bailout package to help Wall Street firms that McCain voted for last week , are two signs that McCain is breaking from the free-market principles that Virginia conservatives support and not stopping `` the march toward socialism '' that has begun since the economic crisis started . `` They missed a real opportunity , certainly , in Virginia with my listeners who say they want someone who is fiscally conservative , '' said Thompson , who added that he 's considering voting for a third-party candidate . `` They could have come out and said , ` no more spending .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two sheriff 's deputies responding to a domestic dispute between a pair of brothers Monday night were shot and badly injured in the same Washington county where four officers were killed last month , authorities said . The Pierce County deputies were wounded while responding to a domestic violence incident at home near the town of Eatonville , south of Seattle , said Hunter George , a county spokesman . They killed the gunman , identified as David E. Crable , in an exchange of fire , authorities said . Sgt. Nick Hausner , 43 , a 20-year veteran of the Pierce County Sheriff 's Department , was transported to Madigan Army Medical Center where he was in serious condition , the department said . He is married and has children who are 14 and 12 years old . Deputy Kent Mundell , 44 , a nine-year veteran , was airlifted to the trauma center at Harborview Medical Center where he was in critical condition with life-threatening injuries , the sheriff 's department said . He also is married and has two children , a 16-year-old and a 10-year-old . Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said Crable had a history of protection orders sought by family members . Earlier this year , Crable pleaded guilty to malicious mischief and brandishing a knife in an incident involving his brother , Lindquist said , and protection orders were imposed afterward , telling him to stay away from his brother and a female minor . Both counts were misdemeanors . Lindquist said Crable had no felony convictions . The protective orders were not in effect during the Monday night shooting , Lindquist said . The prosecutor said other protection orders that emerged were not the result of charges filed . `` They are a result of people saying this guy is a danger to me , '' Lindquist said . `` I think you can reasonably infer from his history , he had an alcohol problem . '' Crable went to his brother 's house Monday night and there was a domestic dispute , said Sheriff 's detective Ed Troyer . One of the men invited the officers inside the house , while the other man went upstairs . He returned with a weapon and shot at the deputies , striking them several times , Troyer said . Local coverage from CNN affiliate KIRO The deputies returned fire , killing the alleged shooter , he said . `` There were a lot of rounds fired , '' Troyer said . Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire issued a statement saying , `` My thoughts and prayers are with the two wounded Pierce County deputies , their families , friends , and the entire law enforcement community . '' This incident comes in the aftermath of two other recent cop shootings in the Seattle area . Since October 31 , eight police officers or deputies have been shot . Five have died in the attacks . On Halloween night , Seattle police Officer Timothy Brenton was fatally shot while sitting in his patrol car . Brenton , 39 , was reviewing paperwork from a traffic stop when someone fired into his patrol car . An officer Brenton was training was wounded in the shooting . A suspect in that case was arrested and pleaded not guilty . On November 29 , four officers from Lakewood , Washington , were killed in an ambush-style shooting at a coffee shop . Police shot and killed the suspect in that attack after a two-day manhunt . Troyer said it was `` surreal '' to be responding to another shooting that involved officers . His department has led the investigation into the shooting of the four Lakewood officers . `` I am deeply troubled by the recent series of attacks on our law enforcement officers , '' Gregoire said in the statement . `` I ask that all Washington citizens join me in sending a clear message that these assaults on law enforcement officers will not be tolerated . `` The people of Washington and across America know that those who wear a badge show us the true meaning of service . They sacrifice their safety for ours . We owe them and their families our gratitude , respect and support . '' CNN 's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report","question":""}

From left , musicians Tom Petty , Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison 's relatives for dedication of his star . `` There 's someone here from every important stage of George 's life and career , '' Harrison 's widow , Olivia , said . Harrison , who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001 , becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star . John Lennon was the first . The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records , the distributor of much of Harrison 's music for the past five decades . Tuesday 's ceremony coincided with the Capitol\/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison 's first solo greatest hits collection -- `` Let it Roll : Songs by George Harrison '' -- on June 16 . Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song . `` That 's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter , better , more joyful future , '' Hanks said . Superstar musicians Paul McCartney , Tom Petty , Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star 's dedication , but they did not address the crowd . Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event , with some traveling from as far as Liverpool , England . `` We all have deep feelings for George , because he was such a deep-feeling person , '' Olivia Harrison said . `` He was a beautiful , mystical man , living in a material world , '' she said . `` He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing . '' His son , Dhani , 30 , joked about his father 's star . `` It 's good , it 's lovely and it 's nice and shiny and I 'm glad it 's not outside of Frederick 's of Hollywood , '' he said . Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon 's band , the Quarrymen . The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history . Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles . Songs penned by Harrison included `` Taxman , '' `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps , '' `` Something '' and `` Here Comes the Sun . '' Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music . In 1971 , he helped organize the star-studded `` Concert for Bangladesh '' at New York 's Madison Square Garden . In addition to his post-Beatles solo career , Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys , alongside Petty , Lynne , Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- England coach Fabio Capello has been forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup in South Africa . The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form , but has brought Liverpool 's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up . Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello , who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury . Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads . Blog : Will `` the Force '' be with Capello at World Cup ? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004 , but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity . `` He said no , he preferred to stay with the family . But I tried , '' Capello told the UK Press Association . Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury , while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa . Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem , with Tottenham 's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland 's 25-goal Darren Bent . Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence , as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City , who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad . Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod , having last played for England in 2008 , after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea 's first team . Italy 's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad , resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement . Totti 's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero , with Villarreal 's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named . Inter Milan 's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella -LRB- Napoli -RRB- , Vincenzo Iaquinta -LRB- Juventus -RRB- , Antonio Di Natale -LRB- Udinese -RRB- , Marco Borriello -LRB- Milan -RRB- , Alberto Gilardino -LRB- Fiorentina -RRB- and Giampaolo Pazzini -LRB- Sampdoria -RRB- were picked . Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad . France coach Raymond Domenech left out young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema in his 30-man selection , while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira means Thierry Henry is the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad . Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri also missed out , but four of his clubmates in England -- Gael Clichy , William Gallas , Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna -- were included . However , defender Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness , having been sidelined since March with a leg injury . Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk 's 30-man , potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old 's international career . Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury , but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected . `` I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup , '' Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld . `` I believe that Ruud is fit , but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level . '' Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad , which features 14 overseas-based names . Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst , 35 , has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament . Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe , who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December . Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga 's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers , but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists , who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is giving injured stars Andreas Iniesta , Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit , naming the key trio in a 30-man squad including five goalkeepers . Uncapped Barcelona No. 1 Victor Valdes and Atletico Madrid 's 19-year-old David De Gea were selected along with Real Madrid 's Iker Casillas , Liverpool 's Jose Reina and Diego Lopez of Villarreal . Barcelona winger Pedro Rodriguez , Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta and Athletic Bilbao midfielder Javi Martinez were named despite having won only under-21 caps . Barca 19-year-old Bojan Krkic , who missed Spain 's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue , has again been omitted . Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel , Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems . Liverpool 's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot , while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem . Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City , who as loaned to Bolton this season . Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad , with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United . Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad . Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month . Olsen , who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup , gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008 . Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo 's struggles with injuries this season . The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin , Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos . Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld named an experienced 23-man squad for the finals , with seven players in reserve . The German has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente , fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin , who are all 30 and above . Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal , while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An estimated one percent of adults have active epilepsy , and many of them are getting insufficient treatment , according to a 19-state survey released Thursday . `` This is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states , '' said Rosemarie Kobau , lead author of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study , in a telephone interview . `` What we learned is that , among adults with active epilepsy , more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy , and that 's really unacceptable . '' A follow-up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year , Kobau said . `` This is a highly specialized field , '' said Eric Hargis , the president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation , which collaborated with the authors of the study . `` It 's not possible to get state-of-the-art care '' for the disorder from primary care doctors . One in six -LRB- 16.1 percent -RRB- adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two-thirds -LRB- 65.1 percent -RRB- said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month . More than a fifth -LRB- 20.4 percent -RRB- said cost was a barrier to seeking care from their doctor . Access to high-quality care is key to quality of life , Kobau said . People with recurrent seizures face substantial impairments in their daily activities ; many are not allowed to drive and , as a result , depend on public transportation . In some areas , particularly rural ones , that can present a barrier to full participation in life , she said . That 's not all . In addition to carrying stigma , people with epilepsy were more likely to live in households with the lowest annual incomes and to report being unemployed and unable to work . According to the 2005 findings , 1.65 percent of the population said they had been told by a doctor that they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder , the report said . Half of that group -LRB- 0.84 percent -RRB- said they had active epilepsy -- defined as having had one or more seizures during the prior three months or currently taking medication . If the findings translate to the general population , that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active epilepsy , Kobau noted , adding , `` Epilepsy is not rare . '' But that view was disputed by Dr. James King , a family physician in Selmer , Tennessee , and president of the American Association of Family Physicians . `` There are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder , '' he said in a telephone interview . `` In my own personal practice , I 'd say that I can manage at least half , if not more , of the patients that have seizure disorder . '' Many of the others are able to get by with just a one-time visit to a neurologist , said King , whose practice is 50 miles from the nearest neurologist , and 100 miles from the nearest neurologist who accepts Medicaid , the government program for the poor . `` There 's only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist . '' He said financial barriers -- from insurance to the cost of anti-seizure medication -- are a bigger problem . `` If you ca n't afford to buy it -- which is what I run into with a lot of the seizure medicine -- it does n't really matter '' if patients see a neurologist or a family physician , he said . Many patients , forced to choose between paying their light bill or taking their anti-seizure medication , choose the former , King said . Epilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain malfunctions , causing recurrent seizures -- electrical storms in the brain -- that can be characterized by a range of symptoms , including sudden change in awareness , movement or sensation . Each year , about 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease , as was Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after he suffered a seizure last year at his Maine vacation home . `` Many people with epilepsy do lead normal , productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder , '' Kobau said . The study , conducted by the federal government and published in the CDC 's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , estimates that 2.7 million people in the United States have epilepsy , and that it costs some $ 15.5 billion in medical care and lost or reduced earnings or productivity each year . Hargis said the incidence of the disorder is expected to climb among veterans returning from Iraq or Afghanistan , where head injuries are common . `` When you have a head injury , it 's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years , '' he said . And the aging population is also expected to boost the incidence of epilepsy . Conditions of aging , such as stroke and Alzheimer 's Disease , are also associated with a higher incidence of epilepsy . The study was based on data from more than 120,000 adults in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System .","question":""}
{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the same day he was released from a hospital after undergoing a heart procedure , former President Clinton told reporters he has no plans to slow down . `` I have to keep working -- that 's what my life is for , '' he said outside his home in Chappaqua , New York , on Friday . `` You know I was given a good mind , a strong body , a wonderful life and it would be wrong for me not to work . '' `` I even did a couple of miles -LSB- walking -RSB- on the treadmill today , '' he said . On Thursday , Clinton , 63 , underwent a procedure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital 's Columbia campus to implant two stents in a clogged coronary artery . Clinton has `` no evidence of heart attack or damage to his heart , '' and his prognosis is excellent after undergoing the procedure , according to Dr. Allan Schwartz , the hospital 's chief of cardiology . Schwartz said the procedure was `` part of the natural history '' of Clinton 's treatment after his 2004 quadruple bypass surgery and `` not a result of either his lifestyle or diet , both of which have been excellent . '' Have you gone through heart surgery ? Share your story . Clinton called the procedure `` kind of a repair job '' and said he 's `` actually doing very well . '' He said he began feeling tired around Christmas and traveled several times in recent weeks to Europe and Haiti . `` I did n't really notice it until about four days ago when I felt a little bit of pain in my chest , and I thought I had to check it out , '' he said . Earlier Friday , Clinton , the U.N. special envoy for Haiti , issued a statement marking the passing of one month since a massive earthquake devastated the impoverished nation . He also has visited the island nation twice since the earthquake , a fact he noted on Friday . `` I will continue to work with the Haitian government and people , international donors and multilateral organizations , the Haitian Diaspora , NGOs -LSB- nongovernmental organizations -RSB- , and the international business community to fulfill unmet needs , '' Clinton said in the statement , released Friday . `` Haiti still has a chance to escape the chains of the past and the ruins of the earthquake , '' he said . `` But we all will have to do what we can today . '' Clinton said he had helped collect 200,000 donations for Haiti through his partnership with former President George W. Bush -- the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund -- and through the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund , calling those efforts `` especially impressive . '' He said he has helped allocate $ 7 million in relief . The 7.0-magnitude quake of January 12 leveled most of Port-au-Prince , Haiti 's capital , killing more than 212,000 people and injuring 300,000 , according to Haitian government estimates . It left more than a million homeless . Clinton underwent a procedure called angioplasty , the hospital said , in which a balloon catheter is threaded through an artery to the blocked vessel in the heart . When inflated , the balloon opens the vessel and restores blood flow . Many times , a scaffolding-like structure called a stent is left in place to keep the artery open . How stents open arteries President Obama called Clinton on Thursday evening and wished him a speedy recovery so he can continue his work on Haiti and other humanitarian efforts , a senior administration official said . Schwartz said Clinton began experiencing `` pressure or constriction '' in his chest several days ago , episodes he described as `` brief in nature but repetitive . '' An initial electrocardiogram and blood test showed no evidence of heart attack , Schwartz said . Subsequent pictures of Clinton 's arteries revealed that one of the bypass grafts from his 2004 surgery was `` completely blocked , '' prompting the stent procedure , which took about an hour , Schwartz said . Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after the surgery . Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea , and his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , were with him at the hospital Thursday night , Schwartz said . Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East , but her departure has been delayed until Saturday , a senior U.S. official said . Bill Clinton has maintained an active schedule since leaving the White House in 2001 , devoting much of his time to global philanthropic interests and speeches . Friends have expressed concerns that his `` frenetic pace '' was taking a toll on his health , sources told CNN . Clinton maintained that frenetic schedule all the way up to the surgery , said Terry McAuliffe , a longtime Clinton friend and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee . In fact , as doctors were wheeling Clinton into the operating room , Clinton 's phone had to be taken out of his hand , said McAuliffe . `` He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti , '' McAuliffe told CNN Friday morning . `` And I guarantee as soon as he gets back today he 's going to be back on the phone . He 's passionate about helping the folks down there . '' In addition to his trips to Haiti , Clinton attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January . David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst , said Clinton was exhausted and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month . But Schwartz stressed Thursday that Clinton 's lifestyle has nothing to do with his hospitalization . `` He has really toed the line in terms of both diet and exercise , '' Schwartz said , adding that he told Clinton he could be back in the office Monday . Dr. Spencer King , who has not treated Clinton , rejected as outdated suggestions that the former president needs to slow down . `` This is kind of a '50s concept , '' he said Thursday . `` Now we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done . The outlook for people is totally different . '' `` If he slows down , he slows down , '' said King , president of St. Joseph 's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta , Georgia . But he added , `` It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up . '' Clinton 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday . Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery . Schwartz said Thursday that the type of bypass graft used in Clinton 's 2004 surgery `` has a 10 -LSB- percent -RSB- to 20 percent failure rate after five or six years . '' King said Thursday 's stent procedure may not be the end of Clinton 's heart woes . `` The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease , and sometimes it goes on and develops more , '' he said . `` There 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again .

Unlike other gums that contain petrochemicals the natural gum is produced from the sap of the chicozapote tree found in the Mexican rainforest , a spokesman for Chicza told CNN . A spokesman for campaign group Keep Britain Tidy told CNN they welcome any product that can help eradicate the staining on pavements caused by dropped chewing gum . Removing chewing gum litter costs local authorities # 150 million -LRB- $ 222 million -RRB- a year , a spokesman for the Local Government Association told CNN . Sixty-five percent of British streets have chewing gum stuck on them , a spokesman from Keep Britain Tidy told CNN . One of the worst-affected areas is Westminster in central London , where a comprehensive gum clean-up would cost # 9 million -LRB- $ 13.4 million -RRB- , according to Westminster City Council . `` Gum litter is a constant problem for us , especially given the vast number of visitors to Westminster every day . We spend # 100,000 -LRB- $ 148,000 -RRB- a year cleaning ugly blobs of conventional chewing gum off our streets , '' Westminster City Councilor Danny Chalkley said in a written statement . `` It 's an incredibly expensive and time-consuming task , so anything that could reduce the problem is very welcome indeed . '' he said . British parliamentarians have called on the government to introduce a tax on chewing gum , with the money raised going toward the cost of gum removal . In Britain , offenders can be fined up to # 80 -LRB- $ 119 -RRB- for discarding used chewing gum on a street . The producer of the new gum is Consorcio Chiclero , which comprises 46 cooperatives with around 2,000 chicleros farmers , working in an area of 1.3 million hectares of rainforest , according to a statement from Chicza . Locals have been extracting the natural chicle gum base from the bark of the chicozapote trees for a century , a spokesman for Chicza told CNN . After years of exporting the gum base to be used as an ingredient in the manufacture of regular chewing gum , the cooperative recently decided to start making its own gum using only chicle gum base and natural flavorings and sweeteners , Chicza said . The company launched its gum in Britain this week . It is available at a chain of supermarkets and Mexican restaurants . The Chicza gum sells for # 1.39 -LRB- $ 2.06 -RRB- for a pack of 12 squares .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexican and Colombian officials working with U.S. agents have seized about $ 41 million in cash hidden in shipping containers , the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency announced Monday . Colombian authorities seized $ 11.2 million in U.S. currency in Buenaventura , Colombia , on September 9 . The U.S. agency , commonly called ICE , says the seizures were made September 9-18 . It called them the largest seizure of cash ever found in shipping containers destined for Colombia and the largest for the agency since its inception . According to ICE : \u2022 On September 9 , Colombian customs inspectors and Colombian national police , acting on intelligence reports , seized $ 11.2 million in U.S. currency hidden in two shipping containers . The containers were aboard a vessel that sailed from the Port of Manzanillo , Mexico , and was headed to Buenaventura , Colombia . Colombian customs inspectors said it was the most cash ever seized by police at a port in the nation . \u2022 On September 10 , a second seizure of U.S. currency estimated at $ 11.2 million also was made at the Buenaventura port . \u2022 On September 11 , a shipment of $ 11 million was discovered hidden inside two shipping containers at the Port of Manzanillo . \u2022 On September 14 , ICE special agents , along with Colombian authorities , discovered three additional shipping containers in Buenaventura containing about $ 5 million in $ 100 and $ 50 bills . These shipping containers also originated in Manzanillo . \u2022 On September 18 , authorities seized $ 2.15 million in $ 100 bills concealed inside two containers aboard a vessel that arrived in Manzanillo . `` This seizure represents a bad day for organized crime , '' ICE Director John Morton said at a Monday news conference in Washington . `` Forty-one million dollars is not a rounding error . The loss of that kind of money hurts . '' All of the money was concealed in sacks of fertilizer chemicals in containers transported on commercial ships , Morton said . Watch investigators uncover cash '' `` When it 's packed in very large containers , it 's extremely difficult to probe ; it 's extremely difficult to X-ray . And so it was a very good means of concealing currency , '' he said . The ports of Buenaventura and Manzanillo are key points along a well-known route used for smuggling cocaine northward to Mexico and then on to the United States , and for sending cash back into Colombia , where most of the cocaine originates , ICE said in a news release . Morton called the smugglers `` very , very sophisticated , '' saying they were using the lawful shipping trade to send drug profits from the U.S. through Mexico to Colombia . Morton said the money will be forfeited in accordance with the laws of the nations where it was seized , with Colombia keeping $ 28 million and Mexico getting $ 13 million . `` None of these monies will be forfeited to the United States , '' he said . While large , this month 's cash seizure is not a record . In March of 2007 , officials in Mexico officials confiscated $ 207 million in cash in what was then called the largest drug-related cash seizure in history . ICE is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security , investigating financial crime , trade fraud , narcotics smuggling and cash smuggling , the agency said . ICE was established in 2003 after the Homeland Security Act of 2002 . CNN 's Mike M. Ahlers and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Editor 's note : Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health . Dr. Anthony S. Fauci : Progress has been made in the fight against HIV\/AIDS , but `` our work is just beginning . '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When we commemorated the first World AIDS Day on December 1 , 1988 , we had little to celebrate . The number of reported AIDS cases in the United States was nearing 80,000 and rising rapidly . Untold thousands more in this country were living with the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV . Globally , AIDS cases already had been reported from more than 135 countries . An AIDS tsunami clearly was looming , but we had few defenses at our disposal . For those of us caring for people with AIDS , it was a dark time . We had just one anti-HIV medicine in our pharmacies , AZT , a drug that the virus rapidly defeated by mutating and developing resistance . Lacking other medicines to slow the relentless replication of HIV and its destruction of a person 's immune system , we did our best to help our patients by managing to the extent possible their AIDS-related infections and complications . But the life span of most of the patients was measured in months . Two decades later , much has changed . An unprecedented research effort has led to more than two dozen anti-HIV drugs , more than for all other viral diseases combined . Taken in proper combinations , these medications have dramatically improved the prognosis for people living with HIV by increasing their life span by at least a decade and providing the possibility of a normal life span with continued therapy . Scientifically proven prevention approaches -- education and outreach to at-risk populations , voluntary HIV testing and counseling , condom distribution , prevention of HIV transmission from mother to baby , harm reduction approaches for drug abusers , mass-media campaigns and the screening of donated blood -- have been deployed with great success in the United States and many other countries . Innovative programs such as the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund for HIV\/AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , as well as the efforts of nongovernment organizations , have reached millions of people in low - and mid-income countries worldwide with HIV-related services , at a scale unimaginable a few years ago . And gradually -- but too slowly -- we have begun addressing AIDS-related stigma in this country and abroad . Much has been accomplished in the fight against HIV\/AIDS from scientific , medical and public health standpoints . However , now is no time to rest on our accomplishments or our laurels . The statistics of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic tell us that much more needs to be done . Around the world , a staggering 2.7 million people were infected in 2007 alone . Globally , 33 million people are living with HIV infection , most of them in the developing world . In the United States , more than 1 million people are living with HIV . And 56,000 more people are infected each year in the U.S. , driving HIV prevalence rates in some of our communities to levels that rival those seen in sub-Saharan Africa . Gay and bisexual men , and African-Americans in general , are disproportionately affected . The true ground zero of the HIV epidemic in the United States is in those communities . What is the way forward ? First , even in the face of a world economic crisis , the global community must scale up the delivery of proven HIV therapies and prevention services . In low - and middle-income countries , less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it , and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services . All around the world , access to HIV services -- and medical care in general -- remains a challenge in many poor communities . The global community must sustain our commitment to investing resources for medicines , clinics , as well as training and salaries for doctors , nurses and community health care workers to provide care for HIV\/AIDS and other diseases in the settings where they occur . Here in the United States , more than one-fifth of people living with HIV are unaware of their infection and not receiving appropriate care for their own health or the prevention services that would help them avoid transmitting the virus to others . A frequent scenario is that people learn of their infection status only when they have advanced symptoms of HIV disease , when their health may by irreparably damaged . Now is the time for the medical community and policymakers to embrace U.S. guidelines for all Americans aged 13-64 to be voluntarily tested in routine medical care . Barriers to implementation of HIV testing guidelines , such as state , local or agency regulations that conflict with the recommendations , variability in payment coverage for the test , and concerns about the stigma and discrimination that may accompany an HIV diagnosis , must be addressed . Meanwhile , we also must continue to invest in the next generation of treatment and prevention modalities . Encouragingly , new means of preventing HIV infection are emerging from well-designed and well-implemented clinical research trials . One exciting concept is pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP , giving preventive doses of anti-HIV drugs to individuals who are at an increased risk of HIV infection . This still-experimental strategy is based on the concept that if HIV replication can be inhibited immediately following exposure to the virus , permanent infection might be thwarted . Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world . Ongoing research to develop microbicidal gels or creams to be applied before sex offer the hope of people being able to protect themselves from HIV infection in situations where saying no to sex or insisting on condom use is not an option . Finally , a preventive HIV vaccine remains the greatest hope for halting the relentless spread of HIV\/AIDS . We must solve the mystery of how to prompt the human body to produce a protective immune response against HIV , which natural infection with the virus seems unable to do . Historically , it has taken decades to find effective vaccines to combat most infectious diseases . Researchers usually experienced numerous setbacks and disappointments before reaching success , yet they persevered . Finding a safe and effective HIV vaccine demands an equally intense resolve . On this World AIDS Day , we should be proud of the many scientific advances that have been made in the fight against HIV\/AIDS . But it is hardly a time for self-congratulation . Rather , we must understand that our work is just beginning . Developing HIV interventions and delivering them to the people who need them will require scientific and public health vision , and dedication from all sectors of society , in good times and bad . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci .","question":""}

{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of two doctors charged with conspiring to furnish drugs to Anna Nicole Smith before her fatal overdose in 2007 surrendered to authorities and was jailed Monday , authorities said . Anna Nicole Smith 's boyfriend Howard K. Stern was among those charged last week . Dr. Khristine Eroshevich surrendered at the Van Nuys , California , jail , said police and jail officials . Bail was set at $ 20,000 , but Eroshevich had not posted bail as of Monday afternoon . Eroshevich was charged last week along with Howard K. Stern , Smith 's longtime partner and attorney ; and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor . Stern and Kapoor were arrested and released from a Los Angeles County jail Thursday night after each posted a $ 20,000 bond . All three are charged with eight felonies , including conspiring to furnish controlled substances , unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 , only weeks before Smith 's death . Kapoor and Eroshevich were also charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by `` fraud , deceit or misrepresentation . '' And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address , prosecutors said . `` Anna was the center of a cruel tabloid feeding frenzy , '' Eroshevich 's attorney , Adam Braun , told CNN in a statement Monday . `` In the face of this , Dr. Eroshevich did her best to help the patient while protecting what little privacy Anna had left . Any actions were done with the patient 's well-being in mind and were certainly not criminal . '' California Attorney General Jerry Brown said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed `` thousands of pills . '' The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star was drugged `` almost to the point of stupefaction , '' Brown said . `` The quantity of the drugs , the variety of the drugs , the combination at any given point , and her continuing to use that -- that , to a professional , is clear evidence of addiction , '' Brown said Friday . `` These cocktails of methadone and antidepressants and sleeping pills and Xanax , you put all that into a cocktail , it explodes and can cause death , injury and permanent morbidity and disability .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April , according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization . A young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi . Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week . As of July 31 , the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus , also known as swine flu , stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO 's previous update on July 27 . The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed , spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months , according to WHO . WHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380 , but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported . The total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168 , with new cases reported in Azerbaijan , Gabon , Grenada , Kazakhstan , Moldova , Monaco , Nauru , Swaziland and Suriname . In the United States , federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season . They say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus , but it wo n't be as simple as a single shot . In a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday , two senior administration officials said the vaccine , which is still in clinical trials , would require two shots . The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later . Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that . That means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October wo n't get protection until late fall . On Tuesday , British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies . GlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $ 250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization . `` First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards , with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 , '' GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement . `` The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain . '' Details of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government 's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season . The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain , identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations . The priority groups include pregnant women , health care and emergency services personnel , children , adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age , household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions . The symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever , cough , sore throat , aches and runny nose , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Austrian man who participated in a Nazi massacre of Jews during World War II and later gained U.S. citizenship has been deported to Austria , U.S. officials said . The Sachsenhausen concentration camp just north of Berlin where the U.S. says Krumpf worked as an SS guard . Josias Krumpf , 83 , lived for years after the war in Racine , Wisconsin . The United States revoked his citizenship in 2005 after the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice sought to denaturalize him . Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita Glavin announced Krumpf 's deportation Thursday . It was not clear when he arrived in Austria , and representatives of the Austrian Justice Ministry were not immediately available for comment . `` His court-ordered removal from the United States to Austria is another milestone in the government 's long-running effort to ensure that individuals who participated in crimes against humanity do not find sanctuary in this country , '' Glavin said . The United States removed Krumpf because of his participation in that and other Nazi-sponsored acts of persecution during the war , Glavin said . Krumpf admits standing watch on November 3 , 1943 , as SS guards at the Trawniki Labor Camp in Poland shot and killed 8,000 Jews , including women and 400 children , in pits . Glavin said Krumpf said he had orders to shoot any prisoners who survived . Krumpf also served as an SS guard at the Nazi-run Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in Germany and at slave labor sites in Nazi-occupied France , where prisoners under his watch built launching platforms for German missile attacks on England , Glavin said . The November 1943 shooting was part of a larger Nazi operation called `` Aktion Erntefest , '' or `` Operation Harvest Festival , '' that led to the deaths of 42,000 Jews at three camps in eastern Poland in two days , the Justice Department said . At Trawniki , Krumpf said , he was assigned to watch for victims who were still `` halfway alive '' or `` convulsing '' and prevent their escape by shooting them to death , the Justice Department said . Krumpf , who was born in Serbia , immigrated to the United States in 1956 and became a U.S. citizen in 1964 . His removal to Austria is part of an effort by several U.S. government departments and law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute participants in Nazi crimes of persecution who live in the United States , the Justice Department said . The Criminal Division 's Office of Special Investigations -LRB- OSI -RRB- started the operation in 1979 and has since won cases against 107 alleged Nazi criminals , the Justice Department said . The OSI also has a watch list for World War II war criminals that has prevented the entry of more than 180 people into the United States , the Justice Department said .","question":""}

Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising . New Zealand , 41 for two overnight , lost nightwatchman Shane Bond , bowled by a Steyn yorker , before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming , who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip . Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled . Steyn 's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago . It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11 . South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply , but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge . They batted together for 205 minutes , Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76 . The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum 's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond , when the batsman had only scored two . `` The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum . It cost us a lot , '' said coach John Bracewell . E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"Children and teens who have a parent with bipolar disorder are 14 times more likely than their peers to have bipolar-like symptoms themselves , and are two to three times more likely to be found to have an anxiety or mood disorder , such as depression , according to a report in the March issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry . More than 10 percent of the kids with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar-spectrum , mood or anxiety disorder . When both parents are bipolar , children are 3.6 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than children with only one parent with the psychiatric condition . Bipolar disorder , which is also known as manic-depressive illness , affects 5.7 million people over age 18 in the United States . The condition is characterized by extreme fluctuations in energy , mood , and the ability to function . For example , someone experiencing an `` episode '' may have a manic state of euphoria for a period of time , followed by a bout of severe depression . Although bipolar disorder may run in families , it 's not guaranteed that children of bipolar parents will develop the condition too . `` I do n't want parents to think ' I have bipolar , so my kids have bipolar , ' '' says Boris Birmaher , M.D. , of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and author of the new study , called the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study . `` Yes , these kids are at a higher risk , but that does n't necessarily mean your child will have it . '' Health.com : Bipolar disorder is different for women In the study , Birmaher and colleagues looked at 233 parents with bipolar disorder and their 388 children , ages 6 to 18 . They were compared with a control group of 143 parents and 251 children with no family history of the condition . Overall , 10.6 percent of the children with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar spectrum disorder -LRB- which includes a range of symptoms from severe to less so -RRB- or a mood or anxiety disorder . In comparison , only two children , or 0.8 percent , in the control group had such symptoms . It 's not clear whether genes , environment or a combination of both are responsible for the link , or possibly greater awareness and diagnosis of psychiatric conditions in bipolar families . Health.com : How a bipolar patient learned to manage mania However , Birmaher says identifying the condition at an earlier age may ultimately help young people . `` The longer you wait , the more complicated the condition could become , '' Birmaher says . Previous studies have suggested that it can take 10 years of symptoms before people get a correct diagnosis and proper treatment . `` Ten years is a long time -- especially in the life of a child , '' he says . The condition is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be mistaken for depression , attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder or one of the disruptive behavior disorders . Signs of a manic episode include increased energy , extreme irritability , racing thoughts , spending sprees , abuse of drugs -LRB- particularly cocaine -RRB- , and increased sexual drive . A depressive episode may range from disruptive sleeping patterns to thoughts of death or suicide . `` The chronic highs and lows are only two manifestations of the condition , '' says Gary Sachs , M.D. , director of the bipolar clinic and research program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . `` But there are plenty of people who live a full , functional life and still have bipolar disorder . '' Health.com : How to care for and cope with a bipolar spouse Bipolar disorder can not be cured , and is treated with mood-stabilizing medications like lithium , as well as psychotherapy , and psychosocial intervention . The ongoing study will follow this group of parents and children to explore further bipolar triggers including stress , family interactions , and genetics . Health.com : My story : I 'm bipolar and struggle with addiction `` This study in no way should be a reason for someone with bipolar not to have children , '' says Sachs . `` But there is a risk and that might make someone 's child who has difficulty seek help sooner . '' In adults with bipolar disorder , up to 60 percent say they had their first symptoms before the age of 21 . `` Bipolar disorder is a multidimensional condition , and it can affect a lot of things including your physical health , '' says Sachs . `` That is what we are learning from studies like this where you begin to see other psychiatric conditions . '' The National Institute of Mental Health funded the study . Birmaher has participated in pharmaceutical company-sponsored forums and a study co-author has served on the advisory boards of several pharmaceutical companies .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 6.4-magnitude earthquake jolted southern Taiwan on Thursday morning , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths but some damage has occurred to buildings and major bridges , and power was cut off near the epicenter . The quake struck at about 8:20 a.m. -LRB- 7:20 p.m. Wednesday ET -RRB- in a mountainous region about 25 miles northwest of Taitung , on the southeast coast , and 40 miles east of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast . The region , which includes Maolin National Scenic Area , is recovering from a direct hit by Typhoon Morakot that killed hundreds in August . The typhoon dumped more than two feet of rain , causing serious mudslides in the south , including one that buried the village of Shiao Lin under 50 feet of mud . Thursday 's quake was followed by several aftershocks , the largest reaching 4.8 . The initial 6.4 quake rumbled to the surface from 14 miles deep . Were you there ? Did you feel it ? The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off near the epicenter but had no further information . Residents in southern Taiwan reported cracks in some buildings and major bridges . Train service was also disrupted in some areas , Taiwanese media reported . Albert Yu , communications manager of the humanitarian organization World Vision , told CNN he was about halfway through a 90-minute trip via high-speed train from Taipei to Tainan when the quake struck . Passengers did not feel the quake , he said , but operators stopped the train and announced what had happened . More than an hour later , the train had not resumed its journey . `` The operator is examining the train and the tracks , '' he said , adding that there was a concern about the stability of the area , particularly after the typhoon . `` Inside the train , people are calm and are waiting it out -- opening laptops , starting to work and chatting with people around them . '' Yu said World Vision `` has already been on high alert responding to the quakes in Haiti and Chile , so we 're closely monitoring reports in the earthquake in southern Taiwan . '' Residents in the capital Taipei , 155 miles to the north , also felt the shaking . Earthquakes are not uncommon in the 13,892-square-mile island -- about the size of the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined -- which sits across the juncture of the Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates . A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the same general region in December . The island took a double hit on December 26 , 2006 , when earthquakes of 7.1 and 6.9 magnitude hit eight minutes apart . The largest recorded quake to strike Taiwan was an 8.0-magnitude quake in 1920 , but the worst earthquake disaster stemmed from a 7.1-magnitude quake in 1935 that killed more than 3,200 people -- followed by a 6.5-magnitude quake that killed more than 2,700 people three months later . More recently , a 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in 1999 . CNN 's Christine Theodorou and Journalist Andrew Lee contributed to this report","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan and Roma played out a goalless draw in Italy 's Serie A in a result which does little to enhance the title ambitions of neither side . The result left Inter Milan three points clear at the top of the table and they will be able to increase that lead to six if they claim victory over Genoa at the San Siro on Sunday night . Roma began the brighter of the two sides and Cristian Abiatti saved well from a Julio Baptista shot while Daniele De Rossi screwed a shot wide when well placed . The visitors were much improved after the half-time break and controlled possession but were unable to create many chances although Marco Borriello squandered a good chance when he opted to shoot instead of passing to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar . John-Arne Riise 's dangerous cross was met by the head of Mirko Vucinic in the 74th minute but the Montenegro striker was unable to direct his attempt on goal . Brazilian Ronaldinho also went close with a header from David Beckham 's cross in the dying stages as the match ended in a stalemate . In Saturday 's other game Juventus moved back into the top four in Serie A thanks to a narrow 2-1 victory over Fiorentina at the Stadio Artemio Franchi . The Turin giants were under pressure following a defeat to Palermo last weekend and coach Alberto Zaccheroni got the response he requested from his players . Juventus took the lead through Brazilian playmaker Diego in only the second minute of the game when he took the ball round Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastian Frey and fired home after collecting an intelligent through-ball from Antonio Candreva . Fiorentina responded positively and gained a deserved equalizer when former Juventus midfielder Marco Marchionni headed past stand-in goalkeeper Alex Manninger in the 32nd minute . Marchionni then missed a chance to put his side ahead moments before the break when he fired a shot when well placed inside the penalty area . Juventus improved after the interval and David Trezeguet tested Frey with a volley before the visitors took the lead for the second time in the 68th minute when Fabio Grosso crashed a shot into the top corner . Zaccheroni 's side could have extended their advantage in injury time but a superb double save from Frey denied Claudio Marchisio .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former GOP presidential nominee John McCain warned Wednesday that the United States is losing the war in Afghanistan . Sen. John McCain recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops . The Arizona senator , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that while he approved of President Obama 's recent decision to send 17,000 more troops to the country , he believed an additional allied military and civilian surge would be necessary to prevent it from once again becoming an al Qaeda safe haven . The Obama administration is conducting a review of overall U.S. policy in the troubled Islamic republic , the president said in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday . `` With our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism , '' Obama said Tuesday . `` Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world . We will not allow it . '' But McCain said on Wednesday , `` When you are n't winning in this kind of war , you are losing . And , in Afghanistan today , we are not winning . '' He delivered his remarks at the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington-based think tank . McCain claimed that while the situation in Afghanistan is `` nowhere near as dire as it was in Iraq , '' the number of insurgent attacks had spiked in 2008 and violence had increased more than 500 percent in the past four years . Growing portions of the country `` suffer under the influence of the Taliban , '' he added . McCain 's comments echoed those of Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who acknowledged last Friday that the United States is facing a `` very tough test '' in Afghanistan . `` But I 'm sure we will rise to the occasion the way we have many times before , '' Gates told a news conference in Krakow , Poland , where NATO defense ministers were meeting . McCain said that the U.S. was winning the war in Afghanistan through early 2005 , when some troops were withdrawn and `` our integrated civil-military command structure was disassembled and replaced by a Balkanized and dysfunctional arrangement . '' A Vietnam War veteran , former prisoner of war and longtime member of the Armed Services Committee , McCain said that while he knows Americans `` are weary of war ... we must win -LSB- in Afghanistan -RSB- . The alternative is to risk that country 's return to its previous function as a terrorist sanctuary , from which al Qaeda could train and plan attacks against America . '' Among other things , McCain stated that the U.S. needs to establish a larger military headquarters capable of executing `` the necessary planning and coordination for a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign . '' He also said plans to expand the Afghan army from 68,000 to 134,000 troops were insufficient . He recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops . At the same time , he said , the U.S. needs to boost the country 's nonmilitary assistance to help strengthen `` its -LSB- civilian -RSB- institutions , the rule of law , and the economy in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the drug trade . '' Southern Afghanistan provides about two thirds of the world 's opium and heroin . Over the years , those two drugs have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency , including the Taliban . McCain warned that , even if his recommendations are adopted , the violence in Afghanistan is `` likely to get worse before it gets better . The scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous . '' The timetable , he concluded , `` will be measured in years , not months . ''","question":""}

{"answer":"Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The American missionaries in Haiti facing kidnapping charges for trying to take 33 children out of the country last week made an earlier , unsuccessful attempt at taking dozens of other children , a Haitian police officer said . The officer did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals . He told CNN on Monday that he had stopped the 10 Baptist missionaries , including group leader Laura Silsby , on January 26 as they tried to transport 40 children from Haiti to the Dominican Republic . The officer said he discovered Silsby and the nine other Americans on a bus in Port-au-Prince 's P\u00e9tionville neighborhood after receiving a tip from a concerned citizen . He stopped the group and ordered the children to get off the bus . He then directed Silsby to the Dominican Embassy . `` I said what happened , and she -LSB- Silsby -RSB- told me , ' I have the paperwork to cross the Haitian-Dominican border with 100 children , ' '' the officer said . A former attorney for the group , Edwin Coq , said the officer has testified of his account . Prosecutors questioned the officer last week in the case against the missionaries . Prosecutors no longer suspect him of any wrongdoing , and he is now a witness , according Coq , who is familiar with the prosecution 's case file . The police officer 's superiors also confirmed his version of events . Attorneys for the Americans did not immediately answer calls for comment . Full coverage of the earthquake 's aftermath The 10 missionaries were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti . Earlier Monday , Jorge Puello , a Dominican attorney who said he was hired to represent the group , said they had authorization from the Dominican Republic to bring the children across the border . Puello showed reporters a manila folder he said contained documents that prove the Americans had authorization to bring the children into the Dominican Republic , but he did not show the documents to reporters . Dominican authorities have said the Americans did not have permission , and Puello did not say whether the group had the authorization of Haitian officials . The Americans have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after January 12 's magnitude-7 .0 earthquake , which has left more than 200,000 dead . iReport : Looking for loved ones in Haiti Arriving outside the Haitian attorney general 's office Monday , Puello said a church hired him that counts some of the jailed Americans among its members . He did not identify the congregation . Coq announced over the weekend that he had resigned . Puello said Monday that Coq had been fired but gave no details . Some of the Americans have said they thought they were helping orphans , but their interpreters said this week that they were present when group members spoke with some of the children 's parents . Some parents in a village outside Port-au-Prince said they had willingly given their children to the Americans , who promised them a better life . The parents also said they had been told they could see their children whenever they wanted . But the Dominican consul general has said he warned the group 's leader , Silsby , about trying to cross the border without proper documents . Silsby and four other Americans arrived for an appearance before an examining judge Monday . One of them , Paul Thomson , referred reporters to a passage in the New Testament book of 1 Corinthians , in which the apostle Paul tells early Christians , `` It seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession , like men condemned to die in the arena . '' The passage continues , `` To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty , we are in rags , we are brutally treated , we are homeless . We work hard with our own hands . When we are cursed , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure it ; when we are slandered , we answer kindly . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr will reunite on stage next month to raise money to teach transcendental meditation to children around the world to `` help provide them a quiet haven in a not-so-quiet world , '' McCartney said . Paul McCartney -LRB- above -RRB- and Ringo Starr are teaming up for a fund-raising concert . The star-studded list of performers who will join them include two musicians who were with the Beatles when they journeyed to India 's Himalayan foothills in 1968 to learn transcendental meditation from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . `` In moments of madness , it has helped me find moments of serenity , '' McCartney said in the concert announcement . Profits from the April 4 show at New York 's Radio City Music Hall will fund the David Lynch Foundation 's program , which has already taught 60,000 children around the world how to meditate , foundation spokesman Steve Yellin said . The goal of the project -- which is called `` Change Begins Within '' -- is to teach the meditation technique to a million at-risk children so they have `` life-long tools to overcome stress and violence and promote peace and success in their lives , '' Yellin said . Schools across the United States have asked the group to bring the classes to their students , he said . `` I would like to think that it would help provide them a quiet haven in a not-so-quiet world , '' McCartney said . Singer-songwriter Donovan and musician Paul Horn , who studied at the Maharishi 's ashram with the four Beatles , will also perform in the show . `` How great to be playing with Paul , Ringo , and Paul Horn again -- as we did in India in 1968 , '' Donovan said . `` It 's a real reunion after 40 years of Donovan , Paul Horn , Ringo and Paul McCartney , '' Yellin said . `` It 's quite an interesting thing that they are still talking about transcendental meditation . '' Ringo left the ashram after just 10 days -- explaining the food was too spicy for his taste -- and McCartney stayed for six weeks , according to journalist Lewis Lapham in his book `` With the Beatles . '' McCartney and John Lennon wrote many of the songs for the Beatles ' White Album while there , but the group disbanded within two years .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The announced pregnancy of Jamie Lynn Spears -- the 16-year-old children 's television star and younger sister of beleaguered pop star Britney Spears -- is casting new light on how states deal with the thorny issue of consensual sex among teens . Jamie Lynn Spears , shown in September , stars in the popular Nickelodeon series `` Zoey 101 . '' Spears , the star of Nickelodeon 's `` Zoey 101 , '' told OK! Magazine that she 's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend . There has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case . Consensual sex between the two may well have been legal , depending on where and when it took place . But critics of the nation 's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries . Watch CNN 's Sunny Hostin on what the law says '' `` You have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced , '' said Jonathan Turley , a law professor at George Washington University . `` I have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children , but I have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships . `` What this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases . '' Watch a psychologist talk about how Spears ' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex '' In Louisiana , where Spears lives , it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years . In California , where she sometimes tapes her television show , it 's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older . Someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony . According to OK! Magazine , which first reported the news Tuesday , Spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend Casey Aldridge . Turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them . But that 's a recipe for legal problems , he said . The issue drew international attention when a Georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17 . In 2005 , Genarlow Wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party . While he was found not guilty of that charge , he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older . Georgia law , which has since been changed , required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required Wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released . Under the revised Georgia law , the act now would be a misdemeanor . Now 21 , Wilson was released from prison in October -- after serving more than two years -- when the state Supreme Court ruled his sentence was `` grossly disproportionate to his crime . '' `` The current laws leave too much to prosecutorial discretion , '' Turley said . `` We saw in the Wilson case how prosecutorial discretion can lead to grotesque results . '' He said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in Southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere in the country or in big cities . B.J. Bernstein , Wilson 's attorney , argued throughout his case that Wilson was imprisoned for an act that , while perhaps morally questionable , probably is going on among teens everywhere . `` If you prosecuted , even with misdemeanors , all those cases , you 'd clog up the justice system with kids having sex , '' she said . `` It 's a social issue -- and it may be something that parents do n't want to happen or wish would n't happen at that age -- but it should n't be a crime . '' Spears , who turned 16 on April 4 and says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy , told the magazine she plans to raise her child in Louisiana , `` so it can have a normal family life . '' Nickelodeon released a statement saying the network respects Spears ' decision `` to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation . '' E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Sri Lankan army launched an operation against Tamil rebels in the country 's north early Monday , the military said , claiming to have rescued thousands of civilians trapped in a government safe zone . The Sri Lankan army has relaunched its attacks on Tamil rebels in the country 's north . A rebel Web site , TamilNet , said government forces were engaged in a fresh ground offensive . A TamilNet correspondent in Vanni reported heavy shelling , rocket fire and gunfire . Thirty civilians died in shelling Sunday , rebels said . The government of Sri Lanka has been battling the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- rebels in a civil conflict that has lasted nearly 25 years . `` Thousands of civilians who had been forcibly held by the LTTE terrorists in the government declared No Fire Zone -LRB- NFZ -RRB- were rescued early hours this morning , 20 April , as the troops engaged in a massive scale rescue mission , were able to open a safe passage for the civilians , '' the Ministry of Defense Web site said . More than 10,000 civilians are trying to seek refuge with soldiers , the military said . The upsurge in hostilities follows a two-day cessation last week for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year . The U.S. State Department on Thursday called for a cease-fire between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers to allow civilians to escape the fighting . `` We call upon the government and military of Sri Lanka , and the Tamil Tigers , to immediately stop hostilities until the more than 140,000 civilians in the conflict area are safely out , '' acting spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement . `` Both sides must immediately return to a humanitarian pause and both must respect the right of free movement of those civilian men , women and children trapped by the fighting . '' Watch the heavy toll of fighting on civilians '' A brief cessation of hostilities announced by the Sri Lankan government on April 12 allowed the United Nations and its partners to bring in aid , but a renewed government offensive has left civilians trapped in a war zone . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his humanitarian chief John Holmes called the brief halt in fighting inadequate and have pushed for a longer humanitarian pause in fighting . The most pressing concern now , according to Holmes , is the fact that more than 100,000 people are crowded in a `` very small pocket of land '' that is about five square miles , or about twice the size of New York 's Central Park . `` It is a very small area indeed for what we believe is a very large number of people , '' Holmes told reporters Wednesday . Overcrowding is also a problem in camps housing displaced people , according to the United Nations Children 's Fund -LRB- UNICEF -RRB- . As of Monday , some 65,000 displaced people were crammed into camps in Vavuniya , Jaffna and Mannar , with 35,000 more expected to arrive within 48 hours , the organization said in a statement . ' UNICEF said it feared for children trapped in the escalating fighting and is worried that the worst is yet to come . The group appealed for donations to help cover `` the most immediate needs of the affected population in health and nutrition , water and sanitation , protection and education . '' The crowded population , primarily comprised of Tamil civilians , is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults . The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday , saying that the Tamil Tigers are using Tamil civilians as human shields . The Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries , including the United States and the European Union . As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict officially began in 1983 . The International Committee of the Red Cross said Monday that it has helped evacuate more than 10,000 sick and injured patients , and their caregivers , from Putumattalan in rebel-held territory since February . `` These evacuations have saved many lives , '' said Morven Murchinson , the Red Cross medical coordinator in Sri Lanka . `` It is vital that they continue , because more sick and wounded people are arriving every day at the makeshift medical facilities in Putumattalan . '' The Red Cross says there 's an acute shortage of medical supplies in the region , which it is trying to rectify .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda is still operating within Pakistan 's mountainous tribal region bordering Afghanistan , and the United States lacks a `` comprehensive '' plan for meeting its national security goals there , said a U.S. government study released Thursday . A Pakistani policeman watches over a border area in February 2008 . Despite the United States providing $ 10.5 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan , a key U.S. ally , the Government Accountability Office said it `` found broad agreement ... that al Qaeda had regenerated its ability to attack the United States and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven '' in Pakistan 's Federally Administrated Tribal Areas . Of the $ 10.5 billion in U.S. aid , more than half -- $ 5.8 billion -- was specifically provided for the tribal region , the GAO said . Furthermore , the report said , `` No comprehensive plan for meeting U.S. national security goals in FATA has been developed , as stipulated by the National Security Strategy for Combating Terrorism -LSB- in 2003 -RSB- , called for by an independent commission -LSB- in 2004 -RSB- and mandated by congressional legislation -LSB- in 2007 -RSB- . '' `` Our report does not state that the U.S. lacks agency-specific plans ; rather , we found that there was no comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of Defense , State , USAID -LSB- U.S. Agency for International Development -RSB- , the intelligence community , '' GAO said . After the September 11 terrorist attacks , U.S. officials said intelligence indicated that Osama bin Laden and other senior al Qaeda leaders , who had been based in Afghanistan before the attacks on New York and Washington , were operating in the tribal region . Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has denied that claim and has said that U.S. military missions there would violate Pakistan 's sovereignty . So , since 2002 , the United States has `` relied principally on the Pakistan military to address U.S. national security goals '' in that region , the GAO report said . Of the $ 5.8 billion the United States provided for aid in the tribal region , 96 percent of it reimbursed Pakistan for military operations there , the agency said . Two of the eight lawmakers who commissioned the GAO report , Democratic Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Menendez of New Jersey , said it indicated a failing on the part of the Bush administration . `` The Bush administration has had six years to come up with a plan to get Osama bin Laden and his group , but it is still flying by the seat of its pants , '' Menendez said in a statement . `` We 've dumped 10 billion American taxpayer dollars into Pakistan with the expectation that the terrorists will be hunted down and smoked out , but al Qaeda has been allowed to rejuvenate in the area that is supposed to be locked down , '' he said . Harkin called the report 's findings `` appalling . '' `` The White House must propose a strategic policy in this area and follow it , especially when we have this new opportunity to forge a fresh strategic relationship with the new civilian government in Pakistan , '' he said in a statement . The Defense Department said it agreed with the report 's findings , according to letters attached at the end of the GAO report , but the State Department disagreed with them , saying there was a comprehensive plan in place . A letter from Kathleen Turner , a spokeswoman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence , said that office and the National Counterterrorism Center concurred with the report 's assessment that the United States has not met its national security goals in the tribal region but maintained that there was a plan in place . USAID said that it generally agreed with the report 's recommendation for a comprehensive plan but that work in the tribal areas should be guided by the Pakistani government 's own FATA Sustainable Development Plan from 2006 .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's all tied up in Texas . Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running a tight race in Texas . A new CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll suggests the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois is a statistical dead heat in Texas , which holds primaries March 4 . In the survey , out Monday , 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters support Clinton as their choice for the party 's nominee , with 48 percent backing Obama . But taking into account the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 4 1\/2 percentage points for Democratic respondents , the race is a virtual tie . Watch Democrats target Texas . '' Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even . Map : National and state polling `` One reason the race appears to be tight is that Texas Democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options , '' says CNN polling director Keating Holland . `` Likely Democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination , and they do n't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues . `` Roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly , those people are splitting roughly equally between Clinton and Obama . '' Many political strategists and analysts consider Texas and Ohio -- which also holds a March 4 primary -- must-win states for Clinton . Obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in Texas . The new survey indicates Arizona Sen. John McCain is the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination . Among Republicans , 55 percent of likely Texas GOP primary voters support McCain as their choice for nominee . Thirty-two percent back former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former Libertarian standard-bearer Ron Paul . The poll 's sampling error for Republican respondents is 4 percentage points . The CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday . Pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in Texas , including 553 likely Republican primary voters and 529 likely Democratic primary voters . McCain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity . The poll was released on the same day the only living former Republican president -- George Herbert Walker Bush , the current president 's father -- endorsed McCain at an event in Houston . Watch McCain get a big boost '' But McCain has had trouble winning conservative voters . Just last week , McCain lost the conservative vote to Huckabee in the Virginia primary , according to exit polls . The new survey , though , suggests McCain may have better luck in Texas . `` It looks like McCain has made some inroads with conservative Republicans , '' Holland said . `` McCain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the GOP primary . The McCain campaign probably wishes that number were higher , but it does mean that a McCain victory in Texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents , as has happened in several states in the past few weeks . '' Texas Democrats and Republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues , but the poll suggests they do agree on what 's the most important issue . Thirty-five percent of Democrats and an equal number of Republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president . The second most important issue for Democrats was health care , at 23 percent , followed by the war in Iraq at 22 percent , illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent . Nineteen percent of Republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue , putting it in second place , followed by the war in Iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent . Sixty percent of Republicans say they 'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing . That number climbs to 76 percent for Democrats . Likely Democratic primary voters view Clinton and Obama on roughly equal terms . Seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if Clinton were the nominee ; an equal number feel the same way about Obama . Seventy-nine percent say it 's likely Clinton can win the nomination ; 82 percent say the same about Obama . The two candidates are essentially tied on immigration , Iraq and the economy , but Clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion . E-mail to a friend","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has included three uncapped players in his final 23-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa . Winger Pedro Rodriguez , 22 , was named along with his Barcelona teammate Victor Valdes , who edged out 19-year-old David De Gea and Villarreal 's Diego Lopez for the third goalkeeping place . De Gea 's 21-year-old clubmate Javi Martinez was handed a midfield berth , having impressed as Atletico Madrid won the UEFA Europa League this season and reached the final of the Spanish Cup . `` They have had a good season , they are coming to strengthen the squad as substitutes for other players , '' Del Bosque told reporters . Martinez 's fellow under-21 international , Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta , missed out along with midfielders Santi Cazorla and Marcos Senna , who both featured when Spain won Euro 2008 . Sevilla striker Alvaro Negredo was also chopped , as was another member of the triumphant 2008 squad , Dani Guiza . Del Bosque is giving England-based stars Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit , retaining the duo as they recover from injuries . Midfielder Andres Iniesta is also expected to be ready , having returned from a calf problem in the last game of the Spanish league season as Barcelona claimed the title . Barcelona 's 19-year-old Bojan Krkic , who missed Spain 's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue , did not even make the initial 30-man squad named earlier this month . England coach Fabio Capello was forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup . The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form , but brought Liverpool 's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up . Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello , who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury . Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads . Blog : Will `` the Force '' be with Capello at World Cup ? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004 , but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity . `` He said no , he preferred to stay with the family . But I tried , '' Capello told the UK Press Association . Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury , while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa . Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem , with Tottenham 's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland 's 25-goal Darren Bent . Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence , as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City , who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad . Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod , having last played for England in 2008 , after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea 's first team . Germany captain Michael Ballack was ruled out of the World Cup after suffering an ankle injury in the English FA Cup final . The Chelsea midfielder was caught by a bad tackle from Portsmouth 's Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng , who has decided to switch nationalities to play for Group D opponents Ghana and whose half-brother Jerome was earlier named in the preliminary 27-man German squad . With No. 1 goalkeeper Rene Adler also sidelined by injury , the 35-year-old Hans-Jorg Butt received his first call-up since 20003 to vie for a starting place with Schalke 's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen 's Tim Wiese . Butt 's young Bayern Munich clubmates Holger Badstuber , 21 , and Thomas Muller , 20 , gave the Bundesliga champions seven players in coach Joachim Low 's squad . Italy 's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad , resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement . Totti 's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero , with Villarreal 's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named . Inter Milan 's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella -LRB- Napoli -RRB- , Vincenzo Iaquinta -LRB- Juventus -RRB- , Antonio Di Natale -LRB- Udinese -RRB- , Marco Borriello -LRB- Milan -RRB- , Alberto Gilardino -LRB- Fiorentina -RRB- and Giampaolo Pazzini -LRB- Sampdoria -RRB- were picked . Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad . France coach Raymond Domenech has trimmed his initial 30-man selection down to 24 , with Marseille striker Hatem Ben Arfa and Lille goalkeeper Mickael Landreau dropped along with defenders Adil Rami and Rod Fanni , midfielder Yann Mvila and forward Jimmy Briand . Defender Williams Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness , having been sidelined since March with a leg injury . His Arsenal clubmate Samir Nasri missed out on the initial squad , but Gael Clichy , Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna were included . Young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema also failed to pass the first selection obstacle , while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira meant Thierry Henry was the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad . Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk 's 30-man , potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old 's international career . Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury , but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected . `` I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup , '' Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld . `` I believe that Ruud is fit , but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level . '' Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad , which features 14 overseas-based names . Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst , 35 , has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament . Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe , who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December . Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga 's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers , but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists , who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel , Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems . Liverpool 's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot , while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem . Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City , who as loaned to Bolton this season . Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad , with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United . Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad . Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month . Olsen , who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup , gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008 . Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo 's struggles with injuries this season . The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin , Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos . Switzerland defender Christoph Spycher has pulled out of coach Ottmar Hitzfeld 's experienced 23-man squad for the finals after failing to overcome a knee injury . The 32-year-old , who had already decided to retire from internationals after the tournament , has been replaced by Ludovic Magnin -- one of seven reserve players named by the German . Hitzfeld has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente , fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin , who are all 30 and above . Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal , while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included .","question":""}

{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An illegal immigrant dishwasher who lost $ 49,000 to the U.S. government as he tried to take it home to Guatemala will get some of the money back , his attorney said Wednesday . Pedro Zapeta , an illegal immigrant , managed to save $ 59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years . Pedro Zapeta was `` very , very happy '' when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money , said attorney Robert Gershman , who handled the financial end of Zapeta 's case . Zapeta was carrying $ 59,000 in cash when he was stopped at a security checkpoint at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in 2005 . He told authorities he was returning home to Guatemala with the money he had saved working illegally as a dishwasher over 11 years . But federal law requires that anyone leaving or entering the country with $ 10,000 or more must declare it . Because Zapeta had not done so , he was detained , and his money was seized . The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the judge who fined Zapeta applied an incorrect standard in determining the amount to be forfeited . The appeals court ordered a hearing to set a new fine . `` I am extremely happy , '' Gershman said . `` Even though he is not a citizen , it shows he has equal rights . '' Gershman has said Zapeta , who does not speak English , was not trying to conceal the money but did not know the law . Zapeta had paid taxes on the earnings , he said , and under legal guidelines should be fined at most $ 5,000 for failing to report that he was traveling with the cash . Circuit Court Judge James Cohn instead fined Zapeta $ 49,000 , all the money he was carrying over the $ 10,000 limit . `` The government always acted as if the money was their own , '' Gershman said . `` They acted almost entitled to it . But it 's not their money . It was Pedro 's , and the -LSB- appeals -RSB- court affirmed that . '' Zapeta said last year that he had saved the money to build a house for himself and his family in his home village in the Guatemalan mountains . He returned to Guatemala this year under the threat of deportation , but his lawyers continued to argue that his fine was excessive . Federal prosecutors in Miami did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision or on whether they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court . As Zapeta 's case was publicized , U.S. residents donated money to him , and Gershman set up a trust . It has received about $ 15,000 in donations , he said .","question":""}

Christie said his father forced him to help cover the body with tires , douse it in gasoline and set it on fire , Humboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp said in a statement Thursday . Christie 's dad had held and abused Turpin at his house for several weeks before killing her , Christie told the sheriff 's office . She had been reported missing to Humboldt County law enforcement on April 8 , 1988 .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attorney General Eric Holder stepped up his call for the passage of federal hate crimes legislation Thursday , arguing that the federal government needs to take a stronger stand against criminal activity fueled by bias and bigotry . Attorney General Eric Holder has been a vocal proponent for tougher laws regarding hate crimes . He also sought to assure opponents that such a bill would not allow Christian clergy to be prosecuted for outspoken opposition to homosexuality . Holder made his remarks during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is currently considering the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act . The bill would allow the Justice Department to provide assistance to state and local authorities in the prosecution of hate crimes while also expanding federal protection against hate crimes to cover disability , gender and sexual orientation . `` Hate crimes victimize not only individuals but entire communities , '' Holder said . `` Perpetrators of hate crimes seek to deny the humanity that we all share , regardless of the color of our skin , the God to whom we pray or the person who we choose to love . ... , '' he said . `` The time is now to provide justice to victims of bias-motivated violence and to redouble our efforts to protect our communities from violence based on bigotry and prejudice . '' The attorney general argued that recent numbers `` suggest that hate crimes against certain groups are on the rise , such as individuals of Hispanic national origin . '' Specifically , he said , more than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007 , or `` nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade . '' In light of such statistics , he said , it was one of his `` highest personal priorities ... is to do everything I can to ensure this critical legislation finally becomes law . '' Republicans on the Judiciary Committee disputed Holder 's assertion that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of hate crimes . They also questioned the need for federal involvement in the prosecution of violent acts -- traditionally a function of state and local governments . They pointed to FBI figures showing a slight decline from 7,755 hate crimes reported in 1998 to 7,624 in 2007 , the most recently compiled statistics . It is `` important to know -LRB- if -RRB- we have a problem of significant numbers of -LRB- hate crime -RRB- cases ... not being prosecuted in state and local governments , '' said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , the ranking Republican on the committee . `` Murders occur all over America every day . Robberies , assaults , rapes , burglaries occur every day , and those are handled by our state and local jurisdictions . ... They do a pretty good job . '' When pressed , Holder acknowledged he had no hard evidence of trends showing the problem getting worse , nor that states are not prosecuting cases based on their own state hate crimes statutes . The attorney general insisted , however , that the issue should be viewed more broadly . `` It seems to me this is a question of conscience , '' Holder argued . He emphasized that the bill is designed to give special protections to groups that historically have been victims solely based on who they are . Holder added that while state and local governments generally do a good job prosecuting violent crimes , there is nevertheless a need for the federal government to serve as a `` backstop '' on occasion , particularly if localities lack the resources for an effective investigation or prosecution . `` There are instances where the -LRB- federal -RRB- government needs to come in , '' he said . He also asserted that any federal hate crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs . `` It is the person who commits the actual act of violence , who would be subject to this legislation , not the person who is simply expressing an opinion , '' Holder said . Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality . The attorney general has been a vocal proponent of federal hate crimes legislation since his tenure in the Clinton Justice Department . Last week , in a speech on civil rights , he cited three recent fatal shootings in calling for stricter hate crimes laws . `` The violence in Washington , Little Rock and Wichita reminds us of the potential threat posed by violent extremists and the tragedy that ensues when reasoned discourse is replaced by armed confrontation , '' he said . Holder was referring to the shooting death of a security guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , allegedly by a self-avowed white supremacist ; the shooting of two U.S. soldiers in Little Rock , Arkansas , allegedly by a man prosecutors say was targeting the U.S. military for its treatment of Muslims ; and the slaying of a doctor who ran a women 's clinic in Wichita , Kansas , allegedly by an abortion opponent .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Financial crisis-stricken Iceland formally applied for European Union membership on Friday , a day after lawmakers narrowly backed a government plan to take the island nation into the economic and political bloc . Icelandic PM Johanna Sigurdardottir pledged to take Iceland into the EU during April 's election campaign . A copy of the application was submitted to the Swedish government , which currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency , Iceland 's Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement . Iceland 's economy was devastated by the collapse of the island 's banking system last year , leading to the resignation of the country 's government . In elections in April , center left leader Johanna Sigurdardottir was elected prime minister after pledging to take Iceland into the EU . On Thursday , Iceland 's parliament , the Althing , voted in favor of the government plan by 33 votes to 28 with two abstentions . `` This is a historic day for Iceland , '' Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said in a statement . `` As a European nation already deeply integrated into European structures ... we now look forward to taking the next logical step , in close cooperation with our European partners . '' Welcoming Iceland 's application , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said : `` The decision of the Icelandic Parliament is a sign of the vitality of the European project and indicative of the hope that the European Union represents . Iceland is a European country with long and deep democratic roots . '' Iceland already benefits from a free trade arrangement with European Union member states , latterly as a participating member of the European Economic Area , which was established in 1994 , and formerly through a bilateral free trade agreement with the EEC , the EU 's predecessor . But Icelanders have traditionally been skeptical of the benefits of full EU membership , fearing that they would lose some of their independence as a small state within a larger political entity . At present three other states in southeastern Europe -- Croatia , FYR Macedonia and Turkey -- are candidate countries for EU membership . `` I am pleased that the EU 's enlargement agenda may soon extend to Europe 's north-western corner as well , with Iceland , a country with deep democratic traditions , in addition to our continued commitment to South East Europe , '' said Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Perhaps it really WAS destiny . `` Slumdog Millionaire , '' the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an American release , won eight Oscars Sunday night at the 81st annual Academy Awards , including best picture . `` Most of all we had passion and we had belief , and our film shows if you have those two things , you have everything , '' said producer Christian Colson , surrounded by many members of the film 's huge cast and crew . It was a supremely unlikely success story . `` Millionaire , '' which combines elements of Bollywood melodrama and documentary grit , features no stars . It 's set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai , India , and one-third of the film is in Hindi . Its initially reluctant director , Danny Boyle , is better known for brash British films such as `` Trainspotting '' and `` 28 Days Later . '' And the film almost went straight to DVD in America , thanks to the folding of initial studio Warner Independent Pictures -LRB- like CNN , it 's a unit of Time Warner -RRB- . But the film 's orphaned , poverty-raised hero , played by Dev Patel , overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show `` Who Wants to Be a Millionaire '' -- not necessarily to win money , but to connect with his lost love . On the show , he 's told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny . `` It is written , '' the show 's smarmy host tells him , somewhat mockingly , after Patel 's character aces several questions . List of winners , nominees `` Slumdog 's '' filmmakers were jubilant at the wins , which also included Oscars for best director -LRB- Boyle -RRB- , best adapted screenplay -LRB- Simon Beaufoy -RRB- , score -LRB- A.R. Rahman -RRB- , cinematography -LRB- Anthony Dod Mantle -RRB- , song , sound mixing and film editing . Boyle jumped up and down as he accepted his award , saying he 'd told his children that if he ever won , he 'd bounce like Tigger from `` Winnie-the-Pooh . '' Rahman was equally appreciative . `` All my life I 've had a choice between hate and love , and I chose love , and now I 'm here , '' he said . Gallery : See what the stars are wearing '' `` Slumdog 's '' main competition , `` The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , '' won just three Oscars , all in minor categories . The film had led the pack with 13 nominations . The rest of the Oscar broadcast alternated between host Hugh Jackman 's smooth song-and-dance numbers , some comic moments from Steve Martin , Tina Fey and Ben Stiller , and politics , generally focused on gay rights and California 's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 . Sean Penn won best actor for playing Harvey Milk in `` Milk , '' the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office . Penn earned laughs and applause for his speech . iReport.com : What do you think of the winners ? `` You commie homo-loving sons of guns , '' the sometimes truculent actor began , to laughter . `` I did not expect this , and I wanted to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me , often . But I am touched by the appreciation . '' After a series of thank-you 's , he turned serious in talking about gay marriage . `` For those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight , I think it 's a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren 's eyes if they continue that support , '' Penn said . `` We 've got to have equal rights for everyone . '' Dustin Lance Black , who won original screenplay for `` Milk , '' also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights . `` I think -LSB- Milk -RSB- would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful , wonderful creatures of value , and that no matter what anyone tells you , God does love you and that very soon , I promise you , you will have equal rights , federally , across this great nation of ours .

Ledger is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor . Peter Finch won best actor for 1976 's `` Network '' two months after he died in early 1977 . Other winners included Kate Winslet , who won best actress for her performance in `` The Reader '' ; Penelope Cruz , who won best supporting actress honor for `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' ; and `` WALL-E , '' which won best animated feature . Most of the winners , if not foreordained , were expected . The evening 's sole shock came with best foreign-language film , which went to the Japanese film `` Departures . '' Among the films it beat were France 's `` The Class '' and Israel 's `` Dances With Bashir , '' two of the best-reviewed films of the year . The Oscars moved at a steady pace , largely thanks to Jackman 's brisk , jokey work . Only the introductions to the four acting categories , in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on `` This Is Your Life , '' considerably slowed the show , which ran close to three and a half hours . At various points , Jackman cracked wise about downsizing -- `` Next year , '' said the `` Australia '' star , `` I 'll be starring in a movie called ` New Zealand ' '' -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles , and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out VIPs in a nightclub . He even physically carried Anne Hathaway on stage to play Richard Nixon in a `` Frost\/Nixon '' send-up . Blog : Behind the scenes But it was `` Slumdog Millionaire '' that carried the evening . At one point , Resul Pookutty , who won for sound mixing , seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his Oscar . `` I dedicate this award to my country , '' he said . `` Thank you , Academy , this is not just a sound award , this is history being handed over to me .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration has decided to rescind invitations to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth celebrations overseas because of violent crackdowns against protesters in Iran , the White House said Wednesday . President Obama on Tuesday toughened his stance on Iran 's crackdown on protesters . `` July Fourth allows us to celebrate the freedom and the liberty we enjoy : freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom to assemble peacefully , freedom of the press , '' White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . `` Given the events of the past many days , those invitations will no longer be extended . '' The administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of the president 's policy of engaging the Iranian regime . In late May the State Department sent a cable to its embassies and consulates worldwide informing them they `` may invite representatives from the government of Iran '' to their July Fourth celebrations . But in a fresh cable sent to all embassies and consulates Wednesday evening , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered posts `` to rescind all invitations that have been extended to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth events . `` Unfortunately the circumstances have changed and participation by Iranian diplomats would not be appropriate in light of the Iranian government 's continued violent and unjust actions against its own people , '' said the cable , obtained by CNN . `` For invitations which have been extended , posts should make clear that Iranian participation is no longer appropriate in the current circumstances . For invitations which have not been extended , no further action is needed . '' A senior administration official said Clinton made the decision , and then informed President Obama . The U.S. receptions marking Independence Day usually feature symbols of Americana , such as hot dogs , red-white-and-blue decorations and remarks by U.S. officials about America 's founding fathers . One senior administration official said Wednesday the reconsideration of the July Fourth invitations is consistent with Obama 's comments Tuesday , in which he said he was `` shocked and appalled '' at the violence against demonstrators . `` The president said yesterday how this plays out will affect what we do , '' the official said . Obama said Tuesday , `` If Iran chooses a path that abides by international norms and principles , then we are interested in healing some of the wounds of 30 years in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations . '' Watch Obama ramp up criticism of Iran '' On Tuesday , Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Florida , the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said an invitation to Iranian diplomats would send the wrong message to Iranians `` who are bravely standing up for the same rights and freedoms which Americans celebrate on this day . '' `` The Fourth of July is a day when we celebrate democracy and reflect on the gift of freedom which all Americans cherish , '' she said in a statement . `` The Iranian people are no less worthy of freedom and self-governance than citizens of the United States . '' Earlier this year , as part of the policy to engage Iran , Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government . In March , Richard Holbrooke , the Obama administration 's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , spoke briefly with Iran 's deputy foreign minister , Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh , at an Afghanistan conference in The Hague . Administration officials believe the U.S. will engage Iran at some point to address issues of U.S. national security , including the nuclear issue , but the idea of bilateral engagement is in a holding pattern while the violence continues . `` I would n't say engagement is off the table , but it is certainly on ice , '' a senior administration official said this week .","question":""}
{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes , Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943 . Putin , right , is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran . Putin , who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations , said that he and the other leaders agreed that `` peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed '' in the region . `` The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives , '' he said . Russia is building Iran 's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran . On Monday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration 's stance that `` all options '' must be kept `` on the table '' in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary . `` We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program , their willingness to live up to their rhetoric , their intentions for Iraq , or their ambitions in the Gulf region , '' Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs . The leaders of Iran , Russia , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world 's largest inland body of water . Speaking afterwards , Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran , The Associated Press reported . `` We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state , '' Putin said . `` The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states , therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here , '' added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Putin , defying reports of an assassination plot against him , was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran 's Mehrabad Airport . During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden , Germany , Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans . `` Of course I will travel to Iran , '' Putin said . `` If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time , I could never leave the house . '' Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin , with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless . `` Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and can not damage the trend of the prepared programs , '' spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency . Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media , particularly the U.S. media , saying the report was `` made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war . '' Putin 's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin 's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . `` Putin 's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia 's independence in global affairs . Putin , who approaches the end of his term , wants to demonstrate that he would n't cave in to the U.S. pressure , '' said Alexander Pikayev , an expert on Iran with Russia 's Institute for World Economy and International Relations , in a report carried by AP .

{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday discussed a `` general time horizon '' for any American troop withdrawals from Iraq , al-Maliki 's office said . Sen. Barack Obama rides in a helicopter Monday with Gen. David Petraeus in Baghdad , Iraq . Obama -- who has made ending the Iraq war a cornerstone of his run for office -- engaged in what were described as productive talks with al-Maliki during a trip to Iraq . The Iraqi government has been pushing for the United States to set a general timetable to spell out troop withdrawals . Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi also met with Obama Monday and told reporters afterward they discussed the security agreement . `` I told Sen. Obama -LRB- that -RRB- Iraqi and American negotiations regarding this are ongoing , and today new Iraqi-American negotiations on this agreement have started with Iraqi written proposals and have a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , '' he said . The Bush administration has opposed timetables for troop withdrawals . But al-Maliki and President Bush last week agreed to a `` general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals '' on troop cuts . The prime minister reiterated that principle with Obama , according to a statement from al-Maliki 's office . `` Developments of the situation and the circumstances is what will decide the presence of foreign troops in Iraq , but without keeping open-ended dates , '' al-Maliki said , according to a statement from his office . `` With the developments on the ground , we can set a vision and clear horizons regarding this issue , and this is a view both sides agree on in the ongoing negotiations . '' Al-Maliki 's office quoted Obama as saying he is `` supportive and committed to preserving the gains achieved by the Iraqi government '' under al-Maliki 's leadership and that he admires the prime minister 's courage . Obama has proposed withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office . Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government 's `` vision '' is that most U.S. combat troops would be out of Iraq by 2010 . Asked if that stance is part of the current negotiations , al-Dabbagh said , `` No . This is the Iraqi vision . '' iReport.com : Tell us the most important thing the next president needs to know about Iraq A German magazine on Saturday quoted al-Maliki as saying he backed Obama 's proposal , but al-Dabbagh has said that his remarks `` were misunderstood , mistranslated and not conveyed accurately . '' In a statement Sunday , the magazine , Der Spiegel , said it `` stands by its version of this interview . '' In the magazine interview , al-Maliki did not indicate that he was endorsing Obama over Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee . McCain does not think American troops should return to the United States until Iraqi forces are capable of maintaining a safe , democratic state . He has been a strong advocate of the `` surge '' -- the 2007 escalation of U.S. troops -- and has said troops should stay in Iraq as long as needed . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -- who 's been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for McCain -- on Monday criticized Obama 's push to remove troops in 16 months as an `` arbitrary timetable based on politics versus a plan based on the actual results on the ground . '' `` One of the reasons I 'm supporting -LSB- McCain -RSB- -- he has made it clear he would rather lose an election than lose a war . He 's made it very clear -- let 's listen to the commanders on the ground , '' Jindal said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' McCain last week chided Obama for laying out his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan before talking to Gen. David Petraeus , the head of U.S. troops in Iraq . Obama met with Petraeus and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , in Baghdad on Monday . He also met with Tariq al-Hashimi , a Sunni Arab who is one of Iraq 's two vice presidents ; Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin , commander of Multi-National Corps-Iraq ; British Maj. Gen. Barney White Spunner , commander of Multi-National Division South East ; and Maj. General Abdul Aziz , the Iraqi army 's 14th Division commander . Obama 's stop in Iraq marks his second visit to the country . The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee 's trip abroad began in Kuwait and Afghanistan and will go on to Jordan , Israel , the West Bank , Germany , France and Britain . The senator from Illinois first visited Iraq in 2006 . See the stops on Obama 's trip '' Obama arrived Monday afternoon in the southern city of Basra , according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Armand Cucciniello . Obama is traveling with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island , a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee , and Sen. Chuck Hagel , a Nebraska Republican who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and is an outspoken critic of the Iraq war . Obama has said that if he 's elected , he would commit more troops to Afghanistan and would order the military to end the war in Iraq , which he has called a `` dangerous distraction '' from the Afghan battle .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A group of native Hawaiians occupied the grounds of the old Hawaiian monarchy 's royal residence Wednesday , vowing to stay and do the business of the kingdom 's government . A member of the protest group Hawaiian Kingdom Government unlocks the palace gate . `` It is through a greater realm than ours '' that the group took this action , said Mahealani Kahau , elected leader of the group , called Hawaiian Kingdom Government . `` Today and every day , we will be here to assume our role . '' Group members left the palace grounds Wednesday afternoon , but vowed to return Thursday morning , The Honolulu Advertiser reported . `` We 'll be here at 6 o'clock in the morning , '' Kahau told the newspaper . The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii -- overthrew the kingdom 's government . The monarchist groups say that the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally . Hawaii 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday 's action . The staff of Iolani Palace , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors . The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action . The group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed . `` It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , '' said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio , who added that although she , too , is a native Hawaiian , she does not understand the actions of the group . Ascencio also said that the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security . Jose Carrion , a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico , told Honolulu 's KHON-TV that he was `` disappointed '' he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and `` learn about the culture of the Hawaiians . '' `` We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy , '' said Carrion , who said he had reservations for the visit . `` But we 're leaving tomorrow so we wo n't get to see the palace . '' But Carrion also said he `` kind of understood '' the actions of the group .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man suspected of fatally shooting an Iowa football coach Wednesday was released from a hospital the day before , without the knowledge of police , who had asked to be notified , authorities said . Ed Thomas had been with the school district for more than 30 years and was well-known in the region . Mark Becker , 24 , faces first-degree murder charges in the death of Ed Thomas , 58 , a longtime football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School . Investigators believe Becker walked into the school 's weight room , where Thomas was overseeing athletes ' weight lifting , about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday and shot him multiple times as about 20 horrified students looked on . Thomas was flown to a hospital , where he later died . `` It 's just too early to speculate '' on a motive for the shooting , said Kevin Winker , assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation . Authorities said Becker was a former student at Aplington-Parkersburg , which is about 100 miles northeast of Des Moines , Iowa , and a former football player . The agency , however , noted that Becker had `` recent contact '' with police in Cedar Falls , Iowa , about 25 miles to the east of Parkersburg . On June 20 , Becker led police on a high-speed chase after he allegedly broke into a man 's house , according to a division statement . He was taken into custody , but early the next morning authorities determined he needed medical attention and he was taken to a hospital . Police asked to be notified when he was released , the statement said . But on Tuesday , Becker was released and spent the night at his parents ' Parkersburg home before heading to the high school Wednesday morning , the division said . `` Law enforcement was unaware that Becker had been released . '' Cedar Falls police earlier said in a statement that they responded June 20 to a report of a man breaking several windows in a Cedar Falls home with a baseball bat and driving his car through a garage door . Just before officers arrived , the man fled the scene in his car and was seen leaving the area . Becker was arrested after a pursuit that reached speeds of more than 80 mph , Cedar Falls police said . He was taken into custody by Butler County authorities and later taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation , according to the statement . `` Cedar Falls police was awaiting notification that the subject was to be released from custody in order to arrest Becker and file the charges relevant to the Cedar Falls incident , '' according to the police statement . He faces felony charges of criminal mischief and eluding authorities , along with traffic offenses , in the Saturday incident , Cedar Falls police said . Winker would not provide further details about why Becker was transported to the hospital . A 911 call was received at 7:47 a.m. Wednesday regarding the high school shooting , the Division of Criminal Investigation said . Becker was located in the driveway of his parents ' home , where he was arrested without incident . Coincidentally , Becker had been released from the same hospital where his alleged victim died -- Covenant Hospital in Waterloo , Iowa . Thomas had been with the school district since 1975 and was a regionally well-known coach , according to district Superintendent Jon Thompson . The coach 's son , Aaron Thomas , spoke briefly to reporters Wednesday , saying that his father would want to be remembered not only as a coach , teacher and father , but also for his involvement in his church , calling him `` a man of deep faith who touched many lives . '' `` God always has a reason , '' he said . `` At this time , it 's very tough for us to understand that . '' He thanked the community for an outpouring of support , recalling residents ' struggle to rebuild after a deadly tornado struck the Parkersburg area last year . But he also reminded residents to have concern and compassion for Becker 's family . `` We ask that people pray for them as well , and that people take time to comfort and be with them , '' he said . `` I know that my father 's legacy ... will live on , '' Aaron Thomas said . `` Without a doubt , we 're going to miss him . We will have many great memories to share and to think back upon . We were lucky to have the father we had ... I feel very fortunate to be the son of Ed Thomas . '' No students were injured or threatened in Wednesday 's incident , authorities said . The school was placed on lockdown immediately . Crisis counselors were on the scene to assist students who witnessed the shooting , Thompson said . A vigil was planned in Thomas ' honor Wednesday night .

'' The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii -- overthrew the kingdom 's government . The monarchist groups say the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally . Hawaii 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday 's action . The staff of Iolani Palace , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors . The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action . The group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed . `` It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , '' said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio , who added that although she is a native Hawaiian , she does not understand the actions of the group . Ascencio also said the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security . Jose Carrion , a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico , told Honolulu 's KHON-TV that he was disappointed he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and `` learn about the culture of the Hawaiians . '' `` We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy , '' said Carrion , who said he had reservations for the visit . `` But we 're leaving tomorrow , so we wo n't get to see the palace .

{"answer":"Santiago , Chile -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three strong earthquakes rocked Chile on Thursday , causing significant damage in at least one city , the country 's newly inaugurated president said Thursday . A 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit at 11:39 a.m. local time -LRB- 9:39 a.m. ET -RRB- , followed by a 6.7-magnitude quake 16 minutes later , the U.S. Geological Survey reported . A third , measured at magnitude 6.0 , came 27 minutes later . They were the strongest aftershocks to rattle Chile since a February 27 earthquake on the country 's west coast that toppled buildings and spawned a tsunami , killing several hundred people . Thursday 's quakes shook the ground near Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins near the coast just as Chile prepared to inaugurate a new president , Sebastian Pinera . The central Chilean city of Rancagua was affected , Pinera said . `` There is significant damage in Rancagua , '' the new president said . `` We 're going to send the necessary armed forces to guarantee citizens ' safety . '' Rancagua Mayor Eduardo Soto said that no fatalities were immediately reported and that the biggest worry was damage to homes , CNN Chile reported . After his inauguration Thursday , Pinera visited Rancagua , where he confirmed there were no initial reports of fatalities . He said that no curfew would be imposed for now and reiterated his call for calm . A priority is for the school year to start as scheduled next week , he said . He also said Thursday afternoon that he would declare the area a catastrophe zone . The country 's national emergency authorities also put in place a tsunami alert for the coastal area near where the earthquakes hit , and authorities ordered evacuations of some coastal areas . `` I do n't want to alarm anyone , -LSB- the alert -RSB- is solely precautionary , but we have to take precautions when there are human lives at risk , '' Pinera said . The epicenter of Thursday 's first quake was about 95 miles -LRB- 152 km -RRB- south-southwest of the capital , Santiago , and about 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- away from Valparaiso , where Pinera was to be inaugurated . Television footage showed the inauguration proceeding without a hitch . A second earthquake -- with an initial magnitude of 6.9 -- struck moments later . It was about 89 miles -LRB- 143 km -RRB- southwest of Santiago , the USGS said . The third was about 86 miles -LRB- 138 km -RRB- southwest of Santiago . Rolando Santos , senior vice president and general manager of CNN Chile , said he and his colleagues felt one of the quakes . `` I can tell you within our newsroom in Santiago , which is state of the art in terms of seismic construction , it shook for more than 45 seconds , '' he said . He said that he told staffers to get under desks and that three people burst into tears . In the last two days , people had kind of gotten used to aftershocks , but `` there was no question this one got everyone 's attention , '' he said . Are you there ? Send pictures Pinera , a conservative billionaire businessman , became the Chilean president about 12:15 p.m. local time , roughly 20 minutes after the second quake . The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a statement that `` a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected '' as a result of the quakes , and that there is no tsunami threat to Hawaii . However , the center also said that `` earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within '' about 62 miles -LRB- 100 km -RRB- of the epicenter . Hundreds of people were killed when the magnitude-8 .8 earthquake struck Chile 's west coast February 27 . That quake also triggered a tsunami that toppled buildings , especially in the coastal Maule region . How to help : Impact Your World Authorities this week released the names of 279 people whose bodies had been identified in the quake , but officials said the new tally does not include hundreds of unidentified victims . The February 27 earthquake was violent enough to move the Chilean city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west and Santiago about 11 inches to the west-southwest , researchers said .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. schoolchildren still have work to do when it comes to mathematics , the secretary of education said Wednesday . Education Secretary Arne Duncan says U.S. schools need to be better equipped to teach math . Arne Duncan , releasing a report on the Department of Education 's latest examination of how well American children are doing in mathematics , said no one should be satisfied with what it found . `` Today 's results are evidence that we must better equip our schools to improve the knowledge and skills of America 's students in mathematics , '' he said . `` More must be done to narrow the troubling achievement gap that has persisted in mathematics , and to ensure that America 's students make greater gains toward becoming competitive with their peers in other countries . '' Fourth - and eighth-grade students from more than 7,000 public and private schools nationwide were tested by the National Assessment of Educational Progress for the report , titled `` The Nation 's Report Card : Mathematics 2009 . '' Massachusetts students had the highest marks at both grade levels . Other high-performing states were Minnesota , Vermont , New Hampshire and New Jersey . The area with the lowest marks in both grades was the District of Columbia , though the report showed that the district -- along with Nevada , New Hampshire , Rhode Island and Vermont -- had improved its scores since the last tests were taken in 2007 . The average scores were categorized at each grade level into four groups : below basic , basic , proficient , and advanced . According to the Department of Education , some of the skills required to achieve a basic level of understanding of mathematics at the fourth-grade level include performing simple computations with whole numbers ; showing understanding of fractions and decimals ; and solving simple real-world problems . To achieve a basic level of understanding at the eighth-grade level , students must be able work with whole numbers , decimals , fractions and percentages ; be able to solve word problems and use diagrams , charts and graphs ; and be able to solve simple algebra and geometry problems . Scores were slightly higher in the 2009 report than they were in 2007 , but Duncan said more needs to be done . `` Our students need to graduate high school ready to succeed in college and the workplace , '' he said . The National Assessment of Educational Progress results `` are a call to action to reform the teaching and learning of mathematics and other related subjects in order to prepare our students to compete in the global economy .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Republican congressman Wednesday asked the head of the FBI to investigate allegations that the CIA lied to Congress about the Bush administration 's use of `` alternative '' interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists . Rep. Darrell Issa asked the FBI to investigate Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's claim that the CIA lied to Congress . Rep. Darrell Issa , a member of the House Judiciary Committee , asked FBI director Robert Mueller whether the bureau was investigating that allegation and whether he could request a probe as a member of Congress . He said the claim , leveled last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , left him doubting whether `` I can believe in the briefings I am receiving '' from intelligence agencies . `` If CIA is lying to any of us -- and I have been briefed many times by them on the Intelligence Committee -- it puts me in a position of not being able to do my job properly , '' said Issa , R-California . Pelosi made the charge in response to questions about what she was told about the use of the techniques , which critics say amounted to the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody . Her claim provoked a firestorm on Capitol Hill , with Republicans -- who generally defend the techniques -- blasting Pelosi and demanding she back up the allegation . Mueller said he would check into whether Issa 's request would be enough to launch an investigation . Watch more on the Pelosi-CIA controversy '' Justice Department documents released in April show Bush administration lawyers authorized the use of techniques such as sleep deprivation , slapping , stress positions and waterboarding , which produces the sensation of drowning . Waterboarding in particular has been considered a form of torture since the Spanish Inquisition , and U.S. authorities prosecuted Japanese officers who used the techniques against American prisoners during World War II . But Bush administration lawyers argued that the tactics did not violate U.S. laws against torture as long as interrogators had no intent to cause `` severe pain . '' Many Republicans , including former Vice President Dick Cheney , argue the tactics produced useful intelligence that saved American lives . Pelosi , D-California , has called for an investigation into whether the Bush administration authorized the torture of suspected al Qaeda figures , prompting Republicans to question what she knew about the tactics at the time they were approved . Watch Colin Powell 's former aide speak out on CIA 's history '' She told reporters last week that she was briefed by the CIA on such techniques once -- in September 2002 , when she was the ranking Democrat on the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee -- and that she was told at the time that techniques such as waterboarding were not being used . She said she learned that waterboarding had been used after other lawmakers were briefed in 2003 . CIA spokesman George Little said last week that the agency 's records indicate Pelosi was briefed on the interrogation methods being used . But Little said it was up to lawmakers `` to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened . '' Rep. Pete Hoekstra , the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said Monday that Pelosi may be forced to resign if her claims are proven untrue . `` Either the CIA needs to be held accountable for their performance during this time , or the speaker needs to be held accountable and be responsible for the actions and the statements that she made last week , '' Hoekstra said . But Rep. Baron Hill , D-Indiana , said Republicans are trying to divert attention from the question of torture by attacking Pelosi . `` I think a lot of people have lost focus on the people who put those torture policies in place in the first place , '' Hill said . `` Nancy did n't do anything wrong , in terms of the legalities , that I 'm aware of . I do n't know what she was told . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The identity and nationality of an alleged al Qaeda operative arrested in Pakistan remained shrouded in mystery and conflicting information Monday , a day after Pakistani officials said one of the FBI 's most wanted terrorists was in custody . A Pakistani military official said Monday that the man arrested is a foreign operative linked to al Qaeda . The official did not specifically describe the man as American and gave no further details . On Sunday , a senior Pakistani government official said that Adam Gadahn , a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda , had been arrested . A second senior Pakistani government official later confirmed Gadahn 's arrest . But a U.S. intelligence official said there appeared to be no validity to the reports that Gadahn was in custody . Other U.S. officials also said they had no indication Gadahn had been captured . U.S. counterterrorism officials said Monday they had received no indication from Pakistan that any American had been arrested . One official said there was `` no validity '' to reports that Gadahn was arrested . Another called the reports `` bogus . '' News reports Monday cited Pakistani officials as saying that a different man , believed to be an American member of al Qaeda , had been arrested . But U.S. counterterrorism officials said the United States has not heard of the person , who was identified in some reports as Abu Yahya Mujahdeen al-Adam , an American born in Pennsylvania . One official said the reports coming out of Pakistan were a `` real head scratcher . '' Rick Snelsire , a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Pakistan , said Monday that the embassy had not received any information about an American being detained by Pakistani security forces . Gadahn , 31 , also known as Azzam the American , was indicted on charges of treason and providing material support to terrorists in 2006 . The U.S. government has offered a $ 1 million reward for information leading to his capture . He is the first American charged with treason since 1952 . Reports of an arrest Sunday came hours after Islamist Web sites posted video of Gadahn praising a November massacre at Fort Hood , Texas . On the video , Gadahn said the Army major charged with gunning down 13 people `` lit a path '' for other Muslim service members to follow . Authorities have targeted several key Islamist figures in Karachi -- the heavily populated port city and financial capital of Pakistan that , for some time , has functioned as a hideout for Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers . A city of 13 million -- with some estimates saying there are 100,000 new arrivals a month -- Karachi has seen an influx of Pashtuns from the tribal border region with Afghanistan . Many fled there during fighting and Pakistani military offensives in the Northwest Frontier Province and Waziristan , making Karachi a comfortable place for the Taliban to blend in and count on a network of supporters .

The Chinese-made knockoffs were placed in containers with false bills of lading , which are the shipping documents used to determine a cargo 's point of origin and destination . `` One bill of lading claimed a container held ` noodles , ' when in fact it contained counterfeit Nike sneakers , '' the news release said . After the bogus goods cleared inspection at the New Jersey port , they were transported to New York-area warehouses , where they awaited distribution to retail customers . According to the news release , the bribes were paid directly to an undercover agent whose `` near-daily '' conversations with the suspects were secretly recorded or monitored . The undercover agent posed as a `` corrupt longshoreman 's union official , stationed at Port Newark , who had the ability to clear imported cargo through the United States customs and border security measures without detection or seizure , '' the news release said . The 10 suspects are charged with conspiring to smuggle goods into the U.S. , smuggling goods into the U.S. and trafficking in counterfeit goods , the news release states .

Authorities allege Wong and Cheng charged smugglers a premium to transport goods around the New York area . On Wednesday , Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents raided a house in Brooklyn used as KT Express ' base of operations and three other locations . Federal agents seized $ 80,000 in cash and two KT Express trucks allegedly used in the operation , the news release said .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with public health officials in 42 states to determine the cause of an outbreak of a particular type of salmonella called Typhimurium . Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods . According to CDC sources , at least 388 people have been infected with this strain since September 3 , but most cases occurred between October 1 and December 31 , the disease agency said . About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness , and patients have ranged from two months to 98 years of age . California is reporting the highest case count with 55 , followed by Ohio with 53 cases , Massachusetts with 39 , Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20 . The other 37 states are each reporting anywhere from one to 19 cases . The eight states that have not reported any cases connected to the outbreak are Montana , New Mexico , Louisiana , Mississippi , South Carolina , Florida , Alaska and Hawaii . King Nut peanut butter was identified as the source of an outbreak that may have contributed to one death in Minnesota , state public health officials said Friday in a news release . CNN was unable to reach the company for comment . CDC has not identified what food or foods might be causing this outbreak . CDC officials and state public health workers are conducting case control studies , which means they 're tracking down people who have been infected as early as September to determine what they may have consumed , to find a common cause . Learn more about salmonella '' The Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are in contact with the CDC , but without a determination of the cause of the outbreak , their involvement is limited . Various strains of salmonella have been linked to previous outbreaks , caused by contaminated eggs , meat , poultry , vegetables , pet food and even peanut butter . Contaminated tomatoes were blamed for a salmonella Typhimurium outbreak in fall 2006 , which sickened at least 183 people in 21 states . Most of the victims had diarrhea and fever for about a week . Nobody died in that outbreak . Salmonella infections are caused by bacteria and if necessary can be treated with antibiotics , although some strains have become resistant to these drugs , according to the CDC Web site . Most people infected will develop diarrhea , fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection , and their illness can last up to a week . Most recover without any treatment , but some may suffer dehydration and in severe cases require hospitalization . The youngest and oldest patients and chronically ill people with compromised immune systems are at highest risk for severe complications , according to the National Institutes of Health . Until a cause of the outbreak is confirmed , the CDC is recommending the following : Consumers should thoroughly cook meats , poultry and eggs . They should also avoid consuming raw or unpasteurized milk and other dairy products . Produce should be thoroughly washed as well . Avoid cross-contamination of uncooked meats and produce to prevent spreading any potential salmonella . Frequent washing of hands during food preparation can also help reduce cross-contamination .","question":""}
{"answer":"JOHANNESBURG , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Africa has refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend an international peace conference in Johannesburg this week , a presidential spokesman said . The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . The Tibetan spiritual leader and Nobel Laureate did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa 's interest for him to attend , said Thabo Masebe . South Africa thinks that , if the Dalai Lama attended the conference , the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship it will host next year . `` We can not allow focus to shift to China and Tibet , '' Masebe said , adding that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China . The Dalai Lama 's fellow laureate , Archbishop Desmond Tutu , said he would boycott the event . Watch the controversy surrounding South Africa 's decision '' Former president F.W. De Klerk , another laureate , backed Tutu , saying in a statement that he would also not participate in the conference if the Dalai Lama remained excluded . De Klerk said that the decision to refuse the visa made a `` mockery '' of the peace conference . `` The decision to exclude the Dalai Lama is irreconcilable with key principles on which our society is based including the principles of accountability , openness and responsiveness and the rights to freedom of expression and free political activity , '' he said . `` South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democracy and should not allow other countries to dictate to it regarding who it should , and should not admit to its territory - regardless of the power and influence of the country . '' A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the decision . The Tibetan government in exile thinks that China has pressured many countries to refuse a visit by the Dalai Lama , according to Chhime Chhoekyapa , an aide in Dharamsala , India . The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . The peace conference was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa 's role as a human-rights champion ahead of its hosting of soccer 's World Cup next year . It was to bring together Noble Laureates and top soccer officials . In addition to Tutu and De Klerk , laureates Nelson Mandela and Martti Ahtisaari , Sepp Blatter , president of soccer 's international governing body , and actress Charlize Theron were invited to attend .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Open golf championship had a humble beginning when 11 players in 1895 completed on a nine-hole course in Newport , Rhode Island . Tiger Woods celebrates his triumph over pain with victory in the 2008 U.S. Open Since then it has gone on to become one of the most prestigious golf events in the world . Now in its 109th year the tournament has produced some truly unforgettable golf . Here CNN takes a look at some of the greatest moments in the history of the shoot-out . Disagree with our assessment of the best moments in U.S. Open history ? Let us know by posting your comments on the Sound Off box below . 1 Tiger Woods plays through pain 2008 Woods had struggled throughout the tournament at Torrey Pines with a fractured left leg but was still in contention heading into the final round . The American , who was visibly in pain , managed to summon enough strength to force a play-off with Rocco Mediate after he sunk a 12-foot put on the 72nd green . Woods ' mental tenacity then shone through as he maintained his concentration levels to defeat Mediate with a birdie on the 18th hole in the subsequent play-off to claim his 14th major championship . 2 Arnold Palmer 's remarkable comeback 1960 Few people would have considered Palmer a contender to lift the title at Cherry Hills Country Club when he began his final round in 15th place -- seven strokes behind leader Mike Souchak -- but what followed was one of the greatest comebacks in golf history . Palmer ousted Ben Hogan and then Jack Nicklaus with a virtually flawless round of 64 to finish on four under and take the U.S. Open crown for the only time in his career by two shots . 3 Ben Watson 's chip 1982 There was little to choose between Watson and Jack Nicklaus when the pair came up against each other at Pebble Beach at a time when they were both vying for the title as the best golfer on the planet . In the final round Watson struck perhaps the most famous shot in U.S. Open history , when he produced an audacious chip from a bad lie in thick rough for a birdie on the 71st hole to move a shot clear of Nicklaus before eventually winning the championship by two strokes . 4 Tiger Woods wins by record margin 2000 Old Tom Morris ' achievement of a major victory by the record margin of 13 strokes in the British Open in 1862 had not been broken for 138 years , but at the peak of his powers Woods was also to add that accolade to his collection . He finished 15 strokes ahead of second-placed Ernie Els at Pebble Beach and also became the first player in the history of the U.S. Open to finish at double-digits under par as part of his ` Tiger Slam ' when he held all four major championship titles . 5 Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie collapse 2006 Australia 's Geoff Ogilvy was handed the U.S. Open trophy when two of his rivals for the title pressed the self-destruct button . Ogilvy had earlier chipped in at the 17th and holed a brave putt at the 18th to set the target at five over par for victory . Montgomerie dropped two shots on the 18th hole when a first major title seemed to be within his grasp and moments later Mickelson , who needed only a par to secure the title , also suffered a case of the last-hole jitters and double-bogeyed to completed the double collapse . 6 Ben Hogan puts crash behind him 1950 With heavily bandaged legs after a near-fatal car accident 16 months earlier , which left medical experts predicting he may never walk again , Hogan defied the odds to lift the title at Merion Golf Club . He had struggled to find form in the build up to the tournament which led to some commentators predicting his career was over . But Hogan proved he was made of sterner stuff as he defeated Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio in an 18-hole playoff to win his second of four U.S. Open titles . 7 Tony Jacklin dominates in 1970 Europe was without a U.S. Open winner since Willie Macfarlane 's victory in 1925 but Jacklin was able to end the 45-year hiatus and give fans across the pond a moment to savor on a challenging course at the Hazeltine National Golf Club . Jacklin produced some superb golf and what made the victory all the more impressive is that he led the event from start to finish , eventually taking the title by seven shots with a margin that has been bettered only by Tiger Woods . 8 Payne Stewart wins four months before death 1999 Famed for his eccentric patterned trousers and ivy caps Stewart won the last of his three major titles at the Pinehurst Resort . Having first won the U.S. Open in 1991 Stewart clinched his second title in style when he rolled in a superb 20-foot par putt at the 18th hole which he celebrated with fist pump over the hole . He was unable to defend his title after he died in a plane crash four months later at the age of 42 . 9 Francis Ouimet 's shock win 1913 As the leading players of the era Harry Vardon and Ted Ray from Great Britain were hot favorites to land the title at The Country Club in Brookline . But the pair were shocked by the performance of the relatively unknown 20-year-old American who became the first amateur to win the U.S. Open after victory in an 18-hole play-off . Ouimet 's modest background saw him turned into a folk hero and the unlikely victory also helped raise the profile of the sport which had been considered the preserve of the elite up to that point . 10 Glover conquers Mickelson and Duval 2009 American journeyman Lucas Glover denies Phil Mickelson , a perennial bridesmaid at the event , a fairytale victory at Bethpage Black . It was the 29-year-old 's first major title , but what was of greater note was the fact Glover won with a final round three-over-par 73 in tough and windy conditions , holing only one birdie on the final day .","question":""}

Jack Kemp , a former congressman from New York , was the GOP 's vice presidential candidate in 1996 . A onetime professional football player , Kemp served nine terms in Congress as a representative from New York and was former Sen. Bob Dole 's running mate in 1996 . He was a leading advocate of `` supply-side '' tax cuts , advancing the argument that cutting taxes would boost economic growth and yield more revenue for the federal government . `` The only way to oppose a bad idea is to replace it with a good idea , and I like to think that I have spent my life trying to promote good ideas , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview .

Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a two-day visit . He also met with President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders on Wednesday . The negotiations over the natural gas supply had stalled for more than a year due to disagreements over price . If an agreement can be reached , the deal would see Russia supply China with up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas every year . `` The trade volume will increase significantly , and this will change the fact that the economic cooperation between the two countries lags behind the political cooperation , '' said Zhao Huasheng , director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University . `` Together with cooperation in other economic fields , China and Russia will become real strategic partners in economic terms , '' he added . Recent years have seen a steady increase in trade between the two countries . According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce , bilateral trade volume in the year to July increased by 37.4 % to a record $ 42.2 billion . The ministry forecasts that this will reach a new record in 2011 -- possibly in excess of $ 70 billion . `` The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has reached to an unprecedented level , '' Putin said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua agency .

{"answer":"MIDDLESBROUGH , England -- Middlesbrough have confirmed that midfielders Fabio Rochemback and Gaizka Mendieta and striker Dong Gook Lee have all been released . Middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of re-signing Brazilian midfielder Fabio Rochemback . The Premier League club had an option to extend Brazilian Rochemback 's deal by another two years , but manager Gareth Southgate has decided to let him go . `` We both feel that the time is right for Fabio to have a fresh challenge , '' Southgate said . `` He is a talented footballer and I think he 's just had his best season for us , while it was fitting that he should bow out against Manchester City on Sunday with probably his best performance in a Middlesbrough shirt . '' The 26-year-old joined Boro from Barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the Teesside club . He signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in Sunday 's 8-1 victory over City . Rochemback , who netted seven times for Boro , played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 UEFA Cup final , a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with Sporting Lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer . Mendieta , 34 , was one of football 's costliest players when he joined Lazio from Valencia for 48 million euros in 2001 , but he disappointed and joined Barcelona and then Boro on loan . The former Spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004 , but has not played for the first team since December 26 , 2006 . `` It was a difficult situation for a player of Gaizka 's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning , '' added Southgate . `` I made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team . `` That did n't work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players . '' South Korean international Lee joined Boro on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in January 2007 . He scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early February . Southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to sign a new contract at the Riverside . The 35-year-old Australian joined Boro from Bradford City in a $ 3 million deal in February 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club . His deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension , prompting reports of interest from a host of European clubs . `` We are talking to Mark . I 'd like him to stay . His experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing , '' said Southgate . `` He is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in World Cups , in Europe , in cup finals and so on . `` We have to negotiate and see where we go , but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them . `` Mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge , whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him , whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here . '' Southgate also confirmed they have offered striker Tom Craddock and right-back Tony McMahon one-year extensions to their current deals , which run out this summer . Brazilian Rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for Greek club AEK again next season . The 36-year-old had decided to quit after AEK were denied the title because Olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player . `` The truth is that at the end of the championship , I felt great disappointment and a -LRB- sense of -RRB- injustice , but the love and support I have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... I have decided to stay at AEK next season , '' Rivaldo said in a statement on the club 's Web site . Olympiakos lost 1-0 on February 3 , but Greek sports authorities gave them the points because Apollon played Roman Wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season . Apollon 's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected on April 21 . Olympiakos finished the season with 70 points , two ahead of AEK , for their 11th title in 12 years . Rivaldo , who has played at AC Milan and Barcelona and starred in Brazil 's 2002 World Cup victory , spent three seasons at Olympiakos from 2004 . He moved to AEK last year after a contract dispute . Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club . The 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances . `` He has come a long way in a short space of time so I congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts , '' said manager Juande Ramos . `` Jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself . '' However , Tottenham goalkeeper Radek Cerny has left the club .

McGuinness , a former leader of the IRA , is now deputy first minister of Northern Ireland . Accepting his party 's nomination Sunday , he said republicans have an obligation to `` heal the wounds of their actions . '' McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces . In recent years , he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process . He referred to a recent upsurge in violence in the province in his speech Sunday . `` I know there will be a very strong temptation for people to drag us back to the past . God knows there are enough of them trying to do so , in a violent sense , at the moment , '' he said . He described himself as a man of peace who can work across sectarian lines . `` People see me very much as a peacemaker , but , more importantly , they see me as a peacemaker who can be trusted , '' he said . `` I have every confidence that the peace process will be strengthened by my participation in the presidential election . '' `` I am proud to have served in government alongside unionists , '' he said , referring to those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom rather than uniting with the republic to the south . `` I can work with anyone . Times have changed in the North . '' Sinn Fein won 14 seats in the Irish parliament , the Dail Eireann , in elections this year . The party 's leader , Gerry Adams , moved from his west Belfast constituency in Northern Ireland to win a parliamentary seat in the republic , topping the poll in the Louth constituency . McGuinness will step down temporarily as deputy first minister in Northern Ireland 's power-sharing government during the election campaign , to be replaced by Education Minister John O'Dowd , Sinn Fein said . If elected , he would resign from his position in Northern Ireland . Ireland 's president is a largely ceremonial role , with national elections held every seven years . The president is the guardian of the constitution and has the power to refer contentious laws to Ireland 's Supreme Court . Mary McAleese has been the president since 1997 and is nearing the end of her second term of office . McAleese hosted a historic visit to Ireland by Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II in May , days before U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in the country . Elections are due to be held October 27 . On Friday , Irish Senator David Norris said he intends to re-enter the race . Norris -- previously tipped to be the first openly gay president of Ireland -- withdrew from the contest August 2 . He abandoned his bid after it emerged he had made a plea for clemency for a former lover convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in Israel in the 1990s . However , Norris told Irish television Friday night he had changed his mind and is seeking support to relaunch his campaign following a `` consistent outpouring '' of public support . He now has to secure political nominations to get his name on the presidential ballot paper . An opinion poll published Sunday showed Labour 's Michael D. Higgins leading Norris , who might be backed by the Fianna Fail party . But the Sunday Independent\/Millward Brown Lansdowne poll was completed before Norris said he was rejoining the race and before Sinn Fein put McGuinness ' name forward .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The stepfather of a missing Maryland boy was charged Thursday with first-degree murder after the boy 's mother was found dead , police said . Curtis Lopez , 45 , was arrested Thursday morning in Charlotte , North Carolina , after a warrant was issued , said Chief Tom Manger of the Montgomery County , Maryland , police . An Amber Alert has been issued for the boy , 11-year-old William McQuain , who remains missing , police said . Homicide detectives from Montgomery County were on their way to Charlotte on Thursday . `` Our focus and our priority now is locating William McQuain , '' Manger told reporters Thursday . He held up two pictures of the sixth-grader , one a class picture and the other showing him in a baseball uniform . The case began Wednesday afternoon when a friend of the boy 's mother reported her missing , saying he had not seen her for about two weeks and that he was concerned for her welfare , Manger said . Police learned her son had not been in school since Sept. 30 . When detectives arrived at the woman 's home in Germantown , they found Jane McQuain , 51 , dead in her bedroom with evidence of trauma to her upper body , Manger said . Her son was not there and the woman 's vehicle , a Honda CRV , was gone . Lopez was McQuain 's husband and had been known to frequent her residence but did not appear to live there , Manger said . Witnesses told police they saw him recently at the home , removing property and loading it into McQuain 's Honda , he said . The car was found Thursday morning , but police would not reveal where . Detectives contacted Lopez on Wednesday night , before they found McQuain 's body , Manger said . Once the body was found and the case was ruled a homicide , Lopez , based on his inconsistent statements , became a person of interest , he said . `` We were hoping that we would find -LRB- William -RRB- with Mr. Lopez and we did not , so we are asking for the public 's help in locating 11-year-old William McQuain , '' Manger said . `` My hope is that he may be with a family member or a friend that perhaps has no idea what 's occurred with his mother , but as time goes on it becomes , I guess , more and more of a long shot that that 's the case , '' he said . Jane McQuain was probably dead for 10 to 12 days before police found her , Manger said . Police believe Lopez may have had a residence in North Carolina , Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County police told CNN , but they have few other details linking him to the area . William McQuain is described as a light-skinned African-American , about 5 feet tall and weighing about 85 pounds . Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call 911 , police said .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Participation in government health insurance programs -- particularly those aimed at children -- increased from 2006 to 2007 , leading to a decrease in the number of Americans lacking insurance , the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday . The Census Bureau says 15.3 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in 2007 . Overall , 45.7 million people , or 15.3 percent of U.S. residents , did not have health insurance in 2007 , the bureau said in releasing reports on poverty , income and insurance . That represents a decrease from the 2006 level of 47 million , or 15.8 percent . The decrease came as a surprise , as the number of uninsured Americans had been expected to rise for a seventh straight year . It also gives a boost to proponents of expanding government health-care plans such as the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP . In December , President Bush signed legislation that extends SCHIP federal funding through the end of March 2009 . That action came after Bush vetoed two congressional attempts to expand the program . In vetoing one of the measures , Bush said the proposed expansion `` moves our country 's health-care system in the wrong direction . '' The percentages of people covered by private health insurance and by employment-based health insurance both decreased slightly in 2007 , the Census numbers showed , although the number of those covered by employment-based insurance , 177.4 million , was not statistically different from 2006 . However , the percentage of people , including children , covered by government health insurance programs increased to 27.8 percent in 2007 from 27 percent in 2006 . The number of children under 18 without health insurance fell to 11 percent , or 8.1 million -- lower than the 2006 numbers of 11.1 percent and 8.7 million . See a state-by-state breakdown of uninsured Americans '' Meanwhile , participation in Medicaid , the government insurance program for low-income Americans , increased to 13.2 percent and 39.6 million in 2007 , up from 12.9 percent and 38.3 million in 2006 . Using a three-year average from 2005-2007 , data showed that Texas had the highest percentage of uninsured , with 24.4 percent , the bureau said . With 8.3 percent , Massachusetts and Hawaii had the lowest estimates for uninsured rates , according to the Census Bureau , but the two were not statistically different from Minnesota -LRB- 8.5 percent -RRB- , Wisconsin -LRB- 8.8 percent -RRB- and Iowa -LRB- 9.4 percent -RRB- . Hawaii also did not differ statistically from Maine -LRB- 9.5 percent -RRB- , it said . But `` even with the overall drop in uninsured Americans , the 45.7 million uninsured number for 2007 exceeds the combined population of 24 states plus the District of Columbia , '' a group called Families USA said in a written statement . The group says on its Web site it is `` dedicated to the achievement of high-quality , affordable health care for all Americans . '' Being uninsured is a stark reality many Americans live with daily . They include Linda Pendleton of Greensboro , North Carolina . Pendleton was unable to afford private coverage when the convenience store where she worked stopped offering insurance to its employees two years ago . It worked out fine , she said , until she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer last month . Unable to work , she moved in with her daughter and her three grandsons . She has applied for Medicaid and disability , but has yet to receive a response . `` So right now I 'm trying to pay for everything , '' said her daughter , Randi Sharp . But that 's not easy . With two of her sons disabled , Sharp stays at home to care for them . Her eldest son receives disability payments of $ 632 per month , which supports the family , she said . The father of Sharp 's children is supposed to pay support , but `` he up and left and the court ca n't find him . '' Though her monthly rent is $ 600 , Sharp said her landlord has cut her some slack . And she goes to churches for her food and did n't buy her sons school clothes this year , she said . Meanwhile , her mother is so dragged down by her reaction to the chemotherapy that she `` can barely do things for herself , '' Sharp said . And even relatively modest fees threaten to cut short her mother 's chemotherapy treatments . `` If I do n't give them cash on Thursday , if I do n't give them $ 70 , they 're not going to see her any more , '' Sharp said . A yard sale over the weekend and trips to the pawn shop have helped . So does cutting back on food . `` There are days I go without even eating for two or three days , '' she said . `` I 've exhausted all of our resources . '' And while the number of those living without health insurance is down , one economist points out , `` we 're still seeing an unraveling of the private health insurance system . '' Overall , insurance premiums have continued to rise faster than wages or inflation , putting the squeeze on companies and on individual families , said Elise Gould , an economist at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute . With 2007 being an economic peak year , `` you 'd think some of the economy would have helped our workers , '' she said . `` We 're not seeing that . '' Another underlying problem , she said , is that people purchase cheaper insurance but often have substandard coverage -- something they often do n't find out until they experience a health-care emergency and must pay a large amount out of pocket . Ron Pollack , executive director of Washington-based Families USA , issued a statement saying , `` It is ironic that , at the very time the Bush administration tried to cut back Medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend children 's health coverage , the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer-sponsored health coverage . It demonstrates the importance that the next president should protect , and not undermine , the public health safety net . '' Although the uninsured rate for children living below the federal poverty level decreased to 17.6 percent in 2007 from 19.3 percent in 2006 , children in poverty were more likely to be uninsured than all children , the Census numbers showed . Still , the numbers of uninsured children decreased across all ethnic groups . However , people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as `` uninsured '' by the Census Bureau , meaning the actual number could be higher . In other data , the real median household income increased 1.3 percent nationwide , reaching $ 50,233 , the Census Bureau said . The official poverty rate remained statistically unchanged , although the number slightly increased -- 37.3 Americans lived below the poverty level in 2007 , up from 36.5 million in 2006 . African-American households had the lowest median income , with $ 33,916 , compared with $ 54,920 for non-Hispanic white households , the data showed . The median income for Hispanic households was $ 38,679 . Household income rose in the Midwest and South , declined in the Northeast and remained unchanged in the West , the bureau said . As defined by the Office of Management and Budget and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index , the Census Bureau put the weighted average poverty threshold for 2007 at $ 21,203 for a family of four ; $ 26,530 for a family of three ; $ 13,540 for a family of two ; and $ 10,590 for individuals . Working women earned 78 percent of the corresponding male salaries , according to the bureau . Median earnings increased for both men and women following three years of decline .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq , President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada . On Wednesday in Kansas City , Missouri , Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that `` then , as now , people argued that the real problem was America 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , '' according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House . `` Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left , '' Bush will say . `` Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president will say . The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility , citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam , according to the excerpts . `` Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' Bush will say . On Tuesday , Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said , `` President Bush 's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history . `` While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government . It is time to change direction in Iraq , and Congress will again work to do so in the fall . '' The White House is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the American Legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad . President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in Iraq until the report comes out in September . Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government '' It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill , particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . Earlier this month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin . Bush 's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . A recent CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq . In addition to his analogy to Vietnam , Bush in Wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia , including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` In the aftermath of Japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy . Then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' Bush will say . `` Today , in defiance of the critics , Japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' Speaking about the Korean War , Bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that America 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges , America never broke its word , '' Bush will say . `` Without America 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war , millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

Three Drug Enforcement Administration special agents were among the dead , according to the DEA , which did not identify them . The agents were first DEA agents to be killed in Afghanistan . `` Like all those who give their lives in service to America , they were doing their duty , and they were doing this nation proud , '' President Obama said at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville , Florida . `` Now , it is our duty , as a nation , to keep their memory alive in our hearts and to carry on their work , to take care of their families , to keep our country safe , '' Obama said . It was the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years , according to CNN records . The NATO force ruled out enemy fire in the crash that killed four Americans and said enemy action was not thought to be the cause of the other . A helicopter went down in the west of the country after a raid on suspected drug traffickers . Seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians were killed , according to an ISAF statement . Fourteen Afghan service members , 11 U.S. service members and one U.S. civilian were injured in the crash . Monday 's crash marked the second-deadliest incident in the agency 's 36-year history , according to entries on the DEA 's Web site . The deadliest incident for the DEA occurred August 27 , 1994 , when a plane carrying five special agents crashed in the Peruvian Andes during a reconnaissance mission , according to the DEA 's Web site . One of Monday 's helicopter crashes occurred after the helicopter was returning from a raid on a compound , ISAF said . The joint international security force killed more than a dozen enemy fighters while searching the compound , ISAF said .

Our grief is compounded when we have such a significant loss on one day , '' Col. Wayne Shanks , an ISAF spokesman , said in a written statement . ISAF is not announcing the names of the dead or which branch of the service they were in , pending the notification of their relatives . The DEA has had a presence in Afghanistan for four years . The agency said Monday that it is increasing its presence in Kabul to up to about 50 agents . CNN 's Carol Cratty and Brooke Baldwin in Washington contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Ukrainian general has been arrested in connection with the murder of a journalist nearly nine years ago , the country 's president said Wednesday . Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko has labeled Georhiy Gongadze 's killing the country 's most important case . Gen. Alexei Pukach was detained Tuesday in connection with the killing of Georhiy Gongadze , who was abducted in September 2000 and later found decapitated . The Gongadze killing is the country 's most important criminal case , President Viktor Yushchenko said in a statement on his Web site . `` To me , it 's a question of honor to resolve the murder of Georhiy Gongadze . It 's a question of whether or not good or evil prevails , '' Yushchenko said . Organizations ranging from the European Union to the Committee to Protect Journalists have demanded that Ukraine bring the journalist 's killers to justice . Pukach had been on the run for years before he was seized Tuesday in a joint operation by the Security Service and the prosecutor general 's office , Yushchenko said . He has already been interrogated once and is cooperating with the investigation , the president added . The Committee to Protect Journalists welcomed the arrest , it said in a statement to CNN . `` As the suspected organizer of the killing , Pukach could point the investigation to those who ordered the crime nine years ago , '' said Nina Ognianova , the organization 's Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator . `` Only with the masterminds behind bars would Ukrainian authorities be able to reverse the impunity in Gongadze 's assassination , '' her statement said . Three former police officers were convicted last year of killing Gongadze and given jail sentences of 12 to 13 years , the Committee to Protect Journalists said at the time . There has long been suspicion that top Ukrainian government officials were involved in the murder . `` Gongadze , the pioneer editor of critical Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda -LRB- Ukrainian Truth -RRB- , had long angered authorities with his highly critical reports detailing corruption in -LRB- former President Leonid -RRB- Kuchma 's administration , '' CPJ said last year , when the three men were sentenced . Kuchma has long denied involvement in the killing . Pukach was a high-ranking interior ministry official at the time Gongadze disappeared . His former boss , Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko , was found dead at his country house in March 2005 , days before he was to be questioned by prosecutors over the killing of the journalist . The Ukrainian security service , the SBU , suggested Kravchenko killed himself , and the dead man 's successor quoted a suicide note , according to Russian media . `` Please forgive me , I 've become a victim of political intrigues of President Kuchma and his people . I 'm leaving you without a twinge of conscience . Farewell , '' then-Interior Minister Yuli Luzenko quoted the note as saying . But Myroslava Gongadze , the slain journalist 's widow , noted Kravchenko had two bullets in his head . `` I think it has to be investigated , '' she said of the death . `` He was the main player of my husband 's murder ... he was the person who -LSB- took -RSB- the order and who gave the order , '' she told CNN at the time of Kravchenko 's death . Kuchma had been implicated in the murder by critics who cited secretly recorded audio tapes in which the president allegedly ordered his staff to get rid of the journalist . Kuchma vehemently denied those charges .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces additional child sex charges involving two more alleged victims , bringing the total to 10 , according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly . Sandusky was arrested Wednesday and charged with four counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and two counts of unlawful contact with a minor , allegedly involving two men who were boys at the time of the encounters . `` Today 's criminal charges were recommended by a statewide investigating grand jury , based on evidence and testimony that was received following the initial arrest of Sandusky on November 5th , '' Kelly said in a news release . Each count is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and $ 25,000 in fines . The former coach also faces one new count of indecent assault and two counts of endangering a child 's welfare , each punishable by up to seven years behind bars and $ 15,000 in fines . And Sandusky faces a single new count of indecent assault and two counts of corruption of minors . `` As in many of the other cases identified to date , the contact with Sandusky allegedly fit a pattern of ` grooming ' victims , '' Kelly said in the news release . `` Beginning with outings to football games and gifts ; they later included physical contact that escalated to sexual assaults . '' Sandusky , who maintains his innocence , will face a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday . His attorney , Joe Amendola , blamed prosecutors for turning the case into `` a media circus , '' adding that Sandusky would have willingly turned himself in . Sandusky surrendered when he faced the initial charges . Amendola , who learned of the new charges from a CNN producer in his office , said he was unhappy prosecutors did not make sure he was aware of the arrest before the media . `` I had a few words with the prosecutor , '' Amendola told CNN 's Kathleen Johnston . `` What I told them essentially is , if we are going to play hardball , both sides can play and I was a pretty good pitcher in my day . '' `` The question begs to be asked , why would the attorney general 's office decide not to tell me ... and why did they go to his house and take him out in handcuffs ? '' Amendola said . `` I think the answer is self-explanatory . '' Amendola said he expected his client might not be able to post the $ 250,000 bail before Thursday because he did n't have time to make the arrangements . The alleged victims -- identified by authorities as Victim 9 and Victim 10 -- are believed to have encountered Sandusky at The Second Mile charity , a nonprofit organization he founded for underprivileged children . Victim 9 was between 11 and 12 years old when he first met the former coach back in 2004 . Sandusky allegedly gave the boy gifts and money and took him to university football games , according to the grand jury presentment . The alleged victim testified he would make overnight visits to Sandusky 's home and stay in a basement bedroom . He described a pattern of sexual assaults over a period of years , the grand jury said . `` The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help , knowing that Sandusky 's wife was upstairs , but no one ever came to help him , '' the report states . Sandusky allegedly met Victim 10 , then about age 10 , in 1997 after a counselor recommended the boy attend the charity `` because of difficulties in his home life . '' That witness said Sandusky performed oral sex on him and indecently touched him in an outdoor pool on campus , according to the grand jury . A grand jury report made public last month detailed 40 charges of rape and molestation against the former coach in a child sex abuse scandal that , at the time , involved eight alleged victims . Wednesday 's announcement came on the heels of an attorney 's statement on behalf of a 19-year-old man who stepped forward with claims that Sandusky gave him whiskey and sexually abused him , also in 2004 . The man pointed to a single incident at the university 's football building , according to attorney Chuck Schmidt of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . He was 12 at the time and it allegedly occurred while he was staying overnight during Second Mile activities , the attorney said . It is not clear if the man can be identified as Victim 9 . Schmidt says he plans to file a lawsuit against Penn State , the charity and Sandusky in coming weeks . `` He thought he was the only person this had ever happened to and when he found out there were others , that gave him enough courage to come forward , '' he said of his client . The Second Mile , meanwhile , reported Wednesday that it had `` lost significant financial support '' in the wake of the scandal and plans to reduce its staff . `` We at The Second Mile are saddened by the need to make these cutbacks ; however , our foremost concerns reside with the victims of the horrific abuse reported by the Attorney General and with the children we serve , '' the charity said in a written statement . Sandusky , the longtime Penn State defensive coordinator , has said he only `` horsed around '' with the disadvantaged boys in his care . An attorney for some of the alleged victims Monday blasted Sandusky 's recent interview with The New York Times in which he attempted to clarify his relationships with young people . `` If I say , ` No , I 'm not attracted to young boys , ' that 's not the truth , '' Sandusky said , according to the interview published Saturday . `` Because I 'm attracted to young people -- boys , girls . '' His lawyer , who was present at the interview , spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is `` not sexually '' attracted to them . `` Right . I enjoy -- that 's what I was trying to say -- I enjoy spending time with young people . I enjoy spending time with people , '' Sandusky added . `` I mean , my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young . '' The former coach told the paper that prosecutors had twisted his decades of work with troubled youths as part of his charity .

{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes , whom officers shot dead in 2005 , mistaking him for a suicide bomber . The police offered `` a further unreserved apology '' for the death of de Menezes in 2005 , plus an undisclosed compensation package , the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement . `` All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved , '' the statement added . De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7 , 2005 . The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations , including one that found police acted illegally . A jury found in 2007 that London 's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting . It did not examine the cause of death . Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him . They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train , which would have given them a reason to shoot . But the coroner at the inquest , who acted as the judge , had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing . They returned an open verdict in the case , meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death . De Menezes ' family called the proceedings a `` whitewash '' because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing . De Menezes was killed July 22 , 2005 , a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system . Two weeks earlier , four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus , killing 52 people and wounding 977 . The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers . Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes , 27 , believing he was one of the suspects . They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station , where they chased him onto the platform and into a train , and shot him dead . The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action . `` We made a most terrible mistake , '' Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time , adding police needed to learn from the incident . `` I am sorry . '' The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair . CNN 's Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former `` enemy combatant '' who was held in a South Carolina Naval brig for six years with no charges was sentenced Thursday to eight years and four months in prison , a Justice Department spokesman said . Ali al-Marri pleaded guilty in federal court in Illinois in May to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization . He could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison . `` This administration is committed to bringing terrorists to justice for their crimes , '' Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said . `` Al-Marri , who has been in U.S. custody since December 2001 , was dispatched by the highest levels of al Qaeda to carry out its terrorist objectives in America . '' A defense attorney for the Qatari citizen , who had been a student at Bradley University in Peoria , Illinois , when he was arrested , said the judge ruled on a lesser sentence to reflect the nearly six years al-Marri already spent at the Naval brig in Charleston , South Carolina . `` We 're pleased with the result , '' said the attorney , Larry Lustberg . `` Mr. al-Marri is also very pleased . '' Al-Marri was transferred to a federal prison in Illinois in March after President Obama ordered a review of his case . The case was ultimately referred to the Justice Department , which filed charges . The Pentagon said he trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to court documents filed earlier in the case . According to a copy of his plea agreement , al-Marri admitted that he `` knowingly conspired and agreed with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed '' to provide support to al Qaeda and to work under the organization 's direction and control . `` Between 1998 and 2001 , the defendant attended various training camps because he wished to engage in jihad , '' the document said . While in the training camps and in al Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan , he was known by the name Abdul-Rahman al-Qatari , according to the plea agreement . Mohammed approached al-Marri in 2001 about his offer to assist al Qaeda , the plea agreement said . `` The defendant was instructed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to enter the United States no later than September 10 , 2001 , with an understanding that he was to remain in the United States for an undetermined length of time , '' the documents said . Al-Marri applied to Bradley using the same e-mail address he used to communicate with Mohammed , the plea agreement said . At Bradley , he `` rarely attended classes and was in a failing status by the end of his first semester . '' On September 21 , 2001 , al-Marri traveled to another central Illinois university and created five e-mail accounts under different aliases , the documents said . `` By this time , the defendant knew that al Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States and fully understood why Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had directed him to be in the United States before that date . '' He used the new e-mail accounts to inform Mohammed of his whereabouts and activities , and also gave him his cell phone number in encoded format , according to the plea agreement . In addition , he conducted online research `` related to various cyanide compounds . The defendant 's focus was on various cyanide substances ... the defendant reviewed toxicity levels , the locations where these items could be purchased , and specific pricing of the compounds , '' the documents said . He also explored obtaining sulfuric acid . An almanac found at al-Marri 's residence was bookmarked `` at pages showing dams , waterways and tunnels in the United States , '' the plea agreement said . Al-Marri initially was arrested on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 . But his continued confinement without charges mushroomed into a major legal case before federal prosecutors filed charges in February . The Supreme Court ruled on March 6 that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges , and granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss his challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely without charges . He was transferred to civilian custody and taken to Illinois in March . The court 's ruling , however , meant that the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain accused terrorists and other criminals in the United States remains unresolved .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of deceased Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi will file a war crimes complaint against NATO with the International Criminal Court , a lawyer representing the family said Thursday . Members of the family believe NATO 's actions led to Gadhafi 's death last week , said Marcel Ceccaldi . `` All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court , '' Ceccaldi , a French attorney , said . NATO responded that it `` conducts its operation in strict conformity with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions . '' In a statement Thursday , a NATO official said , `` At no time during Operation Unified Protector has NATO targeted specific individuals . '' The ICC had previously issued a warrant for Gadhafi 's arrest , accusing him of crimes against humanity . The ICC still has warrants for the arrest of Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . Questions surround the death of Moammar Gadhafi , who eluded forces loyal to the National Transitional Council for months . Video shows Gadhafi was alive when captured by the opposition . He died from a shot in the head , officials said , but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear . The United States said it supports an independent investigation , as called for by the United Nations and by Libya 's new leadership . Ceccaldi said the Gadhafi family 's complaint will be filed in the coming days . `` Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial , '' he added . Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of the NATO military operation , said earlier this week that NATO `` did not get involved in anything beyond what was our legal mandate and we remain well within the mandate assigned to us by the North Atlantic Council . '' While Gadhafi survived an airstrike in the Sirte area shortly before he died , Bouchard said NATO did not know the former Libyan leader was in the convoy . `` We saw a convoy , and in fact we had no idea that Gadhafi was on board , '' Bouchard said . Some vehicles in the convoy were carrying weaponry , and seemed to present a potential threat to the population , he said . The news came as the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to end NATO 's military operations in Libya .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The late country music icon Hank Williams was among the 2010 Pulitzer Prize winners announced Monday . The Pulitzer Prize Board awarded a posthumous special award to Williams , who died in 1953 at 29 , for his lifetime achievement as a musician , praising the country legend for `` his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life . '' The board , chaired by Miami Herald Executive Editor Anders Gyllenhaal , decided on the `` special citation '' after a confidential survey of experts in popular music . `` The citation , above all , recognizes the lasting impact of Williams as a creative force that influenced a wide range of other musicians and performers , '' said Sig Gissler , administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes , in a statement . `` At the same time , the award highlights the board 's desire to broaden its Music Prize and recognize the full range of musical excellence that might not have been considered in the past . '' Only a few other musicians have earned special citations in music in recent years : jazz composers Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane each received one in 2006 and 2007 , respectively , and Bob Dylan captured one in 2008 . Williams set the country music standard with his music , including songs such as , `` Your Cheatin ' Heart , '' `` Cold Cold Heart , '' `` I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry '' and `` Jambalaya .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A grand jury Tuesday indicted three New York police officers on charges related to the alleged sodomy of a man on a Brooklyn subway platform in October . Michael Mineo says New York Police officers sodomized him inside a Brooklyn subway station . The indictments came after two other officers told the grand jury they saw Officer Richard Kern assault 24-year-old Michael Mineo with a police baton in October , authorities said . `` I think that both officers who stepped forward acted in a responsible , if not a heroic , way , '' Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said Tuesday . `` I think both of them deserve a great deal of praise for doing that . '' Kern , 25 , faces charges including aggravated sexual abuse , a felony that could put him in prison for up to 25 years if convicted . Officers Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz , both 26 , face charges including hindering prosecution . Both are accused of trying to cover up the incident by falsifying records . All three pleaded not guilty Tuesday at their arraignment before Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge John Walsh . Authorities say Kern and Morales approached Mineo , a Brooklyn tattoo artist , on October 15 after seeing him walking down a street smoking what they believed to be marijuana . As the uniformed officers approached Mineo , he fled . The officers chased him into a Brooklyn subway station , where they apprehended him on the platform , authorities said . Cruz and a transit policeman , Kevin Maloney , joined the other officers and helped to subdue Mineo , who was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back , according to authorities . Mineo claims Kern used his retractable police baton to sexually assault him on the subway platform . Witnesses said they heard Mineo 's cries . Mineo 's lawyers said he showed officers he was bleeding , but they provided no medical attention and did n't call a supervisor as Mineo requested . Kern gave Mineo a summons for disorderly conduct , and Mineo was released , authorities said . Mineo sought treatment at an area hospital , and hospital staff notified police that they treated a patient who claimed to be a victim of police brutality . Hynes said that based on forensic information gathered by a medical examiner and the police lab , there was enough evidence to move the case to a grand jury . The grand jury started hearing testimony October 28 . Maloney and another officer testified that they had seen Kern assault Mineo with his baton . After Tuesday 's arraignment , Kern was released on $ 15,000 bail ; the other two officers were released on their own recognizance . Cruz 's defense attorney called the case `` paper thin . '' Kern 's attorney said Mineo 's accusations were motivated by money , saying Mineo is planning to file a civil suit . Mineo 's attorneys would not explain why their client ran from police . The attorneys said they plan to file a civil suit , but they did not give information on the damages they plan to seek . Mineo said he still suffers the effects of the attack . `` I relive this every day , '' Mineo said Tuesday . `` Nobody should have to go through something like this . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda ended days of speculation Sunday by confirming that one of its chemical weapons experts was killed last week along with three other `` heroes , '' according to a statement posted on a radical Islamist Web site . Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar was among four `` heroes '' killed last week , an al Qaeda statement says . The statement , dated July 30 , provided no details on how or when the al Qaeda operatives were killed . It was signed by al Qaeda 's top leader in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu al-Yazid . A senior Pakistani official said last week it was a `` near certainty '' that weapons expert Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar died in a U.S. airstrike Monday in Pakistan 's tribal region . Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said that if reports of the strike were true , the U.S. violated Pakistani sovereignty . Umar , who is also known as Sheikh Abu Khabab al-Masri , was on the U.S. State Department 's list of 37 wanted terrorists , and the U.S. had offered $ 5 million for information leading to his death or arrest . `` Although Abu Khabab is gone , he left behind him a generation who will seek revenge and punishment with God 's help , '' the al Qaeda statement said . `` And while the ` expert ' is gone , he left behind experts who were taught and trained under his hands throughout the years . '' Umar was killed along with Abu Mohammed Ibrahim Bin Abi al-Faraj al-Masri , Abd al-Wahab al-Masri , and Abu Islam al-Masri , the statement said . Umar , a 55-year-old Egyptian , ran a chemical-and-explosives training camp for terrorists in Derunta , Afghanistan , before the fall of the Taliban , U.S. officials said . `` Since 1999 , he has distributed training manuals that contain instructions for making chemical and biological weapons , '' according to the U.S. Rewards for Justice program . `` Some of these training manuals were recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan . '' Rewards for Justice said Umar was believed to be in Pakistan , continuing to train al Qaeda terrorists and other extremists . He was reportedly near the site of a U.S. airstrike more than two years ago in the Pakistani mountain village of Damadola . The strike targeted a dinner gathering believed to include terrorists . Initial reports that Umar died in the January 2006 strike later proved erroneous .","question":""}
{"answer":"Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a move that will further complicate international efforts to get Middle East peace negotiations restarted , the Israeli government Tuesday approved the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern Jerusalem neighborhood that was seized by Israel in 1967 . The Israeli Interior ministry announced that a district planning committee had approved the construction of the housing and that the decision would be open for public objections for the next 60 days . The move brought quick condemnation from Palestinians who claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state . Palestinian officials said the action proved that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not serious about making peace . `` He said at the United Nations he was giving his hand in peace , but actually , he is digging in the land to build more settlements , '' said Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Shtayyeh . The Israeli move also drew international criticism , with British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemning it while U.S. officials expressed disappointment . `` Settlement expansion is illegal under international law , corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace , '' Hague said in a statement . `` We call on the government of Israel to revoke this decision . '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the United States was disappointed by Israel 's announcement , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it `` counterproductive to our efforts to resume direct negotiations between the parties . '' Last week , the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States , the European Union , the United Nations and Russia -- called on Israel and the Palestinians to resume peace talks within a month and set the end of 2012 as the deadline for their completion . The Quartet also called on both sides to `` to refrain from provocative actions , '' a veiled reference to Israeli settlement building in land Israel occupied after 1967 . Shtayyeh called Israel 's move '' a slap in the face of the Quartet and the whole international community , which is saying ` stop settlements . ' '' In an interview with the daily Jerusalem Post , Netanyahu defended Israel 's right to build in Jerusalem . `` We plan in Jerusalem , we build in Jerusalem . Period . The same way Israeli governments have been doing for years . '' As for possible U.S. government criticism of the move , Netanyahu declared that the Americans `` know this -- they have followed this a long time . There is really nothing new . '' In the interview , Netanyahu also said Israel would not initiate another settlement freeze to get talks started again . `` We already gave at the office , '' he said , referring to a 10-month freeze enacted by his government last year . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to convene a PLO leadership meeting Thursday to discuss the Quartet proposal for the resumption of talks , but Netanyahu 's comments and the announcement of Israeli construction on land that Palestinians maintain should form part of their future state is bound to further widen the large gap between the two sides . Abbas has said repeatedly that the Palestinians will not return to negotiations until Israel halted all settlement construction and accepted 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks . Israel , for its part , has maintained that negotiations should begin with no pre-conditions .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Senate Wednesday approved a bill to put new rules in place for intelligence agency eavesdropping on suspected terrorists . Communication technologies like mobile phones have made the 1978 FISA bill out of date , supporters say . The bill also effectively protects telephone companies from being sued for cooperating with a government surveillance program launched in the wake of the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . The White House pushed hard for the provision , with a threat to veto the bill if it did not contain protection for phone companies . The vote was 69-28 , with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois voting in favor . Republican candidate Sen. John McCain of Arizona was not present for the vote . President Bush said Wednesday afternoon he will sign the bill , calling it `` vital '' and `` long overdue .

It will : Opponents argued that the provision creating a judicial review of cases against the telecommunication companies is a sham . The bill essentially grants immunity to the telecommunication companies , the opponents said , because all of the telephone carriers received government certifications saying their participation in the program was legal . Obama was criticized for backing away from his early opposition to the bill by liberal bloggers and individuals commenting on his campaign Web site . Before voting for the bill , Obama voted for an amendment offered by Sen. Christopher Dodd , D-Connecticut , that would have stripped the language granting immunity to telecommunications companies .

{"answer":"Moscow , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of opposition demonstrators marched in front of the parliament building in Kiev , Ukraine , Saturday , protesting a deal reached earlier this week to extend Russia 's military presence in the former Soviet Republic , national news media reported . Parliamentary opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- told protesters Saturday that the ratification of the treaty must be prevented at all costs . She claimed that Yanukovych is `` selling out '' Ukraine , has `` openly embarked on the path of destruction of -LSB- Ukraine 's -RSB- national interests , and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state 's sovereignty , '' according to a transcript of the speech on her website . After the deal was signed Wednesday by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017 . Saturday , protesters reportedly adopted a resolution calling the agreement an `` unprecedented act of national treason and disgrace , '' and calling on all opposition groups to unite against it . According to Tymoshenko 's website , some 10,000 people gathered at the rally . But Ukrainian national news agency UNIAN estimated the number of protesters at 5,000 . The deal extends Russia 's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol , Ukraine , for an additional 25 years , in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine . The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices , which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine . The dispute affected not only Ukrainians , but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine . The two countries had been at odds ever since the `` Orange Revolution '' swept Yanukovych 's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005 . Throughout his time in office , Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia 's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol . The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017 . `` The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet 's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia , '' Yanukovych said Wednesday . `` We understand that the Black Sea Fleet will be one of the guarantors of security on the Black Sea . '' The Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych , who hails from predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine , trounced Yushchenko in national elections last January . The Russian president said the new deal added a `` concrete and pragmatic dimension '' to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians . Opposition groups in Ukraine , however , were quick to denounce the agreement . Yuschenko 's `` Our Ukraine '' party said the treaty would lead to the `` Russification '' of Ukraine . Opposition activists decided Saturday to stage another protest in front of parliament April 27 , when the deal will be put to a ratification vote .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Polish court has ordered the detention of a man accused of holding his daughter captive for six years and repeatedly raping her , ultimately fathering two children with her . The accusations recall the case of Josef Fritzl , who kept his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children . The man , whose name was not released , was arrested Monday , Polish national police said in a statement . The court on Tuesday ordered him jailed for three months pending a trial . The charges against him were not immediately known . Police said they arrested the man at the train station in Siedlce , a town between Warsaw and the border with Belarus . Police said they believed he was trying to escape abroad . The investigation began last week when the man 's 21-year-old daughter approached police in Siemiatycze , in eastern Poland , accompanied by her mother , police said . The daughter spent several hours talking with a policewoman , detailing her alleged ordeal over the past six years , police said . She described living through a `` hell '' that involved rape , beatings , and being kept as a slave , police said . In 2005 , the woman said , she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Wroclaw , in southwestern Poland , police said . Two years later , in 2007 , she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Siemiatycze , in eastern Poland , also near the border with Belarus , police said . Both times , the woman told police , she left the baby in the hospital , a common practice in Poland when the mother wants to give her children up for adoption , police said . Police did not say how the daughter managed to escape her alleged ordeal or whether the mother was aware of what had gone on . Police themselves acknowledged many facts were still unclear . `` There are still a lot of questions to which answers have to be found , '' the statement from the national police said . The case has drawn comparisons to the shocking incest case in Austria in which Josef Fritzl is accused of holding his daughter captive in an underground network of tiny rooms for 24 years . Fritzl repeatedly raped his daughter , Elisabeth , and fathered seven children with her , six of whom survived . All of the children were born in captivity . That case became public when Elisabeth 's oldest child , 19-year-old Kerstin , became ill and fell unconscious in April . Elisabeth persuaded her father to let her bring Kerstin to a hospital , where staff grew suspicious and called police , who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse . Kerstin and her family are now recovering and slowly adapting to modern life , Austrian authorities have said .

No date for Obama 's meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader has been announced . The Dalai Lama has speaking engagements scheduled in the United States in late February and in May . Earlier Tuesday , China warned that ties between two of the world 's superpowers would be strained if Obama met with the Dalai Lama . `` It will seriously undermine the foundation of Sino-U.S. political relations , '' said Zhu Weiqun , a Communist Party official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama . `` We will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes . '' Zhu issued his warning during a news conference to discuss the lack of progress made during five days of talks between China and the Dalai Lama 's representatives . Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of advocating for Tibetan independence from China . `` The two sides had sharply divided views , '' Zhu said . `` We have been accustomed to such clash of viewpoints . It 's been the norm rather than the exception . '' In explaining Obama 's intention to hold the meeting , Burton said the Dalai Lama `` is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader , and the president will meet with him in that capacity . `` As the president has expressed , we expect that our relationship with China is mature enough where we can work out issues of mutual concerns -- such as climate , the global economy and nonproliferation -- and discuss frankly and candidly those issues where we disagree , '' Burton said . `` The president is committed to building a positive , comprehensive and cooperative relationship with China . '' Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government , but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese , the most numerous ethnic group in China . Zhu said there would be no compromise on China 's control of Tibet . Representatives from the two sides have met eight other times , but have reached no consensus on the issue of autonomy . The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . He lives in exile in the north Indian hill town of Dharamsala . Burton said the United States `` considers Tibet to be a part of China , and we have human rights concerns about the treatment of Tibetans .

Britain spent 2.3 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.69 billion -RRB- last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed . Under a European Union directive , Iceland owes compensation to Britain . Iceland 's parliament passed a bill last week authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds , but President Olafur Ragnar Grimmson refused to sign it Tuesday . It means there will now be a public referendum on whether to approve the bill . It also puts into question whether Britain can get repaid . `` We expect Iceland to live up to its obligations , '' said a British Treasury spokesman , who was not authorized to give his name . `` We support them in finding a way to do that . '' Similar comments came from Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos , whose government spent 1.3 billion euros -LRB- $ 1.87 billion -RRB- to cover bank losses in the country . Despite his refusal to sign the bill , Grimmson told CNN Wednesday that Iceland will not shirk its duty to repay the money . `` Iceland recognizes its obligations under this agreement , '' he said . Resolving the issue , he added , `` is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries . '' Grimmson acknowledged that the referendum puts repayment in doubt , though he said at the very least , Icelandic opinion polls show the vote will be `` very close . '' He did not explain how Iceland would repay the money if voters reject the bill . Britain and the Netherlands said it was too early to speculate on what might happen if voters in Iceland vote no , but both Bos and the British Treasury spokesman said it would have negative consequences internationally for the small Atlantic nation . `` If the referendum goes against us , then I think Iceland will have a big problem because they will have shown themselves to be very unreliable partners in the international financial scene , '' Bos told CNN . Bos said non-repayment of the funds would affect `` the long-term interest of the Iceland economy and the Iceland people . '' In a statement Tuesday , Grimmson said the reason he refused to sign the bill was so it would go to a referendum , which is required by law in such a case . He said he received a petition over the weekend , signed by a quarter of the electorate , urging the decision be put to a public vote . `` It is the cornerstone of the constitutional structure of the Republic of Iceland that the people are the supreme judge of the validity of the law , '' Grimmson said in the statement . The law passed by Iceland 's parliament would compensate Britain and the Netherlands by 2024 . The International Monetary Fund approved a loan of $ 2.1 billion to Iceland in November , making repayment of the British and Dutch funds a requirement . It is unclear how the IMF loan would be affected if Icelandic voters were to reject the repayment bill .","question":""}

{"answer":"WASHAKIE COUNTY , Wyoming -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal agents have apprehended accused child molester Edward Eugene Harper , who was on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list , an FBI official said Thursday . Edward Eugene Harper is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle since fleeing Mississippi . Harper , 63 , is accused of molesting two girls , ages 3 and 8 , in his neighborhood in Hernando , Mississippi , more than a decade ago , the FBI said . The FBI said it received a telephone tip in June at the Denver office regarding Harper , and brought a SWAT team and a hostage negotiation team to apprehend him in rural Wyoming on Thursday . He surrendered without incident , the FBI said , and later admitted his identity to agents . Harper was living in a 1979 truck with a camper top in the southern portion of Washakie County 's Big Horn Mountains , the FBI said . He is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle , moving from place to place and earning a living by doing odd jobs and herding sheep , the FBI said in a statement . He was indicted in April 1994 with conspiracy to commit sexual battery , fondling a child and sexual battery . He failed to appear for a scheduled court hearing and a state warrant was issued for his arrest in October 1994 . He was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution , a federal offense . The FBI added him to its 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list last year . Before living in Mississippi , Harper had been a ranch hand , working with cattle and sheep in Montana and Wyoming , the FBI said in its release on Harper last year . He has also worked as a truck driver , the agency said . According to the FBI , Harper subscribed to `` sovereign citizen '' ideology and claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen , a group that rejected the authority of the U.S. government . The group became famous for an 81-day standoff with federal agents in Montana in 1996 . But after the arrest and conviction of many of its members , the group essentially disintegrated , according to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center . `` As far as I know , '' they do n't exist , he said . `` Most of them went to prison and there was nothing left .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attacks in January and February by Sudanese forces on Darfur villagers are described in a U.N. report as `` violations of international humanitarian and human rights law . '' Between January and February , Sudanese forces killed 115 people -- including women , children and elderly -- in air and ground attacks on four Darfur villages , according to the report . Prepared by the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur , the report says attacks in January and February point to a deliberate plan to destroy civilian infrastructure . Helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft targeted the villages while armed militias rode in on horses and camels to force about 30,000 people from their homes , according to the report . The attacks were `` carried out during a major military push by the Sudanese government to regain control of West Darfur 's northern corridor , and drive out an insurgent group , '' it said . The village of Saraf Jidad , Sudan , was attacked three times in January , while the villages of Sirbal , Silea and Abu Suruj were attacked within hours of each other on February 8 , UNAMID said in the report . The militias and the Sudanese armed forces looted , vandalized and burned homes , schools , shops , community centers and other buildings in the villages , the report said . Sometimes , buildings were burned with people inside , it said . The attacks `` amount to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , '' they said . `` The scale of destruction of civilian property , including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population , suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy . '' The Sudanese government had no immediate response . However , last week , Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir accused the international media of `` exaggerating '' the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and Somalia . He said the crisis in Darfur is a `` media fabrication '' and that in most of the region there is little or no conflict and people are living normal lives , he said . Citing Sudanese government statistics , el-Bashir said fewer than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and fewer than 500,000 have been displaced . International figures , including U.N. data , put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced . The conflict began five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government . Sudan 's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed , which have allegedly committed the worst atrocities against Darfur 's local communities . Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the United Nations of widespread human rights abuses . El-Bashir rejects claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday called on President-elect Barack Obama to govern from the middle , as her party sat poised to gain its widest House majority in 15 years . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , celebrates election victories Tuesday night in Washington . According to projections , Democrats in the House were on track Wednesday to increase their majority by at least 18 seats , a margin that would give Obama a formidable tool to push his legislative agenda after his January 20 inauguration . Democrats took at least 22 seats from Republicans in Tuesday 's election , with the GOP taking four seats from the Democrats , according to CNN projections . With winners yet to be called for eight of the House 's 435 seats , Democrats were projected to win 254 seats , with Republicans having 173 . `` I do n't know what the final number will be , '' Pelosi said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference on Capitol Hill . `` But it will be well over 250 . It 's a signal of the change that the American people want . '' Pelosi , D-California , said she hoped Obama would `` bring people together to reach consensus '' on issues that concern Americans . `` A new president must govern from the middle , '' she said . Topping her agenda , she said , would be `` growing the economy , expanding health care , ending dependence on foreign oil and ending the war in Iraq . '' When he woke up Wednesday morning , Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said , he felt like the boy who stubbed his toe , the character in a quote from President Lincoln , who said : `` It hurts too bad to laugh , and I 'm too big to cry . '' Duncan also called on the president-elect to govern from the center and warned that if Democrats moved too far to the left , Republicans could take back seats in the 2010 midterm elections . `` The last two times Democrats controlled the House , Senate and the presidency , they choked on the bone of responsibility , '' he said . `` They lurched far to the left and introduced the country to President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Newt Gingrich . '' Among Tuesday 's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut , whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party could n't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes . Shays ' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House . Shays was seeking his 11th full term . Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change '' Heading into Election Day , the Democrats had a 235-199 House majority . The Democrats ' gains come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority . Here are highlights of other races from Tuesday with projected winners : Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio , including that of Rep. Steve Chabot , who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates . CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus . Just two years earlier , Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio 's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat . Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula . Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP 's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest . \u2022 In New York , Democrats won three Republican seats , including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election . In one of the open races , Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City , defeating the GOP 's Robert Straniere . Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland , who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh . In a rematch of a 2006 race , former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican . \u2022 Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minnesota , was projected to survive a race that tightened after she accused Obama of having `` anti-American views . '' She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting . Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama 's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views . Bachmann 's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg . \u2022 In Florida , Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win . Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney , and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller . However , brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart , who represent districts in southern Florida , held off their Democratic challengers . Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term , defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez . \u2022 Democratic incumbents were n't invulnerable in Florida . Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger , Tom Rooney . Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district . But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money . Mahoney admitted to causing `` pain '' in his marriage , but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet . \u2022 Republican incumbents in two California districts maintained their House seats -- Rep. Ken Calvert defeated Democrat Bill Hedrick , a former teacher , and Brian Bilbray defeated Democrat Nicholas `` Nick '' Alexander Leibham , an attorney . In June 2006 , Bilbray narrowly won a special election to fill the vacant San Diego seat that once was occupied by disgraced former Rep. Randy `` Duke '' Cunningham . \u2022 In Pennsylvania , Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell . Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district `` a racist area '' and `` redneck . '' \u2022 The House 's third-ranking Republican , Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida , was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he would n't run again for a leadership post , saying he wanted to return his focus `` to crafting public policy solutions for America 's generational challenges . '' He is currently the GOP conference chairman . \u2022 In a heavily Republican district near Houston , Texas , Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson . Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges . \u2022 In Ohio 's 11th District , Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones . Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek . Tubbs Jones , who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs , died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm . \u2022 The House 's first two Muslim members , Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana , won their contests Tuesday . Carson has won his first full term ; he had succeeded his grandmother , the late Rep. Julia Carson , in a March special election . \u2022 There was a party change in the race to represent New Jersey in the House . Democrat John Adler , 48 , defeated Republican Chris Myers , 42 , a Navy combat veteran . Adler , an attorney , sponsored New Jersey 's 2006 law prohibiting smoking in indoor public places and workplaces . He was also the sponsor of a law toughening car emission standards in the state . \u2022 Democrats took power from Republicans in Idaho , too . Walt Minnick beat Republican William Sali in a race for the House . Minnick has an MBA and law degree from Harvard University and served as a Nixon White House staffer in the early 1970s before starting a 21-year career at a wood-products maker . Not all 435 seats will be decided immediately . Two Louisiana districts used Election Day for primary runoffs ; the general election for those seats will be December 6 .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama has ordered a review of security screening processes after Friday 's botched terror attack on a U.S. airliner , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday . Appearing on the ABC program `` This Week '' and the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' Gibbs said Obama is receiving regular briefings by his national security staff on the incident in which a suspect allegedly tried to detonate an explosive device on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , The Netherlands , making its final approach to Detroit , Michigan . The suspect , 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was on a broad watch list of 550,000 names since last month , Gibbs said . That list does not automatically bring tighter screening of individuals , Gibbs said , and Obama has ordered a review of the procedures for determining which people on the list undergo more stringent checking . Obama also called for `` a review to ... figure out why an individual with the chemical explosive he had on him could get on a plane in Amsterdam and fly into the United States , '' Gibbs said on NBC . `` The president is very confident that this government is taking the steps that are necessary to take our fight to those who seek to do us harm , '' Gibbs said on the ABC program . Authorities on Sunday focused their investigation on how a lone traveler smuggled explosives aboard the Northwest Airlines flight and who might have helped him . Abdulmutallab , who had a multiple entry visa to the United States , was charged Saturday in a federal criminal complaint . Q&A : Why did security checks fail to spot explosives People on the flight described a chaotic scene that began with a popping sound followed by flames erupting at Abdulmutallab 's seat . Jasper Schuringa , a Dutch passenger on the flight from Amsterdam , leaped across the aisle to grab the suspect , who according to authorities suffered burns on his legs . Schuringa told CNN he saw that Abdulmutallab was holding a burning object between his legs . `` I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away , '' Schuringa said . He said he heard fire extinguishers as he pulled Abdulmutallab out of his seat and dragged him to the front of the plane . In Nigeria , Abdulmutallab checked no baggage on his trip that originated in Lagos on a KLM flight to Amsterdam , where he changed planes to the Northwest flight , according to Harold Demuren , director-general of Nigeria 's Civil Aviation Authority . The suspect had a shoulder bag and went through the normal check-in process with his passport and U.S. visa scanned , Demuren said Sunday . The multiple-entry U.S. visa was issued in London , England , in June 2008 with an expiration date of June 2010 , Demuren said . Abdulmutallab then passed through a walk-through metal detector and put his shoulder bag through an X-ray screening machine , Demuren said . He also said the suspect underwent secondary screening at the boarding gate for the KLM flight , according to officials of the Dutch airline . The father of the suspect recently contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns his son was planning something , a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday . The father -- identified by a family source as Umaru Abdulmutallab -- contacted the embassy `` a few weeks ago '' saying his son , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , had `` become radicalized , '' the senior administration official , who is familiar with the case , told CNN . A family source told CNN that the elder Abdulmutallab -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC , one of Nigeria 's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in Nigeria 's capital , Abuja , and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official . The family source said Abdulmutallab went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son . The source , who lives at the family home in Kaduna in northern Nigeria , said the son informed his family in the text message that he was leaving school in Dubai to move to Yemen . He implied that he was leaving `` for the course of Islam . '' The family member said Abdulmutallab `` had no family consent or support , '' adding he `` absconded to Yemen . '' Abdulmutallab 's information about his son was forwarded to the National Counter-Terrorism Center , and Abdulmutallab was added to a general watch list , a senior administration official said . But the official said `` the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list . '' In addition , the official said there was `` no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa '' back in June 2008 . A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into Abdulmutallab said investigators are still trying to trace his past travels . `` Investigators are looking into any al Qaeda connections and whether he had help and training from Yemen , '' the law enforcement official said . A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device on the plane contained PETN , also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate , a highly explosive chemical compound . In addition , FBI agents recovered what appear to be remnants of a syringe near Abdulmutallab 's seat , believed to have been part of the device . The family source said Abdulmutallab received a college degree at the University College London , where spokesman Dave Weston said a man named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab was enrolled in the mechanical engineering department between September 2005 and June 2008 . When Abdulmutallab returned to Nigeria from London , he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in Cairo , Egypt , or Saudi Arabia , the family source said . The family refused because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people . He went to Dubai instead , the source said , where he sent a text message saying he had gone to Yemen to start a new life and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his SIM card . Abdulmutallab 's father notified the U.S. Embassy with information on his son , saying the family feared he went to Yemen to participate in `` some kind of jihad . '' A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday `` was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used . '' Yemeni authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt , according to a Yemeni official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media . But , the source said the country 's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect 's alleged link to the country is officially identified . Earlier Saturday , the Netherlands ' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that Abdulmutallab had gone through `` normal security procedures '' in Amsterdam before boarding the flight and those were `` well-performed . '' The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups , a U.S. administration official said . Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Mississippi , who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security , said the attempted act of terrorism would be the focus of an oversight hearing next month . Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D-West Virginia , also said his Senate Commerce Committee would hold a hearing on the incident . In Nigeria , the government said Saturday that it `` received with dismay the news of attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. airline '' and has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident . Officials from the Nigerian Embassy in Washington have flown to Michigan `` to gain Consular access '' to Abdulmutallab , the embassy said in a statement Saturday . The embassy said it plans to cooperate with U.S. authorities . An official with the Transportation Security Administration told CNN there will be increased security measures taken on international flights to the United States . The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before the flight . There will be no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bayern Munich capped a successful week by returning to the top of the German Bundesliga with a 2-1 victory away to title rivals Schalke on Saturday despite having a man sent off in the first half . Louis Van Gaal 's team followed up the midweek Champions League victory over Manchester United with a win that puts them a point clear of previous leaders Schalke ahead of Wednesday 's trip to England for the second leg of the quarterfinal . Bayern took a 2-0 lead after only 26 minutes as Franck Ribery and Thomas Muller scored within 60 seconds of each other , but Schalke 's former Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi reduced the deficit soon after . The Bavarians had Hamit Altintop sent off for a second booking four minutes before halftime , but Schalke -- beaten by Bayern in the German Cup semifinals 10 days ago -- could not claim a point and had Marcelo Bordon dismissed at the end of the match . Bayern were again without Dutch forward Arjen Robben , who missed the United game with a calf problem , but surged into a two-goal lead when French playmaker Ribery fired home from a corner and Tuesday 's match-winner Ivica Olic set up Muller . Kuranyi followed up his double from last weekend with another strike from a pass by Rafinha , who was fouled by Altintop to see the Turkey international an early bath . Kuranyi should have leveled just before the break but missed from close range , and Schalke failed to seriously threaten the Bayern goal in the second spell . Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen suffered another blow to their title hopes with a 3-2 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which left the former leaders six points adrift of Bayern after a run of just one win in seven league outings . Frankfurt , who upset Bayern two weeks ago , moved up to eighth with a third successive win thanks to Maik Franz 's 89th-minute winner . Leverkusen led 2-1 straight after halftime through Stefan Kiessling 's second goal , but had Daniel Schwaab sent off three minutes later for a rash tackle on Umit Korkmaz . Caio leveled on 62 with a super long-range effort , and Franz snatched victory from close range . Borussia Dortmund consolidated fourth place with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen , scoring both goals in the first half through Kevin Grosskreutz and Neven Subotic before Aaron Hunt pulled one back in the 65th minute . Dortmund closed to with a point of Leverkusen , who hold the final Champions League place , and went four clear of fifth-placed Bremen . Stuttgart moved up to seventh with a 2-1 victory at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach , while Nuremberg moved three points clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Mainz . Bochum joined Nuremberg on 28 points with a 1-1 draw at third-bottom Freiburg , while bottom side Hertha Berlin earned a surprise 3-0 win at Cologne in Saturday 's late match thanks to two first-half goals from Raffael and a 75th-minute effort from fellow Brazilian Cicero .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ramping up pressure on Honduras ' interim government , the United States has revoked the visa of the beleaguered country 's leader , a senior Honduran official told CNN en Espanol on Saturday . Roberto Micheletti and his supporters say Honduras underwent a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup . De facto President Roberto Micheletti and 14 supreme court judges had their visas revoked , said Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez . Lopez said he , too , lost his visa privileges . The U.S. State Department recently announced that it would pull the visas of members of Honduras ' de facto regime . In recent weeks , the United States has stepped up its call for the current Honduran government to restore ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power . Zelaya was seized by the Honduran military in his pajamas and sent into exile on June 28 . On Wednesday , the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation , a U.S. government agency , voted to cut $ 11 million in aid to the government in Honduras , senior State Department officials told CNN . Prior to the vote , the board had only suspended the aid , the State Department said . The Millennium Challenge Account is a program started under the Bush administration to reward good governance . The agency 's cuts followed an announcement last week by the United States that it was terminating all nonhumanitarian aid to Honduras to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of an agreement known as the San Jose Accord . The accord calls for Zelaya 's return to power . The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya 's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits . The country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal . Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup . The United Nations has condemned Zelaya 's ouster and does not recognize Michiletti 's government . While the United States has called Zelaya 's ouster a coup , it has not formally designated it a `` military coup , '' which , under U.S. law , would have triggered a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid regardless . Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution . A presidential campaign in Honduras kicked off last week . However , the United States said it would not support the outcome of the elections unless Zelaya was restored to power .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Accused enemy combatant Ali al-Marri was served with an arrest warrant Tuesday and transferred out of U.S. military custody for the first time since 2003 , according to the U.S. Justice Department . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . Al-Marri 's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday . Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the Qatari man to the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the hearing . On Friday , the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss al-Marri 's challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely and without charges . The high court ruled that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges . The court 's ruling means there is no resolution of the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain people accused of terrorism and other crimes in the United States . The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in virtual isolation in a Navy brig in Charleston , South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . Al-Marri had been accused of being an al Qaeda `` sleeper agent , '' but until the indictment had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . The 43-year-old man will be sent at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . He subsequently issued a presidential memorandum ordering Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , saying it was `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri -- a legal resident of the United States -- had remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and were challenging the constitutionality of his detention . The Pentagon asserts al-Marri had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to a government filing with the Supreme Court .","question":""}

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New York 's Commission on Public Integrity is charging Gov. David Paterson with an ethics violation for accepting free tickets to the first game of last year 's World Series , the commission said Wednesday . Paterson violated the state 's restriction on gifts for public officials in October when he sought free tickets to the game in Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies , the commission said . The commission also said Paterson lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets . The governor 's office said it was reviewing the commission 's findings . `` Governor Paterson maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts , '' the office said . `` The governor takes this matter very seriously and intends to fully cooperate with any further inquiries or investigations , but believes the commission has acted unfairly in this matter . '' The governor could face an $ 80,000 fine for violating the state 's gift ban for public officials and up to $ 10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges . The commission has asked New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the Albany County district attorney to investigate whether Paterson or `` anyone else '' committed a crime during the governor 's interview with the commission and by causing a check to be back-dated . Paterson , who announced last week that he would not run for election to a full term , has faced controversy since news reports charged that his aide was involved in a domestic violence incident with a woman and that state police later allegedly pressured her to keep quiet . The aide , David Johnson , has been suspended without pay . Paterson has asked Cuomo , a possible contender for the governor 's office , to investigate the matter . Johnson was among the four guests who attended the October 28 game with Paterson , the Commission on Public Integrity said . He also was involved in obtaining the tickets , which cost $ 425 a piece , from the Yankees , the commission said in its notice of reasonable cause . According to the commission , the governor testified that he decided he should attend Game One of the World Series and directed Johnson to get tickets from the Yankees . The governor told his aide that the request should include tickets for his son , Alex , and his son 's friend . Johnson then told the governor 's scheduler , Matthew Nelson , to contact the Yankees about five or six tickets . Johnson said Paterson would be attending in a `` ceremonial capacity . '' Based on Johnson 's representation , the commission said , `` the Yankees did not expect payment for any tickets because the tickets were for official business . '' They had requested a letter from the governor 's counsel confirming that , and the counsel had sent a letter saying so , the commission said . The Yankees said they require such confirmation or payment when public officials request tickets , the commission said . However , the commission said , the governor did not participate in opening ceremonies for the game and was not announced to the crowd . He also did not meet with first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden 's wife , Jill Biden , who attended the game , or members of the Yankees organization , the commission said . In testimony , the governor said he always intended to pay for the tickets for his son and his son 's friend . He said he had taken a check to the game for the tickets , filling out the date and the $ 850 but leaving the payee section blank . `` While he had no opportunity to pay while at the stadium , the governor testified that he gave the check to Johnson and asked him to send the check to the Yankees , '' the commission said . However , the commission said that it had compared the handwriting on the check with that of the governor 's handwriting on other documents and that the governor did not write the check sent to the Yankees . `` The handwriting on the check that Johnson forwarded to the Yankees as payment for his ticket to Game One reveals that the same person who wrote and signed the governor 's check also wrote and signed Johnson 's check , '' the commission said . The check Paterson said he wrote is dated October 27 , the day before Game One , the commission said , although the governor said he had written the check on the day of the game . In its notice of of reasonable cause , the commission also cited testimony from the governor 's communications director , Peter Kauffmann , whom a New York Post reporter had asked about payment for the tickets . Kauffmann said that he had discussed the game several times with Paterson and Johnson and that the governor indicated to him that Yankees President Randy Levine , a law school classmate of Paterson 's , had invited Paterson to the game , the commission said . `` During this conversation , the governor said nothing to Kauffmann about his intention to pay for the tickets for his son or his son 's friend , nor did the governor mention anything about having previously written a check for $ 850 and giving it to Johnson as payment to the Yankees , '' the commission said . The reporter later told Kauffmann that the Yankees disputed Paterson 's account , saying Levine had never invited the governor to the game , the commission said . Kauffmann confronted the governor , who `` then conceded to Kauffmann that Levine had not explicitly invited him to Game One , '' the commission said . The commission also said the governor and his son attended last year 's Opening Day at Yankee Stadium and at Citi Field , where the New York Mets play . `` The governor testified that he did not pay for his ticket or his son 's ticket '' for either event , the commission said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An infant girl delivered prematurely from her mother , who has the swine flu virus , has died , hospital officials said Monday . Aubrey Opdyke was put into a medically induced coma to give the baby as much oxygen as possible . Parker Christine Opdyke was delivered 14 weeks early by doctors at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Florida 's Palm Beach County . Her mother , Aubrey Opdyke , was placed into a medically induced coma June 3 to help give the baby as much oxygen as possible . But doctors delivered Parker on Saturday after her mother suffered a collapsed lung last week . Aubrey Opdyke remains comatose and in critical condition in Wellington 's intensive care unit . `` Despite heroic efforts on the part of physicians and nurses , we are sad to announce that baby Parker Christine Opdyke has expired , '' said a written statement from the hospital . No other details were available Monday . Attempts by CNN to reach the family were unsuccessful . Even under the best circumstances , delivering a child at 27 weeks is a very early birth , Dr. David Feld , a Palm Beach County obstetrician and gynecologist , told CNN affiliate WPEC . `` When you have an infectious case , I do n't think you 're going to see that lung maturity as quickly , and I think that is the issue , '' he said . But , he said , now that Aubrey Opdyke is no longer pregnant , she will be able to fight for her own life . Palm Beach County has had 247 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus , known as swine flu , but only one death . In late June , a 25-year-old pregnant woman died , but her baby survived . Pregnant women have long been a prime concern of health care officials regarding the flu virus , but are of particular concern during this outbreak of swine flu . Pregnant women have always been advised to get a flu shot because they are at greater risk because of the weakened immune system resulting from their pregnancy . But the H1N1 epidemic has seen new complications and challenges . `` We have seen , with this virus , worse complications and severe infections in pregnant women , '' said Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` We 're urging women who are pregnant who develop fever or respiratory symptoms to seek care promptly . '' The CDC said it is vitally important for pregnant women to recognize the signs and symptoms , like fever and cough , to get to their doctor quickly and to begin taking antiviral medicines early on . `` I know that many pregnant women do n't want to take anything while they 're pregnant , '' said Schuchat . `` This is a situation where you need to be more worried about your health and the baby 's health . '' The CDC also recommends that pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available , in addition to an annual flu shot . `` For people who are at high risk , like pregnant women , planning to receive both vaccines is probably the right way to go , '' Schuchat said . The CDC 's advisory committee will meet later this month to make recommendations on at-risk groups who should receive the new vaccine .","question":""}
{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barely a year after the country celebrated its return to democracy , Pakistan is ensnared in a new political crisis . Riot police block a street on Thursday leading to a court building in Karachi , Pakistan . Thousands of lawyers planned a four-day march to the country 's capital , Islamabad , on Thursday , demanding that the government immediately reinstate judges whom the previous president ousted . The protesters plan a sit-in at the parliament building on Monday , and say they will continue their demonstrations indefinitely until their demands are met . At the same time , the country 's main opposition leader and his supporters have joined in the nationwide protests , but for reasons of their own . The government responded by banning political demonstrations in two of the country 's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh . It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday . The political chaos has forced the government 's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that 's on the verge of collapse . To understand the reasons behind Pakistan 's latest political chaos , one needs to keep three central characters in mind : What do the lawyers want ? The lawyers want President Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by former President Musharraf . Musharraf fired about 60 judges when he declared a state of emergency in November 2007 . The fired judges include 14 of 18 judges who sat on the Supreme Court , including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry . Critics say Musharraf sacked the judges because they were preparing to rule against the legitimacy of his third term in office . He had been re-elected president by a parliament stacked with his supporters , they said . After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year , the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office . The deadline came and went . Why have the judges not been reinstated ? One reason behind the delay , some experts have surmised , may be that the Supreme Court was expected to look into the controversial amnesty granted to former PPP leader Benazir Bhutto and her husband and current party head , Zardari , for corruption charges . When Bhutto was prime minister , Zardari was accused many times of corruption , stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks . Pakistanis derisively labeled him `` Mr. 10 percent . '' Zardari said the cases were politically motivated . He spent several years in jail on the charges but was never convicted . Bhutto herself faced corruption charges in at least five cases , but was not convicted . In October 2007 , with his popularity plummeting and under pressure from the West to hold elections , Musharraf allowed Bhutto to return from exile and participate by granting her and her husband amnesty . Bhutto was assassinated during a campaign rally . Her husband became head of the party and the new president of Pakistan . Why is the opposition protesting ? The country 's second-biggest party , the Pakistan Muslim League -- N -LRB- PML-N -RRB- , is led by opposition leader and former Prime Minister Sharif . Last month , the Supreme Court ruled that Sharif can not hold public office , citing a criminal record that dates to the late 1990s . The court also stripped Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , from his post as chief minister of Punjab -- the Sharif party 's power center . The Sharifs condemned the court 's decision as politically motivated . They accuse the court of acting at the behest of Zardari . Adding to their outrage , Zardari suspended Punjab 's parliament and imposed executive rule there for two months . The Zardari administration said the executive rule was needed to maintain stability in the province . Supporters of PML-N have rallied in large numbers opposing the ruling . Why did the court bar Nawaz Sharif from elected office ? The case against Sharif dates to the late 1990s , when he was prime minister . At the time , Musharraf was military chief . And Sharif feared Musharraf was plotting his ouster . When Musharraf was returning home from an overseas trip , Sharif refused the airliner to land . That order eventually led to Sharif 's conviction for hijacking and treason when Musharraf took power in a bloodless coup . Separately , Sharif also was convicted of corruption . He went into exile instead of prison , but returned to Pakistan to challenge Musharraf 's rule in late 2007 . However , the election commission barred Sharif from the parliamentary race . His brother , Shahbaz , was shut out because of financial irregularities , the commission said . The Supreme Court upheld the commission 's decisions . What does the turmoil mean for Pakistan ? The renewed tensions threaten to take the focus away from the government 's attempts to quash an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency in the country . At the same time , Pakistan 's economy is in shambles . The worsening security situation is part of the reason . Rising food and oil prices have also contributed to the crisis . In November , the International Monetary Fund approved a $ 7.6 billion loan to Pakistan to help the South Asian country of 170 million people avoid an economic collapse . Many in Pakistan worry that the latest turmoil could once again force the army on to the streets if it worsens . In its 61-year history , Pakistan has been under army rule more than half the time . For now , Gen. Ashfaq Kayani has said he will not interfere in political matters .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- Would you like to let AT&T know when your iPhone has dropped a call ? Well , now there is an app for that . AT&T on Monday released a new application called `` Mark the Spot , '' which lets iPhone users submit complaints about dropped calls , poor service coverage , and less-than-perfect voice quality . The application is free and available in the iTunes App Store . It uses GPS technology in the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS to pin point where the user is when experiencing the problems . For first generation iPhones , it uses cell tower-triangulation to get a fix on problem areas . Once the application is launched , users have several complaint options . They will see a screen that has buttons that let them report a dropped call , poor voice quality , or poor service coverage . AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said AT&T plans to use the data collected to identify trends and prioritize the company 's network investments . `` We think this is a great way to get customer feedback to improve our network , '' Siegel said . `` We are always looking for ways to make it easy for customers to share their experiences . And this app lets customers report issues . It logs the time and location and automatically forwards the information to our network planning team . '' iPhone owners have been complaining about AT&T 's network since the Apple iPhone went on sale in the summer of 2007 . Complaints mounted after the 3G version of the phone was released a year later in 2008 . And as more iPhone users come onto the network , more people , particularly in densely populated urban areas , such as New York City and San Francisco , have experienced problems with dropped calls and congested data networks . AT&T executives have not said that AT&T has a problem with its network . But executives , such as AT&T Chief Technology Officer John Donovan , have said that the company has seen a surge in data traffic attributed to iPhone users , who typically consume more wireless bandwidth than other AT&T wireless customers . AT&T has been upgrading its network to keep up with demand . But problems persist . And AT&T 's network recently got a poor ranking in terms of customer satisfaction in a Consumer Reports survey . Verizon Wireless , AT&T 's chief rival , has taken advantage of AT&T 's struggles with a series of advertisements that point out AT&T 's lack of 3G network coverage in certain parts of the country . Verizon is running advertisements that mock the Apple `` There 's an app for that , '' catch phrase with one that says , `` There 's a map for that . '' AT&T fired back with a lawsuit and an advertisements of its own featuring actor Luke Wilson , who points out AT&T 's strengths while taking a few shots at Verizon Wireless . AT&T recently dropped its lawsuit against Verizon . And Verizon , which had been suing AT&T over claims that it has the fastest 3G wireless network , also dropped its lawsuit against AT&T . Siegel said that the new `` Mark the Spot '' application was not prompted by the bad publicity around its network issues nor was it prompted by the current ad wars going on between AT&T and Verizon . Instead , he said that the application was simply a part of AT&T 's ongoing commitment to listening to customers . `` We are always looking at ways to get customer feedback in as timely a manner as possible , '' he said . `` That 's why we pay attention to Twitter , Facebook and blog . One of the great values of these social networking tools is that it 's a great way to get instant feedback . And it helps us identify problems . '' The `` Mark the Spot '' application can be downloaded onto all iPhones running version 3.0 or later of Apple 's operating system or it can be access using iTunes and synchronized to the iPhone via a PC or Mac . Siegel said that AT&T is testing the `` Mark the Spot '' app for other devices . And he said AT&T hopes to offer applications on other smartphones in the future . No date has been announced yet . And Siegel did n't specify which devices might get the new application , but considering that AT&T sells a lot of Research in Motion 's BlackBerry devices , it 's likely it will create an application for that device . The app could be offered through AT&T 's own application storefront or through RIM 's BlackBerry App World . \u00a9 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. . All rights reserved .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya has paid $ 1.5 billion to the families of terrorism victims , overcoming the final obstacle to full relations with the United States , the State Department said Friday . Police officers survey the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie , Scotland , in December 1988 . The payment ends Tripoli 's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation . President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer . David Welch , the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East , who negotiated the agreement , called Libya 's rehabilitation from a terrorist nation to a U.S. ally `` historic . '' The pact closes the book on a contentious period in U.S.-Libyan relations , which began in the 1980s with a series of attacks involving the two countries , including the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 , a German disco and U.S. airstrikes over Libya . U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya , a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure . This summer , the United States and Libya signed a deal for the State Department to create a $ 1.8 billion compensation fund to finalize the claims for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , and the 1986 bombing of La Belle disco in Berlin , Germany . It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s . Congress unanimously adopted the Libyan Claims Resolution Act , sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg , D-New Jersey , which cleared the way to end the feud and created the victim compensation fund . Under the agreement , Libya pays more than $ 500 million to settle remaining claims from the Lockerbie case and more than $ 280 million for victims of the disco bombing . It will also set aside funds to compensate victims of several other incidents blamed on Libya , although Libya has not accepted responsibility . In exchange , Libya will now be exempt from legislation passed this year enabling terrorism victims to be compensated using frozen assets of governments blamed for attacks . Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families . An initial payment of $ 300 million was received this month , after the opening of a U.S. trade office in Libya and a historic visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . Another $ 600 million was received Thursday and the remaining $ 600 million Friday , Welch said , adding that the families could start receiving payments within days . The remaining $ 300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986 . Libyans say dozens of people died in the U.S. air attack , including an adopted daughter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi . President Reagan ordered the attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi after two U.S. soldiers were killed and 79 Americans were injured in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing . The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 killed 270 people , including 189 Americans . Of the dead , 259 people died on board the plane and another 11 on the ground . Libya has paid 268 families involved in the Pan Am bombing $ 8 million each of a $ 10 million settlement . But it withheld the remaining $ 2 million owed to each family over a dispute regarding U.S. obligations to Tripoli . A group of relatives of Pan Am victims said in a statement Friday that they applauded Libya 's fulfillment of the agreement . `` The Pan Am 103 families deeply appreciate Sen. Lautenberg 's work to urge the administration to take every step to bring the agreement to fruition , '' spokeswoman Kara Weipz said in the statement . `` While our loved ones will never be forgotten , we are glad this chapter in our efforts is finally over . '' Ties between the two countries began to improve in 2003 , when Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program and began compensating Lockerbie victims . But lingering lawsuits prevented the two countries from fully normalizing ties . The State Department has said the deal was pursued on a `` purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party . '' Senior State Department officials said the formula was designed to respect Libyan sensitivities about compensating victims for incidents for which it has n't taken responsibility and also allow Libya to settle outstanding claims for the air strikes on Tripoli . Donations to settle Libyan claims were placed in the `` voluntary '' fund , from which each country involved in the claims draws the money to pay its citizens . Welch would not say exactly where the money came from but stressed that no American taxpayer money would be used to compensate Libya . The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya , including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador , which was held up until the payments were made . Lautenberg applauded the payment Friday . `` American victims and their families have waited decades for Libya to pay for its deadly acts of violence and today they have received long-overdue justice , '' he said in a statement . `` I am pleased that our relentless pressure and support for terror victims has led to this historic moment . '' Rice 's visit in September , the first by a secretary of state since 1953 , was hailed by both countries as a breakthrough . It followed months of negotiations between the two countries .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran may be holding a former FBI agent in a bid to exchange him for Iranians seized by U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007 , a U.S. senator suggested Tuesday . Christine Levinson , wife of Robert Levinson , went to Tehran in 2007 to try to learn her husband 's fate . Robert Levinson disappeared from Iran 's Kish Island in March 2007 . Iranian authorities have repeatedly said they do n't have any information on him , but that is widely doubted in the United States . `` On several diplomatic occasions when Bob Levinson 's name has been brought up to Iranian officials , the standard answer is , ` We do n't know anything about that . ' But the next thing out of the Iranian officials ' mouths are to discuss the matter of the Iranians held by the Americans in Irbil , Iraq , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , told reporters . `` You can draw your own conclusions . '' U.S. troops arrested five Iranians accused of being members of an elite Iranian military unit during a January 2007 raid in the Kurdish city of Irbil . They were accused of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq , but Iran said they were diplomats and accused the United States of violating international law by raiding a consulate . The United States said the men were taken at a liaison office that lacks diplomatic status . Two were released the next November . Nelson and Florida Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler , whose district includes Levinson 's Coral Springs home , are trying to jump-start efforts to find the missing man . Wexler said Iranian authorities have not assisted the Levinsons , saying they have `` zero knowledge '' of his whereabouts and are stonewalling `` any effort to gain pertinent information . '' Levinson 's wife , Christine , said her husband was working as a private investigator on a cigarette smuggling case when he disappeared . `` It 's been extremely difficult for my family , '' she said . `` We hope to resolve this as soon as possible . '' Wexler and Nelson said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective houses calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson . Nelson said Iran could use Levinson 's case as a show of good will toward the incoming Obama administration , which has said it wants to engage Iran after three decades without diplomatic relations . `` We hope that Iran will take this moment in time to show a change in the relationship with the United States by doing this humanitarian gesture for this family , '' he said . In a January 22 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Wexler asked that the case be raised `` at the highest levels . '' Nelson raised Levinson 's status during Clinton 's confirmation hearing . Nelson said the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations has discussed Levinson 's case with him under the `` fiction '' that he represents the people of Florida , not the U.S. government . But he said the Iranians have never acknowledged holding the former federal agent . Levinson had been working as a private investigator in Dubai and was last heard from on March 8 , 2007 . His family said he checked into a hotel on Kish Island and then checked out the next day to go back to the United States , but he never boarded his flight . Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled to Iran to retrace his steps . Christine Levinson also flew to the United Nations in September to ask questions about her husband , whom she says suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure . The family has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return . The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him . State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the U.S. government has called on Iran to provide more information about the matter `` for some time . '' `` His family 's extremely concerned , as you can understand , that no information has been forthcoming , '' Wood said . `` So , again , we call on the Iranians to provide whatever information they have on Mr. Levinson so that we can hopefully return this gentleman to his family .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Vick , recently reinstated to the NFL after being freed from federal prison after a dogfighting-related conviction , has signed a two-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles , according to his agent , Joel Segal . Michael Vick is set to join his new team on Friday , according to his agent . The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback reports to Philadelphia on Friday , Segal told CNN . Details of the deal were not immediately available Thursday night . The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia .

Week 6 of the NFL season is in October . Vick may participate in practices , workouts and meetings and may play in his club 's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement , the league said last month . `` I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege , not a right , and I am truly thankful for -LSB- the -RSB- opportunity I have been given , '' Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement . `` As you can imagine , the last two years have given me time to re-evaluate my life , mature as an individual and fully understand the terrible mistakes I made in the past and what type of life I must lead moving forward , '' he said in last month 's statement . Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy has agreed to continue working with Vick as an adviser and mentor , the NFL said . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters last month that Vick underwent tests , including a psychiatric evaluation , after requests from animal rights groups . Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . At a hearing in that case , he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison . Court documents released in Vick 's case showed that two of his co-defendants , who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal , said Vick helped kill dogs that did n't fight well , and that all three men `` executed approximately eight dogs '' in ways that included hanging and drowning . The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in `` testing '' sessions held at Vick 's property . The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns . Wayne Pacelle , the organization 's president , has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have already been involved . In testimony before the bankruptcy judge , Vick acknowledged committing a `` heinous '' act and said he should have acted more maturely . In November , Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iranian human-rights activist and Nobel laureate has joined the legal team of an Iranian-American journalist convicted of spying and jailed in Iran . Shirin Ebadi , a civil rights leader in Iran , was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 . Shirin Ebadi , who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 , took up the case of Roxana Saberi at the request of Saberi 's family , her father , Reza Saberi , told CNN Wednesday . Ebadi heads the Center for Defenders of Human Rights in Iran . Saberi , 31 , was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public . President Obama , as well as other U.S. and international officials sharply denounced the decision . The Rev. Jesse Jackson has offered to travel to Iran to help seek Saberi 's release . `` If our voices are heard in Iran today , I would be anxious to travel with a delegation to Iran , if we are permitted , and make an appeal for her freedom , '' said the longtime civil rights activist , according to his Rainbow PUSH Coalition . Jackson , 67 , spoke Tuesday at a peace conference in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . `` Whenever we 've brought people out of captivity , whether in Syria , Cuba , Iraq or Yugoslavia , or Liberia , it 's always opened a diplomatic door to reduce tensions , '' he said . Saberi 's attorneys said they will appeal her conviction . Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi ordered the head of Tehran 's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair . Jackson has offered in the past to help release American hostages , most recently in 2005 . At that time , he said he was willing to use his role as a religious leader to help secure the release of Roy Hallums , who was kidnapped along with five others in Baghdad in November 2004 . Hallums was freed in September 2005 when U.S. troops raided the farmhouse where he being held outside Baghdad . In 1984 , Jackson secured the release of a Navy pilot held in Syria . In 1991 , he helped secure the release of 500 `` international guests '' held in Iraq . And in 1999 , he persuaded Yugoslavia to release three U.S. soldiers held there during the Kosovo conflict . Obama has called for Saberi 's release , saying he is `` gravely concerned with her safety and well-being . '' Watch how U.S.-Iranian relations are complicated '' `` We are working to make sure that she is properly treated , and to get more information about the disposition of her case , '' Obama said Sunday . `` She is an American citizen , and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage . '' Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine . The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper credentials . Saberi , who comes from North Dakota , has been living in Iran since 2003 , said the Committee to Protect Journalists , a journalists ' advocacy group . She has freelanced for National Public Radio and other news organizations , and was writing a book about Iranian culture . Iranian authorities revoked her press credentials in 2006 , but Saberi continued to file short news items without permission , the journalists ' group said . Saberi was detained in January , although no formal charges were disclosed . On April 9 , word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage . `` Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter , she was carrying out espionage activities , '' Hassan Haddad , a deputy public prosecutor , told the Iranian Students News Agency . Authorities also said Saberi had confessed . Her father said he thinks she was coerced into making damaging statements . CNN 's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former U.S. government scientist who served in sensitive positions on classified aerospace projects was willing to sell `` some of our most guarded secrets '' a prosecutor alleged Tuesday . Stewart David Nozette of Chevy Chase , Maryland , was taken into custody Monday by FBI agents . Stewart David Nozette , 52 , who is charged with attempted espionage , appeared in U.S. District Court Tuesday afternoon . Authorities said in a criminal complaint that Nozette , of Chevy Chase , Maryland , tried to deliver classified information to someone he thought was an Israeli intelligence official , but who was actually an FBI undercover agent . Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion said Tuesday that evidence will show Nozette disclosed to investigators information that was `` top secret , related to our national defense , that would cause exceptionally grave damage to national security '' if revealed to a foreign country . He said the FBI made videotapes of Nozette indicating he was `` willing to sell some of our most guarded secrets . '' The prosecutor noted that the charges carry a possible life sentence . Nozette answered in the affirmative when Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson asked him whether he understood the seriousness of the charges against him . Other than that , Nozette , who was arrested Monday , made no statements at his initial court appearance . Defense attorney John Kiyonaga did not immediately oppose the government 's request to hold his client without bond , and said his client agreed to waive a deadline for a formal detention hearing . Nozette , who remains in custody , will appear in court again on October 29 for detention and preliminary hearings . In an affidavit , the FBI sets out the case against Nozette , who received a doctorate in planetary sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The FBI document , signed by Special Agent Leslie G. Martell , says that Nozette in January 2009 told a colleague `` that if the United States government tried to put him in jail '' on an unrelated matter , Nozette would move to Israel or another unidentified foreign country and `` tell them everything '' he knows . Nozette had a `` top secret '' clearance , and served at the White House on the National Space Council for President George H.W. Bush , the affidavit says . Later , from early 2000 to early 2006 , he did research and development for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Naval Research Laboratory , and NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , it says . The document says Nozette also acted as a technical consultant from 1998 until early 2008 `` for an aerospace company that was wholly owned by the government of the state of Israel . '' The company consulted with Nozette monthly , getting answers to questions , and he received total payments of $ 225,000 , Martell 's affidavit says . In early September , Nozette was contacted by phone by an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer , but who really was an FBI undercover agent , the document says . They met in downtown Washington in front of a hotel , and over lunch , Nozette `` demonstrated his willingness to work for Israeli intelligence , '' it says . The undercover agent engaged in a series of meetings with Nozette , and eventually Nozette allegedly provided `` secret '' information in a `` dead drop '' post office box . Some of the information , the affidavit says , was classified as secret . The criminal complaint does not accuse the government of Israel of any violations of U.S. law .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton . Almost 30 years later , Etan Patz is still missing . Etan Patz , 6 , disappeared while walking to a school bus stop . It was the first time he 'd gone alone . Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25 , 1979 , the Friday before Memorial Day . He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York . It was the first time he 'd walked to the bus stop by himself . It was just a few blocks away . Etan , like any 6-year-old , argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone , and his parents relented . His mother , Julie Patz , learned that Etan had n't been in classes when he failed to return home . She called the school at 3:30 p.m. , then called the homes of all his friends . When no one had seen Etan , she called police and filed a missing person 's report . By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds . The search continued for weeks , but no clues to Etan 's whereabouts were found . Watch an update on the case '' The boy 's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children 's movement , which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children . Etan 's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s . `` In our minds there were only two possibilities , '' said Stan Patz , the boy 's father . `` Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own , and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe . '' Patz lived with this hope until 1982 , when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos ' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan 's . Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City , a neighborhood not far from Soho . In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge , where he lived , said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois , who spent years investigating the case . When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home , they found he had many photographs of small blond boys . They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz , according to author Lisa R Cohen 's book about the case , `` After Etan : The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive . '' Bronx police questioned Ramos , and he denied having anything to do with Etan 's disappearance . But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy , GraBois said . Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead , but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan 's disappearance , GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office said . Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him , according to published reports . He left town and disappeared for six years -- until GraBois reviewed Etan 's case . GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect . GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison . GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question : `` How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz ? '' Ramos told GraBois that he 'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing . `` He was 90 percent sure it was the same he 'd seen in the news that was missing , '' GraBois said . According to GraBois , Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights . `` Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights , '' GraBois said . When questioned further , Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer , according to GraBois . Ramos is serving a 10 - to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania . He is scheduled to be released in November 2012 , GraBois said . GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison , and planted informants as his cell mates . He would n't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them , but said he 's convinced he 's eyeing the right suspect . GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , but prosecutors have not brought charges . They say that without a body , they do n't have enough evidence . Etan 's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case . Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI\/NYPD Etan Patz hotline : 212-384-2200 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama engaged in a pointed exchange over al Qaeda in Iraq on Wednesday . Sen. John McCain questioned Sen. Barack Obama 's way of handling the war in Iraq . McCain questioned whether Obama was aware of the al Qaeda base . Obama 's response was : `` There was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq . '' McCain was in Tyler , Texas , and Obama was in Columbus , Ohio . `` I understand that Sen. Obama said that if al Qaeda established a base in Iraq that he would send troops back in militarily . Al Qaeda already has a base in Iraq . It 's called al Qaeda in Iraq , '' McCain said . `` It 's a remarkable statement to say that you would send troops back to a place where al Qaeda has established a base -- where they have already established a base . '' McCain 's comments come in response to remarks Obama made Tuesday night in a debate with Sen. Hillary Clinton . He was asked if the president would have the right to go back into Iraq in order to suppress an insurrection after downsizing the U.S. troop presence . Watch what Clinton and Obama said about the war '' `` I always reserve the right for the president ... to make sure that we are looking out for American interests , '' Obama said . `` And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq , then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad . '' A statement by McCain 's press office Wednesday said , `` Is Sen. Obama unaware that al Qaeda is still present in Iraq , that our forces are successfully fighting them every day , and that his Iraq policy of withdrawal would embolden al Qaeda and weaken our security ? '' Obama responded to the latest attacks from McCain , saying his comments were taken out of context . Obama said the question he was asked during the debate was a `` big hypothetical . '' `` I said , ` Well , I would always reserve the right to go in and strike against al Qaeda if they were in Iraq , ' so you know , this is how politics works , '' Obama said at a rally in Columbus . `` McCain thought that he could make a clever point by saying , ` Well let me give you some news Barack , al Qaeda is in Iraq , ' like I was n't reading the papers , like I did n't know what was going on . '' `` I said , ` Well first of all , I do know that al Qaeda is in Iraq . That 's why I 've said we should continue to strike al Qaeda targets . But I have some news for John McCain , and that is that there was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq . '' Obama continued to blast Bush and McCain , saying , `` John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell , but so far all he 's done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq . '' McCain in his statement said `` the Democratic presidential contenders deny progress and see only gloom and doom . Where is the audacity of hope when it comes to backing the success of our troops all the way to victory in Iraq ? What we heard last night was the timidity of despair . '' The latest exchange comes as a new poll suggests McCain would pose a tough match for the eventual Democratic nominee . Obama is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination . Clinton trails by 97 delegates , but 370 delegates are up for grabs next Tuesday . Watch the shift in Clinton-Obama dynamics '' According to a Los Angeles Times\/Bloomberg poll , McCain would be in tight races with either of the remaining Democratic presidential candidates . McCain is statistically tied with Obama , 44 percent to 42 percent , and ahead of Clinton by 6 points , 46 percent to 40 percent . The poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percentage points . The poll also showed McCain with a 61 percent approval rating , a number higher than both Clinton 's and Obama 's in past polls . The Arizona senator holds a clear advantage on dealing with the war in Iraq , according to the poll , and holds a 9 point advantage on economic issues over Obama , despite having acknowledged that area is not his expertise .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four active-duty U.S. soldiers -- three of them elite Army Rangers -- have been arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers . A courtroom sketch shows David White , left , Stefan Champagne , center , and Carlos Lopez . Wearing street clothes , Rangers Carlos Lopez , 30 , and David Ray White , 28 , and Army medic Stefan Andre Champagne , 28 , appeared in federal court Friday . They 're charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy . U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman ordered them held in custody until a preliminary hearing Wednesday . Another Ranger , Randy Spivey , 32 , is scheduled to appear in court Monday . `` It is a sad day when members of one of America 's most elite corps of soldiers , the Army Rangers , are alleged to have become involved in criminal activity , '' U.S. Attorney David E. Nahmias said of the case . `` These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country , not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint . '' Lopez , White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Sandy Springs , Georgia , a suburb just north of Atlanta , by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives who had set up a sting operation . Spivey was apprehended at Camp Frank D. Merrill , an Army Ranger training center in Dahlonega , Georgia , on Friday , the ATF said . Dahlonega is about 60 miles north of Atlanta . Lopez , White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp , where the men are stationed , according to an affidavit filed with U.S. District Court . All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery , the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says . The investigation began in November , when the ATF `` became aware '' that some soldiers were interested in robbing drug dealers of their cocaine , Turner says . He posed as a disaffected security guard for the drug traffickers who wanted to `` rip them off . '' The first try to set up the `` robbery '' failed , but a second attempt earlier this month succeeded , leading to the arrests at the storage facility and , a day later , the Ranger camp . A subsequent search found that Lopez , White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and had an AR-15 assault rifle and a field pouch with 15 magazines of ammunition for it in their vehicle . Agents also found a ski mask , binoculars and a Taser among the items the men brought with them . The four soldiers face minimum mandatory sentences of 10 years in prison each for the drug conspiracy and an additional five years , consecutive , for the weapons allegation . The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 18 hours . They became a permanent presence in the U.S. military in the 1970s . From the Colonial Era until that time , Rangers were activated for specific missions or conflicts and then deactivated when their work was completed . E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama huddled with top military , foreign policy and national security advisers Wednesday as part of an ongoing review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan . President Obama and his national security team meet in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday . The meeting , the fifth such gathering in recent weeks , came as the administration continued to weigh a call for as many as 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan from Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in that country . McChrystal has said the extra manpower is necessary to implement an effective counterinsurgency strategy . Wednesday 's meeting , however , focused on efforts to strengthen the American civilian mission in Afghanistan , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . Obama also received a report on ongoing efforts to train Afghan security forces , Gibbs added . While McChrystal is pushing for a major troop increase , others in the administration are advocating a different approach . Vice President Joe Biden has called for a counterterrorism strategy , which would focus on using special forces and technology to reduce the number of al Qaeda insurgents on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . `` I will tell you that our principal goal remains to root out al Qaeda and its extremist allies that can launch attacks against the United States or its allies , '' Obama said Tuesday . `` That 's our principal mission . We are also obviously interested in stability in the region , and that includes not only Afghanistan but also Pakistan . '' Obama has come under intense pressure from several leading senators to follow McChrystal 's recommendation , a move vehemently opposed by many liberal Democrats . As Obama huddled with his national security team , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Maryland , said he 's not ready yet to support sending additional troops to Afghanistan . Hoyer also told reporters he has serious questions about U.S. chances for success in the region and the stability of the Afghan government . `` Afghanistan has not been a successful venue for many great powers in the past , '' Hoyer said . `` I ca n't think of any . I think we also need to have some degree of confidence that the government in Afghanistan is a viable government that can create confidence within its people . I have reservations about whether that has happened at this point in time . '' The majority leader also argued that the situation in Afghanistan ca n't be viewed in isolation and requires a regional approach that includes Pakistan and India . Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , said Sunday that any added military deployment that fell short of McChrystal 's request `` would be an error of historic proportions . '' `` And I think the great danger now is a half-measure , sort of a -- you know , -LSB- trying -RSB- to please all ends of the political spectrum , '' McCain told CNN 's John King . `` I have great sympathy for the president , making the toughest decisions that presidents have to make , but I think he needs to use deliberate speed , '' he said . Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , argued that U.S. troops would be put in `` jeopardy '' if Obama does not listen to McChrystal . `` I do n't know how you put somebody in who 's as crackerjack as Gen. McChrystal , who gives the president very solid recommendations , and not take those recommendations if you 're not going to pull out , '' she said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . '' Feinstein heads the Senate Intelligence Committee . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Wednesday that he is increasing British troop levels in Afghanistan to 9,500 , an increase of 500 . The British have the second-largest contingent in Afghanistan , after the United States , according to NATO 's International Security Assistance Force . Obama announced a plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March . A total of 65,000 U.S. soldiers are currently serving in the war-torn country .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A major humanitarian crisis is unfolding in northern Sri Lanka with 250,000 unprotected civilians trapped in the crossfire between government troops and rebel forces , the Red Cross says . A civilian , injured during fighting in rebel territory , lies on a bed at a hospital in Vavuniya on January 16 , 2009 . The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- has appealed to both sides to facilitate the movement of civilians out of the combat zone which has seen intensified fighting . `` People are being caught in the crossfire , hospitals and ambulances have been hit by shelling and several aid workers have been injured while evacuating the wounded , '' Jacques de Maio , ICRC head of operations for South Asia in Geneva said in a statement on the ICRC Web site . '' The violence is preventing the ICRC from operating in the region . In the capital , Colombo , Indian foreign affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee huddled Wednesday with Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa on the potential humanitarian crisis . `` The Sri Lankan government has reassured that they would respect the safe zones and minimize the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians , '' Mukherjee said . His discussions with Rajapaksa also envisioned a post-civil war Sri Lanka . `` We will work together with the government of Sri Lanka to enable all Sri Lankans , and particularly the Tamil community who have borne the brunt of the effects of the conflict , to lead normal lives as soon as possible , '' Mukherjee said . But for now , the ICRC says hundreds of patients are in need of emergency treatment and evacuation to Vavuniya Hospital in the government-controlled area and has urged that humanitarian assistance be unhampered in the Vanni region . `` When the dust settles , we may see countless victims and a terrible humanitarian situation , unless civilians are protected and international humanitarian law is respected in all circumstances , '' Maio said . `` It 's high time to take decisive action and stop further bloodshed because time is running out . '' Meanwhile , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has also called for the safety of civilians as humanitarian groups try to provide aid to people trapped in the region . `` The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of civilians caught in intensified fighting in the Vanni region of Sri Lanka , '' a spokesman for Ban said in a statement Monday . Ban called on the government and the separatist Tamil Tigers to respect `` no-fire zones '' and civilians areas , including schools , hospitals and humanitarian posts . He also asked both sides to allow civilians trapped in the fighting to move to `` safe areas . '' Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold in a surprise attack Sunday , even as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians . Watch a report on the recent fighting '' `` It 's an incredibly serious situation , '' James Elder , a U.N. spokesman , said Monday . `` We have a very large number of people , including tens of thousands of children , trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone . '' Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters , according to the government-run news agency . `` Our troops fought their way through a 40 km -LRB- 25 mile -RRB- thick jungle track , '' Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday . `` This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years , '' the Sri Lanka Army chief said . There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken . The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country 's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983 . The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead . The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there , according to the government . In recent days , the military has said it has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds . Earlier this month , troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass , the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula . It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years . The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies . Previously , it was done by air and sea . `` The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally , '' Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India , C.R Jayasinghe , told CNN . `` They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had .

{"answer":"Asheville , North Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama prayed Sunday with the Rev. Billy Graham at Graham 's mountaintop home before leaving North Carolina to attend the memorial service for 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in a recent explosion . Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Graham at his family home , according to Graham spokesman Larry Ross . He is the 12th president , dating back to Harry Truman , to meet with the so-called `` pastor to the presidents . '' `` I am pleased to have had President Obama in my home this afternoon , '' Graham said in a statement , adding that Obama sought the meeting while on vacation in Asheville for the weekend . `` My son Franklin and I enjoyed a brief visit with the president , followed by a time of prayer together . '' During the meeting , Ross said , Obama shared some insights about his faith and the challenges of being commander-in-chief . `` Like others before him , President Obama shared how lonely , demanding and humbling the office of president can be , and how much he appreciated the counsel of people like Mr. Graham and the prayers of so many citizens , '' Ross said . The two men also discussed their love of golf and the city of Chicago , where Graham attended school and held several of his religious crusades , Ross said . At the end , Graham presented Obama with two Bibles -- one for him and the other for first lady Michelle Obama , Ross said . The two men then prayed together , with Obama first praying for Graham and then Graham `` concluded with a prayer for the president , his family and his administration , '' according to Ross . Obama was `` extremely gratified '' that Graham made time for the meeting and private prayer , White House spokesman Bill Burton said . The visit was a follow-up to Obama 's telephone call to Graham on the evangelist 's 91st birthday in November , Burton said . At that time , the two agreed to meet as soon as possible , according to Burton . Ross told CNN the visit came together hastily after the White House officially inquired on Friday , after Obama arrived in North Carolina . Obama and his family vacationed in Asheville over the weekend , and the first couple played tennis Sunday morning before their departure , Burton said . The meeting with Graham came three days after the Army rescinded an invitation for Franklin Graham to speak at the Pentagon on the upcoming National Day of Prayer . The Army decision was because of controversial comments about Islam by the younger Graham . Billy Graham 's statement referred to the upcoming event without mentioning the controversy involving his son . `` As we approach the National Day of Prayer on May 6 , I want to encourage Christians everywhere to pray for our president , and for all those in positions of authority , and especially for the men and women serving in our military , '' Graham said in the statement . In December , Franklin Graham told CNN 's Campbell Brown that `` true Islam '' could not be practiced in America because `` you ca n't beat your wife , you can not murder your children if you think they 've committed adultery or something like that , which they do practice in these other countries . '' Franklin Graham later tried to temper his remarks by saying that he had Muslim friends . Last week , he said he regretted the Army 's decision but stood by his comments . `` I do n't like the way they treat women , the way they treat minorities . I just find it horrific . But I love the people of Islam , '' he said , adding some of his work has been in Muslim nations . The Army , which oversees the National Day of Prayer ceremonies at the Pentagon , feared that if Graham spoke at the Pentagon on May 6 , Islamic militants would publicize his comments , potentially fueling tensions in Muslim nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan , where U.S. troops are deployed . Graham 's invitation was not the only controversy swirling about the National Day of Prayer this year . Last week , a federal judge struck down as unconstitutional the 1952 law that established the day , saying it violated the ban on government-backed religion . On Thursday , the Justice Department informed a federal appeals court that the Obama administration will appeal that decision .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger , accused of sexually assaulting a woman last summer , said Thursday that he is innocent . Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger says there is no merit to the accusation . `` Saturday was the first that I learned of her accusations , '' the Pittsburgh Steeler said , calling the accusation reckless , false and an attack on his family . The woman filed a civil complaint against Roethlisberger last week . `` I would never , ever force myself on a woman , '' he said . The complaint , filed Friday in the 2nd Judicial District Court in Washoe County , Nevada , alleges that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted the woman -- an executive casino host at Harrah 's Lake Tahoe -- while he was staying at the resort for a celebrity golf tournament in July 2008 . Teresa Duffy of the Douglas County , Nevada , Sheriff 's Department , said the department does not intend to open an investigation unless the alleged victim comes forward and tells authorities she wants them to . Roethlisberger said that he would not discuss the `` civil case in the media , '' but that he would fight to protect his family and his reputation . Roethlisberger and eight Harrah 's employees are named in the suit , which seeks at least $ 390,000 , plus unspecified punitive damages , from the defendants . Harrah 's itself is not named as a defendant . The woman said that the employees contributed to her emotional distress and that some defamed her and tried to cover up the incident . According to the complaint , on July 11 , 2008 , the woman was working on the 17th floor -- the same floor as Roethlisberger 's room -- when Roethlisberger told her that his television and sound system were not working . He asked her to try to fix it , the complaint said . When she entered his room and deemed that the television was working , she tried to leave , but Roethlisberger blocked her way , the complaint states . He then , against her will , kissed her , groped her and sexually assaulted her , the complaint states . The woman says that in the months following the incident , she incurred emotional distress that resulted in hospitalizations that included treatment for anxiety and depression , the complaint said . Calvin Dunlap , the woman 's attorney , said earlier this week that his client did not pursue criminal charges after the alleged assault because she felt discouraged when the resort 's chief of security did not investigate the matter . According to the complaint , the chief told her she was `` overreacting . '' Dunlap said the chief has `` close ties to law enforcement . '' Of the eight employees , all but two are still employed by Harrah 's , according to a spokeswoman for Harrah 's Entertainment . Marybel Batjer of Harrah 's declined to comment on the suit , other than to say that the alleged victim still works at Harrah 's Lake Tahoe as an executive casino host . Another Harrah 's Entertainment spokesman , Gary Thompson , said the company was `` confident that a much different story will emerge and that the Harrah 's employees will be dismissed from the lawsuit . '' Roethlisberger 's attorney , David Cornwell , released a statement saying the charges were false . `` The timing of a lawsuit and the absence of a criminal complaint and a criminal investigation are the most compelling evidence of the absence of any criminal conduct , '' he said .

{"answer":"Cleveland , Ohio -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The niece of the mayor of Cleveland , Ohio , once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell , a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home , a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday . Lori Frazier , niece of Mayor Frank Jackson , had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago , said Andrea Taylor , a spokeswoman for Jackson 's office . Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic . `` I just want to know why , why he would do this , '' Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday . `` He took care of me , good care of me . I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house . '' `` I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he did n't kill me , but he killed all these girls , '' she said . Sowell , 50 , is facing five counts of aggravated murder , rape , felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths . All the victims were African-American women . All that remains of one of them is a skull , wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement . Sowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989 . He was released in 2005 . So far , nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell 's home have been identified . The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner 's Office , police said . They are Janice Webb , 49 , and Kim Yvette Smith , who was 43 when last seen . Both women were from Cleveland . Webb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2 , police said . Smith was last seen January 1 , but was not reported missing until November 2 . A grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22 , Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release . The investigation into that incident was what led police , armed with a search warrant , to Sowell 's home , where they discovered the bodies late last month . The alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood , and he took her back to his home , where he became violent and raped her , prosecutors said . `` While raping her , he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness , '' the statement said . `` When she regained consciousness , he led her out of the house . '' Sowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident , along with two counts of rape , two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault , authorities said . Sowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday , authorities said . The charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges , which are second-degree felonies , prosecutors said . If convicted , he would face a sentence of up to life in prison . The investigation into the homicides continues , prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release . `` Upon completion of the investigation , the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor 's Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell . '' Residents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood , but assumed it was from nearby Ray 's Sausage Company . Asked whether she had noticed a foul odor , Frazier told WOIO , `` Yeah , I smelled stuff , but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs . And then I guess after she left , he told me that it was Ray 's Sausage . '' Frazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there . `` I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest , she has my full support , '' Jackson said in a written statement . `` As a family , we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago . My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention , closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal . '' Hundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims . `` It 's hard , because I want to burn it down , '' said Inez Fortson , whose daughter Telacia , 31 and a mother of three children , is among the dead . Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney , according to Sowell 's public defender , Kathleen DeMetz . A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it 's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury , the next expected step . Police recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell 's home to follow up on a rape accusation . In a separate incident , neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor . Firefighters and paramedics responded , and later notified police . But the woman told officers that she was at the home `` partying , '' when she fell off the roof , and no charges were filed . Agents from the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police , Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said . The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police , tracing his life and habits , and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes . `` Our experts tell us it 's likely he 's done this before , '' said Frank Figliuzzi , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Cleveland office . `` He 's probably done it elsewhere , and so we need to determine whether or not he 's responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country . '' In addition , the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad , Figliuzzi said . `` We know , for example , he was a Marine , he was assigned to California , he served in Okinawa , Japan , and we 'll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database , and we 'll specifically be looking at those locations where he 's previously lived . '' Allen Sowell , the suspect 's half-brother , told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago . Their stepmother , who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison , said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time , Allen Sowell said . The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he was n't paying rent , Allen Sowell said . Anthony Sowell said he should n't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father , who died in 2004 . Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007 , his half-brother said . Allen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother 's prison record , but `` just could n't fathom '' the accusations now facing him . `` I did n't think he was in that bad of a mental state , '' Allen Sowell said . `` You never think it would happen to your family . It 's a horrible feeling . '' At 66 , Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother , and the two did n't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9 . He added , `` He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system .

The acclaimed artist painted landscapes and figure subjects and worked mostly in tempera and watercolor . He was widely celebrated inside and outside of the art world . Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 , and President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Wyeth 's paintings at the White House . In 2007 , President Bush awarded Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture . Two years earlier , Wyeth and his wife , Betsy , presented to the White House his painting `` Jupiter , '' which is displayed in the residence 's family sitting room . Bush issued a statement Friday saying that he and first lady Laura Bush `` deeply mourn '' the death of Wyatt . `` Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine , '' Bush said . `` On behalf of the American people , Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seven members of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping patrol have been killed by a heavily armed militia group in Sudan 's Darfur region , the U.N. said . Peacekeepers drive into a Sudanese refugee camp near Farchana , east of Chad . Five of those killed were Rwandan , a U.N. peacekeeping official said , and the other two were a Ugandan and a Ghanaian . Twenty-two others were wounded in the attack , which was immediately condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . `` The attackers used heavy weapons and engaged the UNAMID convoy in an exchange of fire for more than two hours , '' according to the statement released by Ban 's spokesman . UNAMID is the acronym for the U.N.-AU mission in Darfur . The peacekeepers are allowed to used force when fired upon directly . `` The secretary-general condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU-U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice , '' the statement said . `` The secretary-general expresses his deepest condolences to the families of the peacekeepers who lost their lives , and reiterates his appreciation for their service , valor and commitment to the search for peace in Darfur . '' The ambush happened around 2:45 p.m. -LRB- 1145 GMT -RRB- in northern Darfur . The rescue mission did not take place until after dark , she said . The peacekeepers who were attacked operated out of Shangil Tobayi -- a base to the west of El Fasher . In five years of war the U.N. says more than four million people have been affected : Two-and-a-half million people forced from their homes and more than 300,000 killed . Sudanese officials dispute those numbers claiming only 10,000 have died -- a number they say is normal for five years of war . U.S. President George W. Bush calls the killings genocide and has put sanctions on Sudan . The U.N. says Sudan 's government is guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating international human rights laws every bit as heinous and serious they say as genocide . In February 2008 , a fresh wave of killing forced 58,000 people to flee their homes as government troops and Janjaweed militiamen retaliated against rebels . A U.N. report said Sudan broke international law as 115 innocent civilians were killed using tactics similar to those employed in 2003 , 2004 , the worst years of the war . Peacekeepers are frequently targeted by militias in Darfur , where they are trying to protect civilians from `` janjaweed '' militias -- nomadic Arab militias , supported by Sudan 's government , which target pastoral black Africans . Ten African Union peacekeepers were killed in October in an ambush on their peacekeeping base -- the deadliest single attack on AU peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004 . A U.N. commission concluded in 2005 that the Sudanese government and militias `` conducted indiscriminate attacks , including killing of civilians , torture , enforced disappearances , destruction of villages , rape and other forms of sexual violence , pillaging and forced displacement '' in Darfur . In 2006 , the U.N. Security Council authorized the creation of the joint AU\/U . N. hybrid force of peacekeepers to protect civilians in Darfur . That hybrid force formally took over peacekeeping duties late last year from the force composed solely of members of the African Union . Yet the force is under-manned as a result of the Sudanese government 's opposition to a U.N. presence , with just over 9,500 troops of an authorized strength of 26,000 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yemen told outside powers Wednesday to stay out of its battle with a Shiite rebel group in its northwest amid concerns that Iran and Saudi Arabia are being drawn into the conflict . The statement , carried by the state news agency Saba and attributed to a Foreign Ministry source , followed a statement of concern for Yemen 's `` national unity and territorial integrity '' by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Tuesday . `` We welcome what Mottaki affirmed about Iran 's position towards Yemen 's unity and stability , and Yemen reaffirms that it definitely rejects the interference in its internal affairs by any party , '' the statement said . It said Yemen 's battle with the Houthi , a Shiite Muslim rebel movement , is `` an internal Yemeni affair , and Yemen can solve its issues without any interference from others . '' Battles between Yemeni government forces and rebels have raged intermittently for five years , and government troops launched a new offensive in late summer . Saudi Arabia , Yemen 's northern neighbor , turned its air force against suspected Houthi rebels last week after it said the rebels had crossed into Saudi territory . The Houthi claimed that the airstrikes occurred within Yemeni territory , a claim both the Saudi and Yemeni governments denied . The persistent fighting has raised concerns that Yemen -- where U.S. officials say al Qaeda is attempting to establish a new foothold in the region -- could be the stage for a proxy struggle between Shiite-dominated Iran and the Sunni-led Saudi monarchy . Yemen says the conflict is about reasserting government authority and is not a sectarian war . Yemen has accused Iran of supporting the rebels . A Yemeni government official told CNN on Tuesday that Yemen 's navy was `` on the highest state of alert '' after an Iranian boat was captured near Yemeni and Saudi territorial waters last week . In Washington , however , a senior State Department official told CNN that although the U.S. government is concerned about the Yemeni conflict it does not see any sign of an Iranian hand in the Houthi revolt . The State Department has been in touch with the Yemenis and Saudis about the need to reduce tensions but is yet to be convinced that Iran is involved in Yemen , the official said . The United Nations has expressed alarm over the fighting and said there has been a `` significant increase '' in the number of people displaced in recent weeks . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates as many as 175,000 people have been affected by the conflict since 2004 , U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Tuesday .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somali government forces have seized control of a central town from an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia , a spokesman for Somalia 's president said Thursday . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has offered aid to Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , Somalia 's president . `` Bulo Burde is now under the control of government forces after our forces overran a stiff resistance at the entrance bridge of the town by Al Shabaab fighters , '' said Abdulkadir Mohamed Osman , communication director for Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , Somalia 's transitional president . Despite the announcement , residents said heavy fighting continued Thursday and the town is still divided between pro-government forces and Al Shabaab fighters . The ongoing exchange of heavy-weapon fire between the two sides has trapped people in the town , residents said . `` Everyone inside this house is scared because heavy shells are raining in the town , '' said one resident , Sahra Muse . Bulo Burde is about 155 miles -LRB- 250 kilometers -RRB- southeast of the Somali capital of Mogadishu . The United States is supporting the Somali government 's fight against the insurgents , including providing weapons to government forces . Al Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network . The United States is concerned that Somalia 's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency , as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power later that year . Earlier this month , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Somalia 's transitional president and vowed to continue U.S. support for his government . `` The United States and the international community must serve as an active partner in helping the TFG -LSB- transitional federal government -RSB- and the people of Somalia confront and ultimately move beyond the conflict and poverty that have gripped their country , '' Clinton said at a joint news conference with Ahmed at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi , Kenya . The United States announced in June that it is providing weapons and ammunition to help Ahmed 's government fight the militants . The weapons shipments are in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions , which ban some arms shipments to Somalia , said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly . Clinton warned that terrorist groups like Al Shabaab pose a threat to the broader international community . `` Certainly if Al Shabaab were to obtain a haven in Somalia , which could then attract al Qaeda and other terrorist actors , it would be a threat to the United States , '' she said . There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan . CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives . `` Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa , like Somalia and Yemen , that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there , '' Panetta said in June . Separately , the FBI is investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by Al Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States . More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis , Minnesota , area in recent months . At least three of them , including a suicide bomber , have been killed in Somalia . Also , Australia recently announced the arrests of four men with ties to Al Shabaab who were suspected of planning a suicide attack on a military base in the southern state of Victoria . President Ahmed is a former member of the Islamic Courts Union , which took part in the 2006 coup . His decision to renounce the bloody insurgency and try to establish peace in Somalia has put him at odds with Islamist hard-liners who are still battling for control of Somalia . It also paved the way for his election as president of Somalia 's U.N.-backed transitional government in January . Journalist Mohammed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"SAN FRANCISCO , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Steroid test results and notes and calendars from his then-trainer are among the evidence federal prosecutors have amassed in their perjury case against baseball home-run king Barry Bonds , according to documents unsealed Wednesday . Barry Bonds , shown at his most recent court appearance , is accused of lying to a grand jury . The 223-page stack of documents unsealed by a federal judge represents much of the government 's case against Bonds , who is accused of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury investigating the use of steroids in professional sports . Prosecutors say the test results show Bonds was using performance-enhancing substances -- including a then-undetectable designer drug -- at a time he denied knowingly using any . Bonds ' attorneys are seeking to keep much of that evidence out of court . The 44-year-old former San Francisco Giants slugger holds Major League Baseball 's single-season and all-time home-run titles , but his achievements have been shadowed by allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs . Bonds pleaded not guilty to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges and has been free on $ 500,000 bond . A hearing in the case is scheduled for Thursday . The charges stem from his 2003 appearance before a federal grand jury probing the distribution of steroids by the San Francisco-area Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative , or BALCO . Bonds told the grand jury that his former personal trainer , Greg Anderson , gave him a cream that he said was flaxseed oil to use on his arm in 2003 . Anderson spent three months in prison after admitting distributing steroids and was later jailed for refusing to cooperate with prosecutors . The case against Bonds will include calendars kept by Anderson that prosecutors say were used to keep Bonds and other athletes on a doping regimen -- an assertion expected to be bolstered by the testimony of other athletes , they said . Evidence will include a recording of a phone conversation with an associate in which Anderson `` describes injecting the defendant , having the ability to obtain and utilize inside information about MLB 's random drug testing to the defendant 's benefit and the undetectable nature of what Anderson had been doing , '' according to documents . Bonds won seven National League MVP titles during his 22-year career , 15 years of which was spent with the Giants . The team released him after the 2007 season , just weeks after he broke Hank Aaron 's career home-run record .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The failure of General Electric engines on four jet aircraft overseas during the past two years has prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to issue an `` urgent '' recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft . None of the incidents resulted in crashes , injuries or fatalities . But in all four cases , engine parts penetrated the engine housing . Such `` uncontained engine failures '' are particularly dangerous because flying engine parts could puncture fuel or hydraulic lines , damage flight surfaces or even penetrate the fuselage and injure passengers . At issue are General Electric CF6-45 \/ 50 series jet engines , older engines found on a small number of jets . FAA officials said 373 of the engines are in service in the United States , on a fewer , but unknown , number of planes . The engines are used on some Airbus A300s , Boeing 747s , DC-10s , MD-10s and U.S. Air Force KC-10s . A GE spokeswoman said most of the engines are used on cargo planes . On four occasions , the NTSB said , a rotor imbalance caused rotor disks to fail , leading to the uncontained engine failures . FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the FAA is aware of the problem and issued a rule in March requiring inspections of the engines within 50 flights , and repeat inspections every 175 flights thereafter . It also is working on a rule that would add testing of the rotor disks for cracks . But on Thursday , the NTSB issued its urgent recommendation , saying the FAA should require inspections every 15 flights until the disks can be replaced with improved parts . The FAA said the action `` will maintain the safety of the fleet , '' and that it will decide whether to alter the inspection schedule after completing examinations of the engines involved in the recent incidents . GE spokeswoman Deborah Case said GE issued a service bulletin last August advising operators to inspect and monitor the engines . The NTSB recommendation follows these four incidents : -- July 4 , 2008 : A Saudi Arabian Airlines -LRB- Saudia -RRB- Boeing 747-300 experienced an engine failure after takeoff from Jeddah , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . -- March 26 , 2009 : An Arrow Cargo McDonnell Douglas DC-10F , about 30 minutes after takeoff from Manaus , Brazil , experienced loss of oil pressure in one engine . The pilots shut down the engine and diverted to Medellin , Colombia . -- December 17 , 2009 : A Jett8 Airlines Cargo Boeing 747-200F was passing through 7,000 feet when the crew members heard a muffled explosion . With one engine losing oil pressure , the airplane returned to land at Changi , Singapore . -- April 10 , 2010 : An ACT Cargo Airbus A300B4 experienced an engine failure while accelerating for takeoff at Manama , Bahrain . The crew declared an emergency , aborted the takeoff , activated the fire-suppression system , and evacuated the airplane . The NTSB is participating in or leading investigations of the four incidents .","question":""}
{"answer":"Beijing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China summoned the U.S. ambassador on Friday to express its `` strong dissatisfaction '' over the Dalai Lama 's meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama a day earlier . China did n't disclose what was discussed during the session with Ambassador Jon Huntsman at the Foreign Ministry . But Beijing had warned that a meeting between the president and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader would damage its ties with Washington . `` The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this meeting , '' a spokesman for China 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement after Thursday 's meeting at the White House . `` China demands the U.S. seriously consider China 's stance , immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact , -LSB- and -RSB- stop conniving and supporting anti-China separatist forces . '' The U.S. Embassy did n't characterize Friday 's meeting , but it provided the message Huntsman delivered to Deputy Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai . `` Now is the time to move forward and cooperate in ways that benefit our two counties , the region and the world , '' Huntsman said , according to the U.S. Embassy . The meeting has the potential to further complicate Sino-U.S. tensions , which have been rising in recent months . The Dalai Lama has said he favors genuine autonomy for Tibetans , not independence for Tibet . Beijing regards the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as a separatist who wishes to sever Tibet from China . Obama 's meeting with the Dalai Lama `` runs against the repeated commitments by the U.S. government that the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and gives no support to ` Tibet independence ' , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said . During the meeting , Obama stressed his `` strong support for the preservation of Tibet 's unique religious , cultural and linguistic identity , and the protection of human rights for Tibetans , '' according to a White House statement . The president praised the Dalai Lama 's `` commitment to nonviolence and his pursuit of dialogue with the Chinese government , '' the statement added . He also stressed the importance of having both sides `` engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences , and was pleased to hear about the recent resumption of talks , '' it noted . The Dalai Lama , while acknowledging that he raised concerns about Tibet during the meeting , did not provide further specifics about his home region 's political situation while addressing reporters . He said he admired America as a `` champion of democracy and ... freedom , '' and cited the need to promote `` religious harmony '' and `` human value . '' He also met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . The meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama could `` seriously undermine the Sino-U.S. political relations , '' Zhu Weiqun , a senior Communist Party leader in charge of ethnic and religious affairs , warned recently . `` We will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes . '' On Thursday , China 's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the meeting `` grossly violated the norms governing ... international relations . '' Obama did not meet with the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader visited Washington last fall , making it the first time since 1991 that such a meeting did not occur . Ahead of a summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao , Obama persuaded Tibetan representatives back then to postpone the meeting with the Dalai Lama . Thursday 's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between America and China , including trade disputes , a recent U.S. arm sales deal for Taiwan -- which China considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship row over Internet search engine Google Inc. . The meeting is `` another event in the recent , one has to say , downward spiral in U.S.-China relations , '' said China scholar David Shambaugh . It 's also troublesome for the Chinese for one other important reason , Shambaugh said . `` He could have met him as a spiritual leader in a neutral place like a church , '' he said . But receiving him in the White House `` is a political act . And that is going to irritate China very much . '' The meeting did not take place in the formal , official setting of the Oval Office . It was instead held in the White House Map Room , which is considered part of the presidential residence . The choice of settings was considered by many observers to be a sign of Washington 's acknowledgment of Beijing 's political sensitivities . Some analysts said the Chinese government could retaliate by cutting off political exchanges as they did after the Dalai Lama met with the heads of state of France and Germany . And Hu could turn down an invitation to visit Washington in April . Neither China nor the United States can afford strained relations , said Douglas Paal , a diplomat and investment banker who has served as a presidential adviser on China . `` We both need each other , '' he said . `` We need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis , to deal with the global financial crisis . '' China is the largest growing export market for U.S. companies , Paal said , expanding by 65 percent last year alone . Nearly three-quarters of all Americans think that Tibet should be an independent country , according to a new national CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll . But the survey , released Thursday , also indicates that most Americans think it is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take a stand on Tibet .

{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A mother and her teenage son are kidnapped . The kidnappers place a cell phone in the car of the boy 's father so they can communicate their ransom demands . The son is burned with a blowtorch . The mother implores the father to pay the ransom . A terrifying scenario , but one that the FBI and police say was all orchestrated by the mother to get some fast cash from her ex-husband . The mother , Alejandra Arriaza , her boyfriend , Angel Ponce , and his nephew , Joel Boza , were charged Tuesday with federal kidnapping counts . If convicted , they could be sentenced to life in prison . According to an FBI affidavit , all three have admitted their roles in the phony kidnapping . `` We took it very seriously and believed a couple of lives were at risk , '' said Jim Leljedal of the Broward County , Florida , sheriff 's office . `` And then to find out that one of the victims was involved in the plot was pretty surprising . '' The three suspects will have a detention hearing Wednesday in a federal court in Miami , Florida . The U.S. attorney 's office would not comment on the case . According to the FBI affidavit , written by special agent Scott Wilson , the plot was Arriaza 's idea . It began , court papers say , when she and her boyfriend found out her ex-husband had recently come into some money from the sale of a business , and that he kept a large amount of cash in his home . The father and son are not named in the affidavit , which refers to the father as `` H.P. '' and to his 17-year-old son as `` N.P. '' The affidavit says that the plot began Thursday when Arriaza told her son she wanted to take him to Wal-Mart to purchase an Apple iPhone . When they got back to their car , a masked intruder appeared from the back seat , pointed a gun at the son 's back and told him and his mother that they were being kidnapped , according to the affidavit . The kidnapper placed thick tape over the son 's eyes and instructed his mother to drive to a mobile home in southwest Miami , where a second person , who introduced himself as `` El Negro , '' was waiting . The affidavit says the men forced N.P. to sit in a chair , where they bound his hands . His torso was bound to the back of the chair with shrink wrap , and his legs were bound with tape . The boy 's head was wrapped in thick tape from the top to the tip of his nose , and he was put in a closet , where he spent the night . The next day , according to the FBI affidavit , the kidnappers called the boy 's father on a cell phone they had placed in his car . The father then called authorities , who began to record the phone calls . At one point during the abduction , the son told the kidnappers that his father had about $ 50,000 in a bank , the affidavit says . When the kidnappers felt that the father was not complying with their demands , they threatened to burn his son , and at one point , according to the affidavit , `` the kidnappers put a lit blowtorch close to the phone , so he could hear it . '' During another phone call , Arriaza , who is the father 's ex-wife , told him that kidnappers were burning their son 's feet . She implored him to pay the kidnappers their ransom , the affidavit says . At one point , Wilson wrote , the kidnappers held the blowtorch so close to N.P. `` that it burnt the hair off his leg . '' `` I think they wanted to impress him with the seriousness so that he would relay ... to his father to come up with some money , '' Leljedal said . Under the FBI 's guidance , the father arranged to pay the ransom . But late in the evening of April 10 , before the ransom was paid , law enforcement located the mobile home and rescued the son , who immediately identified his mother 's boyfriend , Angel Ponce , as one of the men inside the unit where he was being held . A search of the home turned up a fake gun , a blowtorch , tape and three cell phones . According to the affidavit , Ponce said Arriaza came up with the idea to have herself kidnapped , along with her son , to get money from her ex-husband . Arriaza later admitted her involvement in the kidnapping and said her son had no involvement in the ruse , according to the FBI . `` We do n't think she meant to harm to her son . She just wanted to collect from her ex , '' Leljedal said . In the end , he said , it was all about one thing : `` The basic motive of greed . ''","question":""}

A member of the Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007 . The U.N. 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- OCHA -RRB- reported that fighting in Muhajeria and Shearia between Sudanese government forces , and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- , drove over 15,000 people north to the Zam Zam camp . The water supply to the camp is becoming strained with displaced people arriving there every day , OCHA said Wednesday . The government of Sudan has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years , a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide . An estimated 300,000 people in the western Sudanese region have been killed through combat , disease or malnutrition , according to the United Nations . An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels , government forces and the violent Janjaweed militias . Fighting continues in the region despite the JEM and local government signing a `` goodwill and confidence-building '' agreement earlier in February , according to the U.N. . The U.N.-African Union allied peacekeeping mission -LRB- UNAMID -RRB- will begin building a new community police center near Zam Zam in the next two weeks , the U.N. announced Saturday . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government . To counter the rebels , Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the United Nations , Western governments and human rights organizations . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength . Last year , Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government 's campaign of violence in Darfur . Under pressure to end the fighting , Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur . But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement was not included in the case-fire talks . CNN 's Katy Byron contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Predatory mice are threatening the albatross population on a remote south Atlantic island and have caused the birds ' worst nesting season on record , a British bird charity says . Baby albatross on a remote Atlantic island are threatened by killer house mice . The research from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds indicates bad news for the Tristan albatross , whose only home is Gough Island in the middle of the south Atlantic . House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction , the RSPB said . The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting , one of the world 's largest finches , the RSPB said . `` Without removal of the mice , both the albatross and the bunting that live there are doomed to extinction , '' Grahame Madge , a conservation spokesman for the RSPB , told CNN . The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage , the RSPB said . This makes it especially difficult for the albatross population to survive because the birds lay eggs only once every two years -- a very low reproductive rate compared to other birds , Madge said . `` What -LSB- the mice -RSB- are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population , '' he said . Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea , a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish . The albatrosses are attracted to the bait and while some manage to steal it successfully , many more get snagged and drown , Madge said . Because of the impact from house mice , introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries , conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction . Gough Island , a British territory almost midway between Argentina and South Africa , is a place of stunning natural beauty . The island is not inhabited by humans . Gough Island and nearby Inaccessible Island are both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites . A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs , the RSPB said . A later survey revealed only 246 chicks had survived to fledgling . `` We 've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers , '' said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert , who recently visited the island to assess the problem . `` However , we now know that the albatrosses have suffered their worst year on record . '' The bunting suffer because the mice eat their eggs and chicks , and may also compete with them for food in the winter , Cuthbert said . `` The decline in bunting numbers is alarming , '' said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town , who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s . `` Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice , both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time . '' The RSPB has been studying whether it is possible to remove the mice . It said trials so far look promising , but it urged the British government to step up funding for the project . It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species . The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters . Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world . Albatrosses principally live in the southern Atlantic but some also live in the Pacific , the RSPB says .

{"answer":"BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations Sunday launched a special tribunal to prosecute the assassins of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . A statue of slain former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri stands in Beirut . The tribunal convened at The Hague more than four years after Hariri was killed in a massive car bombing in Beirut on February 14 , 2005 . The bomb , detonated as Hariri 's armored motorcade passed through Beirut 's fashionable seaside Corniche district , contained hundreds of pounds of explosives . It left buildings shattered and streets littered with the mangled wreckage of vehicles . The blast also killed 22 other people . The Lebanese army was out in force on the streets of Beirut Sunday as people turned out to pay their respects to Hariri , who is buried downtown in the Lebanese capital . The U.N. tribunal will have 11 judges , whose identities are being kept secret for their safety . Four will be Lebanese . The prosecution could take as long as 10 years , sources close to the tribunal said . Four senior Lebanese generals are being held over the bombing , which also killed 22 other people . But many Lebanese -- as well as the United States and U.N. investigators -- believe Syria ordered the assassination . Syria denies it . The tribunal 's prosecutor , Daniel Bellemare , refused to commit when asked at a news conference Sunday if Syrians would be charged . He said the public would have to wait and see . The U.S. State Department pledged its continued support of Lebanese judicial authorities and the tribunal 's operations . The United States has promised to contribute $ 14 million ; a request for an additional $ 6 million is pending approval from Congress . In a statement issued Sunday , acting State Department spokesman Robert A. Wood said Hariri 's death `` was an unsuccessful attempt to undermine Lebanon 's sovereignty . '' He added : `` The Lebanese people answered his assassination with the Cedar Revolution , leading to the withdrawal of Syrian troops and the most democratic Lebanese elections in decades . '' At the time of Hariri 's death , neighboring Syria had immense political influence in the country , and had maintained troops in its smaller neighbor since the 1980s , after the fighting between Israel and the PLO in Lebanon . Hariri was admired for spearheading the rebuilding of Beirut after the country 's civil war , from 1975 to 1990 , and many Lebanese blamed Syria for the killing , citing Hariri 's patriotism and strong sense of Lebanese independence . The killing sparked widespread protests that led to the eventual withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the election of an anti-Syrian bloc in parliament . The anti-Syrian movement is known as the March 14 Alliance , named after the day millions of supporters of Hariri took to the streets , and its actions have been dubbed the Cedar Revolution , for the nation 's iconic cedar trees . Huge counter-protests also were staged by Lebanese supporters of Syria . Along the way , U.N. investigators tasked to probe the attack found links between Syria 's government and Hariri 's assassination . The Lebanese hope the tribunal will settle the case , but there are also fears it could further divide the nation and open up older wounds in the country . The special tribunal takes over from the Beirut-based International Independent Investigation Commission , which looked into 20 other attacks and found elements linking some of them to a criminal network behind the Hariri killing , the United Nations said . The trial will take place in a converted gymnasium in a suburb of The Hague . The U.N. says the case is expected to be ready for trial by 2010 . -- CNN 's Cal Perry contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death of actress Natasha Richardson , who sustained a fatal head injury while skiing , has reignited the perennial debate around the safety of the sport . Head injuries are the most common cause of death among skiers The 45 year-old died Wednesday , two days after falling on a beginners slope while having a private lesson at Canada 's Mont Tremblant resort . While full details of the circumstances surrounding Richardson 's death are not yet known , head injuries are the most common cause of fatalities among skiers worldwide . `` A typical death is a high speed collision with a static object after losing control -- a tree or a person , '' Dr Mike Langran a GP who works in Aviemore , Scotland and runs Ski-injury . com told CNN . `` Most ski deaths involve multi-trauma , but a head injury is by far the most common reason . `` There might be injuries to the abdomen or the chest or the neck but there nearly always is a head trauma as well . '' However , Langran , along with many other industry experts , maintains that skiing is a relatively safe sport . `` I do n't regard skiing and snowboarding as a dangerous sport , '' he said . `` It 's like many activities in life -- there are people who do silly things but in general these sports are safe . '' There are an estimated 200 million skiers in the world , and in the U.S. -LRB- one of the few countries to keep reliable data on skiers and ski injuries -RRB- an estimated 55 million people ski . Each year there are 39 deaths , which equates to about 2 deaths per million skiers . While children and beginners are most at risk of being injured while skiing , it 's those more experienced on the slopes who are most likely to be involved in a fatal accident . `` When you look at fatalities it does tend to be younger males and often of better skiing ability who are maybe pushing limits a little bit harder , traveling a little bit faster , '' Langran said . In Austria , earlier this year a huge debate over the safety of skiing was sparked by a high-profile incident on the slopes , which involved a German politician . Deiter Althaus , minister-president of Thuringia state was charged with manslaughter after colliding with another skier , Beata Christandl , a 41 year-old Slovakian mother of four , who later died from multiple head injuries . He was accused by Austrian prosecutors of entering onto a slope against the direction of traffic while skiing at high speed . Althaus was left with a fractured skull and has no recollection of the accident . Althaus ' accident may be typical of the kind that cause deaths in skiers but , The Austria Ski Federation says Althaus ' case is very unusual . Each year , an estimated 10 million people ski in Austria 's resorts and there are between 10 and 50 deaths during this time , according to Thomas Woldrich , Head of Leisure Skiing at the federation . `` There 's a minimal risk to get hurt when skiing , '' Woldrich told CNN . `` When you 're skiing approximately 14 days a year , the risk of having an injury is one in 55 years . '' Even so , a law was recently passed in Austria making it compulsory for children to wear helmets on Austrian ski slopes . `` We do have an extraordinary trend towards wearing helmets , '' said Woldrich . `` We have , especially among children , almost 100 percent of skiers wearing helmets on Austrian ski slopes . '' Whether or not skiers should be forced by law to wear helmets is a debate that continues energetically in many countries . The big question is do they make skiers safer . Langran says that while there is evidence to suggest that helmets will provide a moderate degree of protection for low speed impacts , there is no evidence for high speed collisions . `` As far as I 'm aware there is no evidence that for high speed impacts -- you 're talking about 30 mph plus impacts , which sounds a lot but that 's the average speed of a good intermediate skier on the slopes -- there 's no evidence that if you hit a tree at that kind of speed a helmet will protect you against a fatality . '' Indeed , there is evidence that wearing a helmet can give some skiers a feeling of invincibility , which can make them ski faster and more recklessly . So , what can skiers do to make themselves safer ? It 's all about knowing the risks and making informed choices , according to Sean Langmuir , a trained ski instructor who has coached both the Canadian National Ski Team and the British National Ski Team . `` People need to be better informed but they need to seek out that information for themselves , '' said Langmuir who is also Training Manager for British Association of Snowsport Instructors -LRB- BASI -RRB- . `` A lot of people go on ski holidays and they ca n't ski very well and they wo n't go for a lesson immediately . It can help so much to get all that basic information . '' It is also important to have properly fitting equipment , according to Langmuir . `` It 's not just a helmet , it can be the skis or the snowboard that you use can make a big difference to how you manage to control yourself . It 's quite important to gain information from professionals before you go out about what equipment you will need . '' Skiers can also refer to the the International Ski Federation -LRB- FIS -RRB- Rules of Conduct as a guide for safety on the slopes . `` The single most important piece of advice is to ski or snowboard within limits of your ability , '' Langran told CNN . `` Do n't go faster than you are able to and do n't try slopes you should n't . '' FIS Rules of Conduct 1 . Respect for others A skier or snowboarder must behave in such a way that does not endanger or prejudice others . 2 . Control of speed and skiing or snowboarding A skier or snowboarder must move in control -- adapt speed and manner of skiing or snowboarding to personal ability and to the prevailing conditions of terrain , snow and weather as well as to the density of traffic . 3 . Choice of route A skier or snowboarder coming from behind must choose a route in such a way to not endanger skiers or snowboarders ahead . 4 . Overtaking A skier or snowboarder may overtake another skier or snowboarder above or below and to the right or to the left provided enough space is available for the overtaken skier or snowboarder to make any voluntary or involuntary movement . 5 . Entering , starting and moving upwards A skier or snowboarder entering a marked run , starting again after stopping or moving upwards on the slopes must look up and down the slopes to ensure no one is put at risk . 6 . Stopping on the piste Unless absolutely necessary , a skier or snowboarder must avoid stopping on the piste in narrow places or where visibility is restricted . After a fall in such a place , a skier or snowboarder must move clear of the piste as soon as possible . 7 . Climbing and descending on foot A skier or snowboarder either climbing or descending on foot must keep to the side of the piste . 8 . Respect for signs and markings A skier or snowboarder must respect all signs and markings . 9 . Assistance At accidents , every skier or snowboarder is duty bound to assist . 10 . Identification Every skier or snowboarder and witness , whether a responsible party or not , must exchange names and addresses following an accident .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspected killer of a 20-year-old pregnant Camp Lejeune Marine is in a North Carolina jail late Friday after being extradited from Mexico , law enforcement sources said . Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , 22 , was extradited Friday to the United States and held on a murder charge . Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , 22 , was arrested in Mexico in April 2008 . He has been indicted on charges that include financial card transaction fraud , obtaining property by false pretenses and first-degree murder in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach . Laurean , who is being held without bond , was booked into the Onslow County Detention Center about 9 p.m. ET , according to a police statement obtained by CNN . An arraignment is scheduled for Monday , the statement read . Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she disappeared in December 2007 ; her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean 's backyard near Camp Lejeune in North Carolina , where both were stationed , in January 2008 . Investigators accompanied Laurean , who fled to Mexico , back to the United States on Friday morning , two law enforcement sources said . Laurean will stand trial in Onslow County , North Carolina , for Lauterbach 's killing . North Carolina prosecutors allege Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico . He was arrested in San Juan Vina in the Mexican state of Michoacan . Because he holds dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico , he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process , authorities have said . Before Laurean 's extradition to the United States , Camp Lejeune spokesman Maj. Cliff Gilmore said the slaying suspect would go into the civilian jail in Onslow County and stand trial in a civilian court . He was listed as a deserter shortly after he disappeared following Lauterbach 's death . He remains on deserter status , but is still considered an active-duty Marine , Gilmore said . '' -LSB- Laurean -RSB- will be treated like any other inmate in our detention center , and he will be prosecuted by the district attorney 's office , '' Rick Sutherland , inspector general of the Onslow County Sheriff 's Office , said in a written statement . The FBI said in a news release Thursday the sheriff 's office asked for help in finding Laurean after he disappeared January 12 , 2008 . If convicted , Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole . Mexico 's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over . Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach , Laurean replied , `` I loved her . '' Authorities found Lauterbach 's body after Laurean 's wife , Christina , produced a note her husband had written claiming the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument , according to officials . Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach 's neck , autopsy results indicated that the wound would not have been fatal and may have occurred after death . Lauterbach died from blunt-force trauma to the head , according to the autopsy . Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach 's slaying before she gave the note to authorities . As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean , authorities had seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Christina Laurean was using to communicate with her husband , a law enforcement official had told CNN . Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her , and it is unclear whether he was the father of her unborn child . Her relatives have said they believe he was . Laurean had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with Lauterbach . Mary Lauterbach , the slain woman 's mother , has said she 's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter 's rape allegation and other allegations of harassment seriously . Relatives said that Lauterbach 's car was keyed and that an anonymous person had punched her in the face . `` Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them , '' she has said . In a statement issued after Lauterbach 's death , the Marine Corps said Laurean 's denial of the rape allegation `` was believed to be significant evidence . '' CNN 's Rich Phillips , Carol Cratty and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British man Gary McKinnon appeared in court Tuesday to try to prevent his extradition to the United States , where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into U.S. government computers at the Pentagon and NASA . Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation . McKinnon , who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems , wants to be tried in Britain rather than the United States . He is asking judges at the High Court to review a decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in Britain , a spokeswoman at the prosecutor 's office told CNN . The prosecutor 's decision effectively cleared the way for McKinnon 's extradition , and McKinnon is hoping it will be overturned . It is not clear when the judges will make a decision on McKinnon 's request . Prosecutors made their decision in February despite saying there was sufficient evidence to prosecute McKinnon . But they said their evidence did not reflect the level of criminality alleged by U.S. authorities , so they would allow him to be tried in America . The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time , accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001 and costing the government about $ 1 million . McKinnon , currently free on bail in England , has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs . Prosecutors in the United States and Britain disagree . `` These were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach U.S. defense systems at a critical time which caused well-documented damage , '' Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said in February . `` They may have been conducted from Mr. McKinnon 's home computer -- and in that sense there is a UK link -- but the target and the damage were trans-Atlantic . '' U.S. federal prosecutors accuse McKinnon of breaking into military , NASA and civilian networks and accessing computers at the Pentagon ; Fort Benning , Georgia ; Fort Meade , Maryland ; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck , New Jersey ; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas , among others . In one case , McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington . McKinnon is believed to have acted alone , with no known connection to any terrorist organization , said Paul McNulty , the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia . A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity . If convicted , he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $ 250,000 fine . McKinnon 's lawyer , Karen Todner , has complained that the United States has never provided evidence to prosecutors or McKinnon 's legal team to support their extradition request -- and in fact , under Britain 's Extradition Act of 2003 , U.S. prosecutors are not required to . McKinnon has previously said it was easy for him to access the secret files . `` I did occasionally leave messages in system administrators ' machines saying , ` This is ridiculous , ' '' McKinnon has said . '' -LRB- I left -RRB- some political diatribes as well , but also a pointer to say , you know , this is ridiculous . '' McKinnon was on the brink of extradition in August 2008 , when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , France , refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the United States , effectively clearing the way for his transfer . Shortly after that decision , however , McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome , and he claims that diagnosis changed the case for extradition . It was on that basis that McKinnon made his appeals in Britain . Asperger syndrome is a form of autism that affects a person 's social communication and interaction , according to Britain 's National Autistic Society . Those affected often are of above-average intelligence and have fewer problems speaking than do those with autism . They sometimes have difficulty knowing when to start or end a conversation and can be very literal in what they say , with difficulty understanding jokes , metaphors and sarcasm . In addition , some people with Asperger syndrome develop an intense , sometimes obsessive interest in a hobby or subject , the National Autistic Society said . `` He says what he thinks to his own detriment , '' a friend of McKinnon 's told CNN in January . He said McKinnon fears that his compulsion to say what he thinks would land him in trouble in an American prison .","question":""}

The deal 's Comprehensive Peace Agreement ended a north-south civil war that killed about 2 million people and displaced more than 4 million others . An impasse over the boundaries of the town of Abyei is a major reason the peace agreement has not been fully implemented . Fighting erupted in Abyei on May 13 . It resumed Tuesday despite a cease-fire and has `` resulted in the destruction '' of the town `` and the displacement of between 30,000 and 50,000 people , '' the secretary general said in a statement .

The civil war in Sudan , which started in 1983 , pitted a northern government dominated by Arab Muslims against black Christians and animists in southern Sudan . That conflict was not directly related to ongoing violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan . Human rights groups and United Nations say the Sudanese military armed and trained Arab militias in Darfur after a rebellion erupted in 2003 . They say the military and militias have engaged in widespread killing , rape and forced displacements in Darfur as they battle about rebels who have splintered into roughly a dozen groups . One of those groups staged a daring attack this month near the Sudanese capital , Khartoum . The government said it quashed the attack .

{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. and Pakistani troops exchanged fire Thursday along the Pakistani-Afghan border minutes after the Pakistani military fired shots at two American helicopters that were providing cover for the troops , a U.S. military spokesman said . Pakistan says it shot at two U.S. OH-58D helicopters like this one pictured in a U.S. Army photo . The U.S. Army OH-58D Kiowas , part of NATO 's International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan , were patrolling the Pakistani-Afghan border when the Pakistani military fired on them , NATO and U.S. officials said . The Pakistani military said the fire was warning shots , and President Asif Ali Zardari said it was flares . Both Zardari and the Pakistani military said the helicopters had crossed into Pakistani territory -- a charge U.S. officials denied . Rear Adm. Greg Smith of U.S. Central Command said the helicopters were providing cover for a small U.S. military unit accompanying an Afghan border police unit on a routine patrol . After the shots were fired at the helicopters , Smith told CNN , the U.S. troops fired `` suppressing rounds '' into a nearby hill to get the Pakistanis to stop . That prompted the Pakistani troops to stop firing at the helicopters and fire instead in the direction of the troops , he said . The U.S. troops then returned fire , Smith said . No injuries were reported in the five-minute incident . Smith and other U.S. officials said the helicopter crews did not fire back . But the Pakistanis disagreed , asserting in a written statement that the helicopters `` returned fire '' after the initial shots were fired . `` The helicopters passed over our border post and were well within Pakistan territory '' at the time that `` security forces fired anticipatory warning shots , '' the Pakistani statement said . After the shots were fired , `` the helicopters returned fire and flew back . '' The Pakistani statement did not mention exchanging fire with ground troops and did not identify the shots as flares , as Zardari did in New York in an appearance with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . `` They are flares , '' he said in response to a question asking why the Pakistani military was firing on NATO helicopters . `` Just to make sure that they know they crossed the border line . '' Asked if such warnings will continue , he replied , `` Sometimes the border is so mixed that they do n't realize that they crossed the border . '' Rice , off camera , agreed that `` the border is very unclear '' and `` inhospitable . '' Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman reiterated the United States ' stance that the two helicopters were over Afghan territory . `` The Pakistanis need to provide the U.S. a reason to why this took place , '' he said . The ISAF issued a news release saying that `` ISAF helicopters received small-arms fire from a Pakistan military checkpoint along the border near Tanai district , Khowst . '' `` At no time did ISAF helicopters cross into Pakistani airspace . '' The ISAF did not mention ground troops or say whether the helicopters returned fire . Both the ISAF and Pakistani military said they are working to resolve the issue . Last week , Zardari said Pakistan would not allow foreign nations to violate its sovereignty to pursue terrorists . `` We will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism , '' he said in his first speech to Parliament as president . His remark followed a similar declaration from Pakistan 's military chief , Gen. Parvez Kayani , who said this month that Pakistan 's territorial integrity `` will be defended at all cost , and no external force is allowed to conduct operations . '' A senior defense official in the Pentagon said the Pentagon is trying to determine the details of Thursday 's incident . `` What we do n't know if this was just a case of trigger-happy members of the Frontier Corps , '' the official said , `` or whether in fact the Pakistani military does have orders to fire on our helicopters . '' `` We are confident our helicopters were on the Afghan side of the border , and we have no report they fired back , '' the official added . Top U.S. commanders will be talking to the Pakistani military about the incident to determine if there was a misunderstanding and to ensure it does n't happen again , a U.S. official familiar with details of the incident said . The official said this is the first verified incident of U.S. troops being fired upon by Pakistani forces . There were at least two previous reports in recent days out of Pakistan about similar incidents , but the United States has said neither of those reports was true . Reza Sayah in Pakistan , CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and CNN senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre contributed to this story .","question":""}

The Tarsem Singh-directed visual feast , which stars Henry Cavill and Freida Pinto , also revives the ancient epic genre 's viability in 2011 after flop openings from `` The Eagle '' -LRB- $ 8.7 mil -RRB- and `` Conan the Barbarian '' -LRB- $ 10 mil -RRB- . For Relativity , a $ 32 million debut -LRB- 66 percent of which came from 3-D screens -RRB- is a major win . The studio spent a surprisingly small $ 75 million on the film , and a rep told me on Friday that they were hoping for a $ 25-26 million start . Now , Relativity is hoping that broad appeal will continue to drive attendance . The studio 's exit polling reveals that `` Immortals ' '' audience was 60\/40 percent male\/female and ethnically diverse as well -- 35 percent Hispanic , 30 percent Caucasian , 13 percent Asian , and 12 percent African-American . According to Kyle Davies , Relativity 's President of Worldwide Theatrical Distribution , `` A lot of people are enjoying the picture , and when you look down the road going into the holidays , there 's just nothing for the action fans , so I think that 's good for us . '' But will the film actually continue to perform well into the Thanksgiving holiday ? That could be difficult . `` Immortals '' looks like it may already be suffering from the fanboy effect , which occurs when eager sci-fi fans rush out to the theater en masse on opening night , thereby inflating numbers on the front end of a film 's box office run . This can often lead precipitous drops in the days\/weeks that follow . Just look at `` Immortals ' '' weekend trajectory : the flick earned $ 15 million on Friday , followed by a 32 percent drop to $ 10.2 million on Saturday -LRB- while the rest of the Top 10 increased by an average of 8 percent -RRB- , followed by a more-standard 33 percent decline to $ 6.8 million on Sunday . Davies attributes the large Friday-to-Saturday drop to the fact that Veterans Day fell on a Friday . He claims that with kids out of school all day , Fridays numbers were boosted substantially . We 'll have to wait and see how `` Immortals , '' which earned an alright `` B '' CinemaScore grade , does in the weeks to come . In second place -LRB- for now -RRB- was Adam Sandler 's latest comedy , `` Jack and Jill , '' which scored a $ 26 million debut out of 3,438 theaters -- good for a $ 7,563 per theater average . Sony 's $ 80 million picture performed within expectations , but when compared to the rest of Sandler 's bawdy mainstream comedy wheelhouse , this is one of his poorer results , and his worst live-action comedic opening -LRB- not including 2009\u00e2 $ \u00b2 s death-themed dramedy `` Funny People '' -RRB- since `` Little Nicky '' 's $ 16.1 million bow in 2000 . `` Jack and Jill '' received atrocious reviews , and while those have never stopped Sandler 's films from succeeding in the past , there is a sense that the summation of so many truly awful critical reactions back-to-back-to-back -- when not balanced by winking affection for lovably dumb films like `` Big Daddy '' and `` Anger Management '' -- may actually be hurting Sandler 's golden box office record . That being said , it 's too soon to write off `` Jack and Jill . '' Working in the cross-dressing comedy 's favor is a family-friendly PG-rating , which could help `` Jack and Jill '' hold nicely with parents and children as we move into the extra-lucrative holidays -- although `` Happy Feet Two , '' `` Hugo , '' `` The Muppets , '' and `` Arthur Christmas '' will provide ample competition . But the comedy , which received a fair `` B '' CinemaScore grade , will have to work very hard to reach the $ 100 million plateau that Sandler is so used to . After two weekends in first place , `` Puss in Boots '' settled for third -LRB- though it may swap places with `` Jack and Jill '' once final results are released tomorrow -RRB- with an estimated $ 25.5 million . The `` Shrek '' spin-off only dropped 3 percent last weekend , and this time around , `` Puss '' scored another terrific 23 percent decline . The $ 130 million DreamWorks picture , which looked like a bust when it opened , has now earned a robust $ 103 million . With a Thanksgiving boost , `` Puss in Boots '' should march right past the $ 160 million mark with ease . `` Tower Heist '' drooped 45 percent this weekend to $ 13.2 million , giving the $ 85 million Universal caper a ten-day total of $ 43.9 million . The one-two punch of Brett Ratner 's Oscar ousting and `` Tower Heist '' 's underperformance have certainly taken the director down a few notches this week . Rounding out the top 5 was Warner Brothers ' $ 35 million biopic `` J. Edgar . '' The Clint Eastwood film , which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as infamous FBI figurehead J. Edgar Hoover , earned $ 11.5 million out of 1,910 theaters , giving it a solid $ 6,005 venue average . The tepidly reviewed drama opened slightly below Eastwood 's last tepidly reviewed drama , `` Hereafter , '' which earned $ 12 million in its first opening weekend last year . `` J. Edgar '' may finish in the same range as `` Hereafter , '' which grossed $ 32.7 million total . The film played much like Leonardo DiCaprio 's 2008 misfire `` Body of Lies , '' another film that paired him with a prestige director -LRB- Ridley Scott -RRB- , but did n't connect with audiences and opened with $ 12.8 million . For DiCaprio , `` J. Edgar '' is no `` Inception '' or `` Shutter Island , '' but the star has always modulated between mainstream crowd-pleasers and smaller , more serious fare , and his star is not in danger . Audiences issued `` J. Edgar '' an uninspiring `` B '' CinemaScore grade . In limited release , two films stood out . After being available on-demand for a three weeks , Lars Von Trier 's `` Melancholia '' still debuted with a solid $ 265,000 out of 19 theaters , leading to a $ 13,947 per theater average . Meanwhile , Emilio Estevez 's directorial effort `` The Way '' has quietly hiked all the way to $ 2.6 million over six weeks -LRB- $ 334,000 from 171 locations this weekend -RRB- , despite never playing in more than 283 theaters . The Martin Sheen drama is clearly experiencing good word-of-mouth on a small scale , so it will be interesting to see if `` The Way '' 's distributor , Producer 's Distribution Agency , pushes the film any harder in an effort to garner awards attention . In milestone news , `` Paranormal Activity 3 '' has now earned $ 100.8 million after five weekends thanks to its $ 3.6 million frame . It has grossed $ 189 million worldwide against a $ 5 million budget . Where 's the sequel announcement , Paramount ? 1 . Immortals -- $ 32 million 2 . Jack and Jill -- $ 26 mil 3 . Puss in Boots -- $ 25.5 mil 4 . Tower Heist -- $ 13.2 mil 5 . J. Edgar -- $ 11.5 mil See the full article at EW.com CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly \u00a9 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. . All rights reserved .","question":""}
{"answer":"Orlando , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Golfer Tiger Woods will be issued a careless driving citation for the crash outside his home last week , but he will not face criminal charges , the Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday . Woods , 33 , struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere , Florida , early Friday , police said . Upon conviction of careless driving , a moving violation , Woods faces a $ 164 fine and four points on his license , Maj. Cindy Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol said . `` Mr. Woods ' status in no way impacted our investigation or conclusion , '' Williams said . `` The investigation has determined that Mr. Woods is at fault in the crash . '' Woods satisfied the requirements of Florida law regarding motor vehicle accidents by providing his driver 's license , registration and proof of insurance to authorities , Williams said . `` With the issuance of this citation , the Florida Highway Patrol has completed its investigation into this matter , '' she said . There was insufficient evidence to request a subpoena for medical information in the case , said Sgt. Kim Montes , an FHP spokeswoman . There were no claims of domestic abuse . Authorities have said they do n't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home around 2:25 a.m. Friday . State troopers three times have asked to question him about the accident , but he has declined , the highway patrol has said . What do you think about the Tiger Woods saga ? Police have said the accident was not alcohol-related . Woods canceled plans to attend the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California `` due to injuries sustained in a one-car accident last week , '' according to a statement Monday from the golfer . In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site , Woods offered no details of his accident except to say he had cuts and bruises and was `` pretty sore . '' `` This situation is my fault , and it 's obviously embarrassing to my family and me , '' he said . `` I 'm human and I 'm not perfect . I will certainly make sure this does n't happen again . '' Woods is a four-time winner of the tournament . A knee injury kept him from competing last year . `` I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week , '' Woods said . `` I am certain it will be an outstanding event , and I 'm very sorry that I ca n't be there . '' People holding tickets for the event -- which runs Wednesday through Sunday -- can apply for full refunds starting next Monday , tournament officials said . Ticketholders who do not ask for refunds can get a 20 percent discount when buying 2010 tickets , they said . The annual charity event , which Woods hosts in Thousand Oaks , California , is a major fundraiser for the Tiger Woods Foundation , but it was not immediately clear how much money it would lose because of Woods ' cancellation . The incident has ended Woods ' golf appearances until next season , according to a statement posted on his Web site . The PGA Tour has ended for the year , but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away . At least one other charity event is scheduled , but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend . Woods has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament four times each , as well as three U.S. Open Championships . Last week , a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess . The woman denied having an affair with Woods when contacted by The Associated Press . The woman in question has retained Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred , who is know for handling high-profile cases , to represent her . Allred told CNN there were no immediate plans for a news conference , although she may soon release a written statement . Windermere 's mayor called on the news media to back away from the story , saying , `` Our residents would like to put this behind us . '' `` It 's time to move on , '' Mayor Gary Bruhn said . `` Let the man recover if he is injured , and let him get back to his life , and let our residents get back to normalcy . '' Woods ' agent , Mark Steinberg , said the Florida Highway Patrol informed them that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional . `` Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity , it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family . '' Under Florida law , Woods is not obligated to give a statement about the crash . His attorney , Mark NeJame , handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods ' home , Montes said . Investigators had sought possible surveillance tapes of the accident from neighbors , but none were found , she said . In his statement , Woods praised his wife , Elin Nordegren , who he said `` acted courageously when she saw I was hurt and in trouble . '' Nordegren told police she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle , and then pulled Woods from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home . But Woods said , `` This is a private matter , and I want to keep it that way . '' And , he added , `` The only person responsible for the accident is me . '' Woods and his wife have two children , a 2-year-old and a baby born in February . CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Alan Duke , Ross Levitt and Marc Balinsky contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An ex-convict , a mobster , a serial killer -- after more than two decades in the movie business , Ray Liotta is still perhaps best known for these `` bad guy '' roles in such films as `` Something Wild '' and `` GoodFellas . '' Ray Liotta -LRB- right -RRB- co-stars with Seth Rogen in `` Observe and Report , '' which opened Friday . But in his most recent film , `` Observe and Report '' -- a dark comedy co-starring Seth Rogen as a bipolar mall security guard and Anna Faris as the vapid make-up counter clerk he 's in love with -- Liotta inches away from his edgy persona to play a detective investigating a flashing incident at the mall . `` A flasher keeps flashing people at the mall , so they call in the ` real police , ' which is me , '' Liotta told the Columbus Dispatch . `` The last thing I want to do is investigate .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Qatari man held for years in military custody in the United States was charged Friday in federal court with conspiracy `` to provide material support and resources '' to al Qaeda , prosecutors announced . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . The Supreme Court was to hear arguments in April on a challenge by the suspect , Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri , to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges . The Justice Department on Friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal . `` Because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended , no live controversy remains in this case , '' said Obama administration lawyers in their brief . Al-Marri 's lawyers oppose such a move , saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered . The federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution . Andy Savage , one of al-Marri 's lawyers , visited him at the naval brig in North Charleston , South Carolina , on Friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism . `` He denies it , '' Savage said . `` I 'm sure he 'll enter a not guilty plea . '' Savage said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment . `` We 'd like information about what he 's supposed to have done , '' he said . `` You 'd think after 7 1\/2 years they 'd have a little more to say . `` The most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future . Before , he did n't know if he 'd be charged , be repatriated or held forever . '' The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . He had been accused of being an al Qaeda sleeper agent , but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . He will be transferred at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . Oral arguments in the case are scheduled April 27 . A Justice Department official said the White House will release an official presidential order to transfer al-Marri into civilian custody . Al-Marri 's lawyer applauded the move . `` This indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts . This case is now finally where it belongs : in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether Mr. al-Marri is guilty of a crime , '' said Jonathan Hafetz , an ACLU attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . Obama late Friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , calling it `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri , a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States , has remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention . They said his cell at the brig in South Carolina is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world , including his family . Military officials deny mistreatment . The case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations . President George W. Bush ordered al-Marri confined in military custody , and the Bush Justice Department had been filing the appeals opposing al-Marri 's legal claims . At issue was whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil . Al-Marri arrived in the United States the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria . He had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier . Weeks later , he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home . At an early court hearing , a prosecutor said al-Marri was believed to be an associate of al Qaeda , the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the 9\/11 attacks . The case against al-Marri escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated al Qaeda detainees , the government said . Although al-Marri was not charged with terrorism-related offenses , Bush in June 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an `` enemy combatant '' and transferring him to military custody . That move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention . The declaration alleges al-Marri engaged in `` hostile and warlike acts '' working as an `` al Qaeda sleeper agent '' who was planning to `` hack into the computer systems of U.S banks , '' for a possible follow-up to the 9\/11 attacks . The Pentagon said he had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to the government 's filing with the high court . A lawyer for Jose Padilla , an American citizen detained as an enemy combatant , said the government 's actions in the al-Marri case echo those in Padilla 's , in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the Supreme Court . `` This is deja vu all over again -- what the Bush administration did with Padilla , the Obama administration is trying to do with al-Marri , '' he said . `` Transferring al-Marri out of the brig is the right thing to do . Moving to dismiss the case is not . '' The case is U.S. v. al-Marri -LRB- 09-CR-10030 -RRB- . CNN 's Carol Cratty and Pam Benson contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Panama City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His fate uncertain , Manuel Noriega is being returned Sunday to Panama , nearly 22 years after the former dictator was forcibly removed from office by U.S. forces . Now 77 , Noriega is being extradited this weekend from France , which got Noriega in April 2010 after he spent two decades in an American prison . Panamanian officials want him to face justice in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora , a doctor and political opponent of Noriega . Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985 . After a stop in Spain , Noriega is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon in Panama City . For almost two decades , Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal , a key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas . While in U.S. custody , Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke . Authorities have strengthened security to guarantee Noriega 's safety in prison , Panamanian Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez said . `` We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects . Noriega inspires very big emotions , and Noriega 's life could very well be at risk in Panama , '' Henriquez said . Judicial officials in Panama will determine whether Noriega can stand trial , Henriquez said . Interior Minister Roxana Mendez said Noriega will receive the same treatment as other inmates at the Renacer prison complex . `` The Panamanian state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex , '' Mendez said . `` However , based on our laws , and if there 's a valid request from his attorneys , they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate 's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate , being over 70 years old , may face risks inside the prison complex . '' Last year , a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering money through French banks . He also was fined almost 2.3 million euros -LRB- $ 2.9 million -RRB- , the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks . Noriega denied the charges . During the trial , defense lawyer Yves Leberquier tried to paint Noriega as the victim of larger geopolitical forces , accusing the United States of placing and moving pawns to serve its interests . The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments . He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States . Born in 1934 , Noriega was abandoned by his parents at the age of 5 and raised by an aunt in a rundown district of Panama City . After failing to get into medical school , Noriega joined the army , studying at Peru 's Military Academy of Chorrillos and quickly rising through the ranks . In the 1970s he served as head of military intelligence to Gen. Omar Torrijos , who had seized power in a military coup in 1968 . Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981 , and Noriega emerged as his de facto successor . By 1983 he controlled both Panama 's armed forces and civilian government . In 1988 Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking . He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar 's notorious Medellin cartel and , in the process , amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune . Amid growing unrest in Panama , U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989 , claiming that Noriega 's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property . Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City . U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound , blaring music at all hours , a psychological ploy to rattle the general . He surrendered in January 1990 and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial . During his 2010 trial in France , Noriega said , `` I received high praise from the U.S. , Interpol and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was released from jail early Monday morning , just hours after she was booked in , authorities said . Lohan , 25 , checked herself into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood , California , at 8:48 p.m. Sunday , the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department said on its website . By 3:10 a.m. Monday , Lohan had been released , Sheriff 's Deputy Mark Pope said . Last week , a Los Angeles County judge ordered Lohan to serve a 30-day jail term after she admitted she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction . At the time , Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said it was likely Lohan could be booked in and booked out the same day . `` It depends on the fluctuations of the day , what 's going on in the jail , '' Whitmore said . The actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service , Judge Stephanie Sautner told her . Lohan must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions . If Lohan misses any of those goals , she will be returned to jail for another 270 days , the judge ruled . `` This is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant 's hands , '' Sautner told Lohan . Lohan 's spokesman , Steve Honig , said Monday , `` Lindsay is very focused on fulfilling her community service obligation so she can put all of this behind her . '' The actress admitted violating her probation during a hearing Wednesday . `` You are not to get house arrest or early release , except for that required by the law , '' Sautner said . Whitmore said that the early release program is part of the law , meaning Lohan would likely get out quickly due to overcrowding . Lohan did a short stint in jail last year . When Sautner sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail last May , she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead , due to jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior . It was not immediately clear how many days Lohan will actually serve this month if she ends up getting credit for good behavior . Prosecutors said Lohan missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown Los Angeles women 's center , part of the court-ordered community service imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice , California , jewelry store . Lohan was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007 . She also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court-ordered psychotherapy , they said . `` From what I see of you , you need a structure , '' Sautner told Lohan last week . The judge instructed Lohan to return to court each month , starting December 14 , to show she is complying with the schedule . If the actress stays on track , her probation would be eased on March 29 , 2012 , Sautner said . If she does n't keep up with the requirements , she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars , the judge said . The full sentence imposed Wednesday was 150 days for the necklace theft probation violation and 150 days for violating probation on the 2007 drunk driving conviction in Beverly Hills . While the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown Los Angeles women 's center , the judge said she did not want to put the Skid Row charity through the pain of Lohan again . When the judge called The Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women , the charity refused to take Lohan on as a worker , `` saying you were a bad example , '' Sautner said . But Lohan seemed to find a good fit with her work at the Los Angeles County morgue , where Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up . `` So , the morgue is willing to keep you , '' the judge said . All of her community service work has been transferred there , she said . In October , the actress ' father , Michael Lohan , told HLN 's `` Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell '' program that his daughter should n't be in jail , but in rehab . Michael Lohan was arrested twice in two days last month for violating a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend . CNN learned last week that he is now in an `` administrative confinement '' cell in the infirmary section of Orient Road jail in Tampa , Florida , where he was awaiting trial . Lindsay Lohan 's legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests , have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes . Her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless Lohan breaks any laws before then . It has been extended several times because of violations , including failed alcohol and drug tests .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Republican presidential debate on Tuesday focused on national security issues exposed deep fault lines within the GOP over how to grapple with the nation 's challenges overseas . The eight Republican candidates who took to the CNN debate stage in downtown Washington differed on a range of issues confronting the United States , including the war in Afghanistan , aid to Pakistan and cuts in defense spending . The issue of illegal immigration also arose again as the newest Republican front-runner , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , called for a `` humane '' approach to immigration policy , a position at odds with many conservative activists who dominate key nominating contests in Iowa , South Carolina and Florida . Gingrich stressed the importance of securing the United States border with Mexico and penalizing employers who hire illegal immigrants . But he expressed sympathy for people who entered the country illegally and since became contributing members of society . Blog : The CNN debate as it happened `` I do n't see how the party that says it 's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families which have been here a quarter-century , '' Gingrich said . `` And I am prepared to take the heat for saying , let 's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship , but finding a way to give them legality so as not to separate them from their families . '' The answer was reminiscent of Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's response to a question about a 2001 bill he signed that granted in-state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants . In a September debate , Perry said Republicans who oppose the legislation `` do n't have a heart '' -- and his standing in the polls plummeted in the following days . Romney , the party 's de facto front-runner for much of the year , pounced on Gingrich 's remarks . `` Amnesty is a magnet , '' Romney said . `` When we have had in the past programs that have said that if people who come here illegally are going to get to stay illegally for the rest of their life , that 's going to only encourage more people to come here illegally . '' iReport : What makes a good presidential candidate ? Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann , a member of the House Intelligence Committee who had one of her strongest debate performances of the cycle , also chided Gingrich . `` We need to move away from magnets , not offer more , '' said Bachmann , who is in single digits in the polls and pegging her candidacy to a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses . The debate was held at Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall in downtown Washington and was co-sponsored by the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute , two conservative think tanks . Gingrich entered the debate with fresh momentum in the Republican race and found himself in the spotlight for much of the evening . According to a CNN\/ORC International Poll released on the eve of the debate , 24 % of Republican and GOP-leaning independent voters said they are most likely to support Gingrich for their party 's nomination , with 20 % saying they back Romney , who is making his second bid for the presidency . Gingrich 's four-point margin over Romney is within the survey 's sampling error . A CNN poll released one week ago had Romney at 24 % and Gingrich at 22 % . Gingrich was at 8 % in a CNN poll in October . The new front-runner got the first question of the night , which sparked a feud with the libertarian-leaning Texas Rep. Ron Paul over the USA Patriot Act . `` I would look at strengthening it because the dangers that are posed are so great , '' Gingrich said about the legislation . Paul , who has been sharply critical of the Patriot Act since it was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in October 2001 , called it `` unpatriotic '' because it `` undermines our liberty . '' Paul took on the role of the lonely isolationist throughout the debate , calling on the administration to withdraw American troops from commitments overseas as a way to slash government spending . He also questioned the point of humanitarian aid , including money to combat AIDS and other diseases in Africa . `` I think the aid is all worthless , '' Paul said . `` It does n't do any good for most of the people . You take money from poor people in this country and you end up giving it to rich people in poorer countries . '' In the night 's sharpest clash , Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman battled over the American military presence in Afghanistan . Huntsman , a former ambassador to China and the sole candidate with diplomatic experience , said he wants to withdraw most American troops from the country and instead rely on Predator drones and a small contingent of forces to fight terrorists . `` Are you suggesting , governor , that we just take all our troops out next week ? '' Romney asked . `` Did you hear what I just said ? '' Huntsman fired back . `` I said we should draw down from 100,000 . We do n't need 100,000 troops , many of whom ca n't even cross the wire . '' When Romney said the president should rely on the generals on the ground , Huntsman again responded aggressively . `` At the end of the day the president of the United States is commander-in-chief , '' he said . `` Of course you 're going to listen to the generals . But I also remember when people listened to the generals in 1967 and we heard a certain course of action in Southeast Asia that did n't serve our interests very well . '' The candidates were also pressed on how they would change airport security measures if elected president . Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would privatize the Transportation Security Administration . Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said his administration would apply `` more scrutiny '' to Muslim passengers in airports , as did former Godfather 's Pizza CEO Herman Cain . `` If you take a look at the people who are trying to kill us it would be easy to figure out , '' Cain said . Later , Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann dueled with Perry over his proposal to scrap all funding for foreign governments like Pakistan , which may not agree with American interests , and ask them to make the case for American funding . Perry said the government should stop writing `` blank checks '' to Pakistan , but Bachmann called that proposal `` na\u00c3 \u00af ve '' because the country has nuclear weapons that must be protected . `` Al Qaeda could get a hold of these weapons , '' Bachmann said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some of the worst fighting to hit Somalia 's capital city in recent months uprooted nearly 34,000 people in less than a week , according to a United Nations report released Monday . A young girl feeds her baby brother at a refugee camp on the outskirts of Mogadishu , Somalia . Relief workers said the fighting between the Somali government and rebels over Islamic law has left Somali civilians with the choice of facing bloody battles or fleeing to squalid camps . The displaced people have found shelter in already overcrowded camps in and around Mogadishu , while others have fled into neighboring Kenya , according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- OCHA -RRB- . OCHA said that an estimated 34,000 people were displaced by the fighting between insurgents and Somalia 's government from May 8-14 . Although Somalia 's border with Kenya is officially closed , an estimated 5,000 displaced Somalis arrive every month in the U.N. refugee camps in the Kenyan border town of Dadaab , according to Doctors Without Borders , known by its French acronym MSF . `` The situation is simply scandalous , '' said Joke Van Peteghem , who heads the MSF mission in Kenya . `` These refugees have risked everything to escape the fighting in Somalia . Now some are telling us they would rather take their chances in Mogadishu than die slowly here . '' One nurse called the refugee camps in Kenya `` public health time bombs . '' `` The refugees , many of whom are already suffering from serious war-related injuries or illnesses , are packed together without the bare minimum to survive , '' said Donna Canali , who worked for MSF at Dagahaley Camp . `` After all these people have endured , how can their most basic needs continue to be so woefully neglected ? '' Nearly a quarter of the more than 90,000 refugees at Dagahaley suffer from acute malnutrition , according to MSF . MSF is calling on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , Kenya 's government , and international donors to help alleviate the `` dire living conditions '' at the camps in Kenya which house more than 270,000 Somali refugees . More than 100 people have died in the latest fighting in Somalia , and hundreds more have been wounded in the bloody insurgency , government officials said last week . The violence stems from an interpretation of sharia , or Islamic law . Somalia 's new president , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , recently approved implementing sharia , but the al-Shabab rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form . On Sunday , al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar , the president 's hometown about 55 miles -LRB- 88 km -RRB- north of Mogadishu , according to a local journalist . The violence is exacerbating the already precarious humanitarian situation in Somalia , where an estimated 40 percent of the country 's population -- more than 3 million people -- need humanitarian support , according to the U.N. . The fighting erupted days after a mortar attack on Somalia 's parliament that killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others on April 25 . The fatalities included a soldier and three children who were killed when the rounds struck a nearby school , a police spokesman said . Members of parliament were meeting when the attack occurred , but none of them was injured , an official said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ghana international Michael Essien has followed goalkeeper Petr Cech in agreeing a new five-year contract with English Premier League side Chelsea . Michael Essien has made a big impression on new Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari . The midfielder , who is in China for the start of the club 's pre-season tour , is now tied to the London outfit until the summer of 2013 . The 25-year-old has made 143 appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge from French club Lyon in a $ 49 million transfer in August 2005 , scoring 14 goals in total and helping Chelsea win the league title that season . Essien 's decision to commit his long-term future to the club is a boost for new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari , who allowed veteran holding midfielder Claude Makelele to join Paris St Germain on Monday . `` I have not been here long but it is clear to me that Michael Essien is one of the best midfield players in the world , '' Scolari said . `` I have always admired him and it is good news for me and for Chelsea that he signs for so long . '' The Accra-born Essien , who started his career in France with Bastia in 2000 before moving to Lyon three years later , was also pleased with the deal . `` I am really pleased to have extended my career with Chelsea , '' he said . `` I am very happy here . We have a great team and fantastic fans who have always made me welcome . `` With the addition of the new manager , I am feeling very positive about the season ahead . '' Chelsea announced on Monday that Czech Republic goalkeeper Cech signed a new five-year deal , while England full-back Wayne Bridge committed himself to four more years last week . Scolari is still seeking to keep England midfielder Frank Lampard , who has ended talks over a new deal and now appears to be resigned to waiting until his contract runs out before joining Inter Milan following the upcoming season . The Brazilian has so far added only Portugal playmaker Deco to his midfield ranks . His first match in charge will be Wednesday 's friendly against Guangzhou Pharmaceutical , one of the three games the team will play in China . Striker Didier Drogba , who has been linked with moves to AC Milan and Barcelona , is not among the touring squad due to a recurring knee problem . Khalid Boulahrouz , meanwhile , completed his transfer from Chelsea to Stuttgart on a four-year contract with the Bundesliga club . The Netherlands central defender was released Monday by Chelsea and arrived in Stuttgart 's training camp in Austria shortly before midnight after passing a medical exam in Stuttgart . The deal between Stuttgart and Chelsea was completed Tuesday . Details were not given . The Dutchman played for Hamburger SV for two seasons before going to Chelsea in 2006 . He was loaned to FC Sevilla last season . Boulahrouz 's departure came a day after 35-year-old former France international Claude Makelele signed a two-year deal with Paris-Saint Germain after joining from Chelsea on a free transfer .","question":""}
{"answer":"Mexico City , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least two car bombs exploded Friday near the television studios of Televisa in Ciudad Victoria , the capital of Tamaulipas state in northeastern Mexico , authorities said . One blast occurred outside the TV station while the second happened next to the municipal transit service offices , said the state attorney general 's office . No fatalities or injuries were reported . The nearly simultaneous blasts occurred shortly after midnight . The explosion in front of Televisa , a CNN affiliate , damaged the building and knocked out power on the block , the station said . The station also was knocked off the air locally , Televisa said . Images of one of the blasts show the carcass of a car , the explosion leaving only the vehicle 's mangled frame but not causing much damage to nearby buildings or trees . The wreckage lies next to a wooden street pole that is slightly tilted and holds a stop sign . The car that exploded in front of the television studio was a red Chevrolet Corsica with Texas license plates , the attorney general 's office said in a news release . The car in front of the transit office was a white Mazda , also with Texas license plates , officials said . Tamaulipas is the state where authorities discovered 72 bodies this week on a ranch believed to be used by narcotraffickers . Authorities are investigating whether the 58 men and 14 women , who were migrants from Central and South America , were killed by the Zetas cartel . Televisa previously came under attack August 15 when a grenade damaged apartments near the TV station 's office in the city of Monterrey in neighboring Nuevo Leon state . There were no reports of injuries in that attack . A similar attack occurred the previous day , when a grenade was launched against the Televisa offices in the city of Matamoros , in Tamaulipas . The building was damaged but there were no reports of injuries . It was not clear Friday why Televisa is being targeted . Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon have become a bloody battleground between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel , which ended an alliance earlier this year . The Zetas used to be the armed branch of the Gulf Cartel but have split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization . Journalists have come under increasing attack in Mexico , as drug cartels try to limit the information being distributed about their activities . The Committee to Protect Journalists , an independent , nonprofit organization , criticized this month 's grenade attacks against Televisa . `` No journalist is safe in Mexico when criminal groups feel free to wage grenade attacks on a national broadcaster , '' said Carlos Lauria , the organization 's senior program coordinator for the Americas . `` Drug traffickers are increasingly terrorizing the press and defining what is news and what is n't . We urge the Mexican authorities must fully investigate these incidents and bring those responsible to justice . '' Eight journalists were killed in Mexico in 2009 and another eight have been killed so far this year , the Committee to Protect Journalists said this month . In total , 54 journalists and media workers have been slain in Mexico since 1992 , the group said . Car bombings by Mexican cartels are a new phenomena . Among the first was a July 15 explosion in Ciudad Juarez that killed four people .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coalition troops killed the al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the February 2006 attack on Samarra 's al-Askariya mosque and set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites , the U.S. military said Sunday . The attack on Samarra 's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites . Haitham Sabah al-Badri , the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra , was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra , said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference . `` Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra , '' Fox said . `` We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq . '' Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri , according to a U.S. military news release . During the raid , at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces , the release said . The coalition forces called in close air support , killing al-Badri and the three others , the release said . One of those killed was identified as a foreigner ; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives , the military said . El-Badri 's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official . No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque , one of the holiest Shiite sites , but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17 1\/2 months since the attack . In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque 's dome , another bombing in June destroyed the shrine 's two remaining minarets . Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks , including two last year , Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers . Samarra is in Salaheddin province , north of Baghdad . Mortar attacks kill 11 Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad on Sunday , killing at least 11 people and wounding 15 others , a spokesman with Iraq 's Interior Ministry said . The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. -LRB- 12 a.m. ET -RRB- , the spokesman said . Suicide bombers attacked two gas stations Wednesday , killing 70 people , Reuters reported . Meanwhile , coalition forces said Saturday they killed four suspected militants and detained 18 thought to have helped make or plant roadside bombs , the U.S. military said . The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr 's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militias operating in Iraq , the military said . Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldier 's sentence A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to 110 years in confinement for participating in the rape of a 14-year-old girl and the killings of her and her family in Iraq , an Army spokeswoman said . The girl 's family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment and would have preferred to see the death penalty handed down in the case . Pfc. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape , conspiracy to commit rape , housebreaking with the intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder . The girl , her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya , south of Baghdad . `` We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals and the place to carry out the sentence is where the incident happened , '' the girl 's cousin , Abu Ammar , told Reuters . Her uncle , Hadi Abdullah , told the wire agency that family members wished there was a way to appeal the sentence so the death penalty could be imposed . Three soldiers have previously pleaded guilty in the case and were given sentences ranging from five to 100 years . The accused ringleader , former Pvt. Steven Green , was discharged from the Army and awaits trial in a civilian court . Other developments CNN 's Pierre Bairin and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He was known as the Wizard of Westwood , the architect of a dynasty at UCLA that will never be equaled . But John Wooden leaves behind a legacy much larger than victories on a basketball court . Wooden died Friday of natural causes at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center . He was 99 . His 100th birthday would have been October 14 . Wooden 's children , Nan and Jim Wooden , issued a statement asking that donations be made in his name to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation or another charity of choice . `` He has been , and always will be , the guiding light for our family . The love , guidance and support he has given us will never be forgotten , '' the said . `` Our peace of mind at this time is knowing that he has gone to be with our mother , whom he has continued to love and cherish . '' Wooden had been admitted to the hosptial on May 26 . Funeral services will be private , but the family said there would be a public memorial at a later date , with a reception for former players and coaches . `` There will never be another John Wooden , '' said UCLA Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero . `` While this is a huge loss for the Bruin family , Coach Wooden 's influence reaches far beyond Westwood . Coach was a tremendously significant figure . `` This loss will be felt by individuals from all parts of society . He was not only the greatest coach in the history of any sport but he was an exceptional individual that transcended the sporting world . His enduring legacy as a role model is one we should all strive to emulate . '' `` This is a sad day at UCLA , '' said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block . `` Coach Wooden 's legacy transcends athletics ; what he did was produce leaders . '' Wooden was born on a farm in Martinsville , Indiana , in 1910 and learned to play basketball on an iron hoop that his father had forged and attached to the barn . He went to college at Purdue , winning All-America honors three times and leading the Boilermakers to the 1932 national collegiate championship . After marrying his high school sweetheart and life-long love Nell following his graduation , Wooden coached at the high school level and at Indiana State before being hired by UCLA in 1948 . His coaching methods , like his upbringing , seemed like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting : Simple , yet elegant . `` If there 's anything you could point out where I was a little different , it was the fact that i never mentioned winning , '' he once said . In 27 years at UCLA , his Bruins won an unprecedented 10 national championships in 12 years , including seven straight from 1967 to 1973 . UCLA also captured 19 conference titles and set an NCAA record with 88 consecutive wins over four seasons , but Wooden was more proud of his players accomplishments off the court . `` I think that 's the factor from which i have received the greatest satisfaction and pleasure . The fact that practically all of my players did get their degrees and practically all of them have done well in whatever their chosen profession might be , '' he said . Wooden retired from UCLA in 1975 , following his 10th national championship but would occasionally take in a Bruins game from the stands . Former Cal coach Pete Newell once said , `` John was a better coach at 55 than he was at 50 . He was a better coach at 60 than at 55 . He 's a true example of a man who learned from day one to day last . '' Wooden is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame both as a coach and as a player -- one of only two men to attain that honor -- and many of the men he coached went on to stellar careers as well . Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- then Lew Alcindor -RRB- , Gail Goodrich and Bill Walton all landed in the Basketball Hall of Fame beside their college coach , while others played in the NBA or even returned to UCLA later in Wooden 's footsteps . But Wooden 's legacy extended beyond his basketball expertise -- he coached leadership . He frequently recited what he termed his father 's `` two sets of three '' -- `` never lie , never cheat , never steal '' and `` do n't whine , do n't complain , do n't make excuses . '' And his well-known `` Pyramid of Success , '' begun in the 1930s , has been the system behind the success of many . `` His ` Pyramid of Success ' hangs in my office to remind me every day of what it takes to be an effective leader , '' Block said . `` He was truly a legend in his own time , and he will be a legend for generations to come . '' Wooden himself called the pyramid `` the only truly original thing I have ever done . '' The base of his five-level pyramid is made up of industriousness , friendship , loyalty , cooperation and enthusiasm . The next levels up are self-control , alertness , initiative and intentness , then condition , skill and team spirit followed by and poise and confidence . At the pinnacle is competitive greatness , which he defined as performing at top ability when that is required -- `` each day . '' `` Success is peace of mind , which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable , '' Wooden once said in explaining the pyramid .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eight former executives and agents of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries have been indicted in a bribery scheme alleging that they paid or promised Argentine officials $ 100 million to land a contract worth 10 times as much , the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday . They are charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , wire fraud and money laundering . None of the defendants named in the indictment is in the United States . Justice officials said those involved in the decade-long scheme are from Germany , Switzerland , Argentina and other countries . According to the indictment , the Siemens executives paid millions in bribes in 1994 to secure a bid to create a national identity card system in Argentina . After the project faced suspension in 1999 , the defendants are accused of promising even more bribes to the next presidential administration to keep the project afloat . To top it off , once the project met its demise in 2001 , Siemens filed an arbitration claim against Argentina claiming wrongful termination of the contract and seeking $ 500 million in lost profits . The company hid from the proceedings that it had illegally acquired the contract in the first place , the indictment said . Justice Department officials praised Siemen 's cooperation and said the company that has 60,000 employees in the United States played a large and cooperative role in exposing the alleged conspiracy . The eight indicted men include Uriel Sharef , former member of the central executive committee of Siemens AG ; Herbert Steffen , former CEO of Siemens Argentina ; and Andres Truppel , former CFO of Siemens Argentina . Also named in the indictment are Ulrich Bock , Stephan Signer and Eberhard Reichert , former senior executives of Siemens Business Services ; and Carlos Sergi and Miguel Czysch , who were agents of Siemens in the alleged bribe scheme . `` There were few lines these executives were not willing to cross , '' said Robert Khuzami , director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission . Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer said , `` Today 's indictment alleges a shocking level of deception and corruption . '' In short , the company committed to pay more than $ 100 million in bribes to win the $ 1 billion contract , Breuer said . About $ 60 million was allegedly paid , he said . `` Business should be won or lost on the merits of a company 's products and services , not the amount of bribes paid to government officials , '' Breuer said . Ronald Hosko , special agent in charge of the FBI in Washington , said corruption is among the FBI 's highest investigative priorities , adding , `` Foreign bribery is not an acceptable business practice . Backroom deals and corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain business wear away public confidence in our global marketplace . '' If convicted , the defendants could each be sentenced to 20 years in prison and face fines , officials said . CNN 's Jim Barnett contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former State Department employee and his wife , who are accused of spying for Cuba for nearly 30 years , will remain in jail as they await trial , a judge ruled Wednesday . An artist 's sketch shows Walter Kendall Myers , 72 , and his wife , Gwendolyn Myers , 71 , in court Wednesday . Walter Kendall Myers , 72 , and his wife , Gwendolyn Myers , 71 , are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government , wire fraud and providing classified information to Havana , according to court documents . U.S. Magistrate John Facciola ordered the couple Wednesday held without bail after a prosecutor said they posed a flight risk . Investigators found a calendar showing that the couple planned to sail to the Caribbean in November , federal prosecutor Michael Harvey told the court . The two have the financial means to obtain false documents and flee to Cuba with their sailboat or through Mexico or Canada , he said . `` They are unworthy of this court 's trust , '' Harvey added . The couple was quiet and expressionless during the proceedings Wednesday . Kendall Myers sat with his arms folded across his chest , while his wife sat with her arms at her side . They stared straight ahead , and did not appear to acknowledge anyone in the courtroom . A defense attorney urged the court to allow them to remain in their home , where they could visit with their children . `` You could disable the sailboat , freeze their funds and require ankle bracelets , '' Thomas Green said . The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings , but turned down the request to allow them to go home . He said he was concerned that the two would go to the Cuban Interests Section or the embassy of a country that has diplomatic relations with Cuba . Such a move would put them beyond the reach of federal law enforcement agencies . The State Department has not described what information the Myerses may have passed to their Cuban handlers , but said more information would come out after a full assessment . A senior State Department official said Kendall Myers was an `` upper-level civil service employee '' at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research who `` had come up in the ranks . '' U.S. officials did not discuss the Myerses ' motives for their alleged work for the Cuban government . Conviction on the wire fraud charge would carry a sentence of up to 20 years ; illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government would carry a sentence of up to 10 years ; and the conspiracy charge would carry a sentence of up to five years . Myers retired from the State Department on October 31 , 2007 . He had viewed more than 200 classified reports on Cuba in his final months , even though he was an analyst on European issues at the time , court documents say . The couple has been held without bail since pleading not guilty Friday . A future trial date has not been scheduled . CNN 's Carol Cratty contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"CAIRO , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Egyptian business tycoon and a former police officer have been found guilty of last July 's slaying of a rising Lebanese pop singer . Suzanne Tamim was found dead in her Dubai apartment in July . The case , with its high-profile victim and defendant , has captivated Egypt and the region . A judge convicted and sentenced to death real estate mogul Hisham Talaat Moustafa and the former officer Muhsen el Sukkari on Thursday . Egypt 's Grand Mufti -- the country 's highest religious official -- will review the sentence and rule on June 25 if the men will be executed , the judge said . Because the two men were sentenced under Islamic law , it is widely expected that they would be hanged . Moustafa 's lawyer told reporters outside the courtroom that he will appeal the conviction , saying there was `` a one million percent guarantee '' the sentence would be overturned . The singer , Suzanne Tamim , was found slain in her apartment in the United Arab Emirates . She had been stabbed and her throat slit . Prosecutors alleged that Moustafa , a parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party , paid el Sukkari $ 2 million to kill Tamim . During the trial , Moustafa 's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer , but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected . Polygamy is legal in Egypt , and it 's not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa , a married father of three -- to take on additional wives . Prosecutors have said Tamim 's death was a `` means of taking revenge , '' but have not elaborated . Moustafa and el Sukkari claim the prosecution 's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by UAE authorities and should not be used against them . Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates , the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt . After his arrest in September , Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa , stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial . He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father , Talaat Moustafa . Moustafa 's brother , Tarek Talaat Moustafa , now chairs the company . CNN 's Raja Razek and Housam Ahmed contributed to this story .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A German man is facing federal charges in the United States on suspicion of trying to extort money from supermodel Cindy Crawford and her husband , using a photograph of the couple 's then-7-year-old daughter , court documents said . Edis Kayalar is charged with one count of extortion in a criminal complaint filed Thursday , according to Thom Mrozek , spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Central District of California . The photo , apparently taken as a prank by their former nanny , shows the couple 's daughter bound to a chair , court documents said . Kayalar was deported to Germany from the United States in September after he had repeated contacts with Crawford and her husband , business mogul Rande Gerber . However , the complaint against him alleges , he continued to demand money from them . Federal prosecutors are in contact with German authorities on the matter , Mrozek told CNN , but as of Thursday night Kayalar was not in custody . If convicted , Kayalar faces a maximum penalty of two years in federal prison . Kayalar first contacted Crawford and Gerber in July , according to the criminal complaint . He told Crawford , who answered the phone , that he had a photograph of their daughter and wanted to help them out because he is a `` good person , '' the documents said . Crawford then handed the telephone to her husband . Identifying himself as `` Brian , '' Kayalar told Gerber he had a photograph of their daughter in `` revealing clothing , bound to a chair and gagged , '' according to the complaint . He said he had stolen the photograph from the former nanny and that he wanted to return it because it `` bothered '' him and he felt it `` just was n't right , '' the complaint said . He told Gerber he wanted to give up the photograph so it would not end up in the tabloids , according to the documents . Kayalar told Gerber he had met the former nanny at a bar about three months before , when the woman still worked for the couple , and that he had been at her apartment and gotten Crawford 's number from the nanny 's cellular phone while the nanny was sleeping , the complaint said . The couple notified the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department . In the affidavit , an FBI agent states that she reviewed the photograph , which depicts the girl , who has since turned 8 , bound and gagged in a chair and wearing shorts and a T-shirt . The girl told her parents -- who did not know it had been taken -- that the former nanny took it as part of a `` cops and robbers '' game . Kayalar called again , arranging to meet Gerber at a bar in Venice , California , to return the photograph , the court documents said . He did not ask directly for money , but hinted that he was `` broke '' and would like a monetary reward for the return , according to the complaint . Gerber brought a sheriff 's deputy to the meeting . During the meeting , Kayalar told Gerber he did not have the original image with him , saying he had left it with friends for `` security purposes , '' but showed him a copy he had saved on his cellular phone , according to the complaint . He told Gerber stole the photograph from the nanny 's apartment along with a handwritten note saying , `` The baby sitter went crazy and tied everyone up and they need your help ! Please . '' Gerber and the deputy then got Kayalar to call and arrange to meet the former nanny with them . When the former nanny -- who was not identified in court documents -- saw Gerber with Kayalar , she `` became extremely upset and began to cry , '' the court documents said . She apologized to Gerber and told him the photograph had been taken as a prank , and that she initially had planned to put the photograph and the note on the front door of the couple 's home `` in order to pull a prank on Crawford '' but had not done so . On the way back to the bar , Kayalar repeatedly asked Gerber for money , the complaint said , saying that `` he could get a lot of money from the tabloids for the photograph . '' He said he would deliver the photograph to Gerber the following day . Gerber went to meet with Kayalar the next day in Malibu , later telling police he obtained a hard copy of the photograph from him and gave him $ 1,000 `` for his trouble , '' according to the court documents . But two days later , Gerber called police again , saying Kayalar called and demanded more money , saying he still had a copy of the photograph . During the Venice meeting , Kayalar told the sheriff 's deputy he was a German citizen and that his true name was Edis Kayalar , the complaint said . U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found he was in the United States illegally , and he was arrested and deported . In November , Kayalar began calling the couple from Germany , however , saying he had no choice but to demand more money since they had `` gotten him deported , '' court documents said . He said he wanted $ 100,000 for not releasing or selling the photograph to the media . `` Kayalar stated that before , he had not committed any crime , but that now he was committing extortion , '' the complaint said .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The seizure of the Afghan Taliban 's top military leader in Pakistan represents a turning point in the U.S.-led war against the militants , U.S. officials and analysts said . The arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar represents the most significant Taliban capture since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , a senior Obama administration official said Tuesday . Baradar has been a close associate of Osama bin Laden 's and is seen as the No. 2 figure in the Afghan Taliban , behind Mullah Mohammed Omar . `` If anyone would know where the senior leaders are of al Qaeda and the Taliban , then Baradar is someone who would be privy to that kind of information , '' said M.J. Gohel , executive director of the Asia-Pacific Foundation . It 's `` major success for the CIA '' and `` a major blow for the Taliban , '' Gohel said . The United States has tried to target Baradar for years , a senior U.S. official said . The arrest also represents a `` new level of cooperation '' between Pakistani and American forces working to rout the Taliban , said U.S. Sen. John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-author of legislation designed to improve cooperation between Pakistan and the United States . Described as a savvy and modern military leader , Baradar was arrested in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi several days ago , a senior Pakistani intelligence official said . The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media . Baradar is being held in joint custody and investigated by both the CIA and Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence agency , another senior Pakistani source said . Qari Yousuf Ahmadi , a Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan , denied that Baradar had been captured . He said Baradar is continuing his operations and is in Afghanistan . Another Afghan Taliban spokesman , Zabiullah Mujahid , also denied Baradar had been arrested . He said reports of his arrest are designed to demoralize the Afghan Taliban . Despite confirmation of the arrest by Pakistani sources , Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said he could not verify reports of the capture . He also denied reports the CIA and ISI conducted a secret raid that captured Baradar , saying the agencies share intelligence but that the CIA does not conduct raids on Pakistani soil . Afghanistan Crossroads blog : More on Baradar and the Taliban Several raids in Karachi last week netted dozens of suspected Afghan militants , and intelligence agencies are in the process of verifying their identities , Malik said . Baradar 's arrest occurred as some 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces were battling the Taliban in the Marjah region of southern Afghanistan 's Helmand province in the largest NATO offensive since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 . It also comes weeks after the CIA ratcheted up its operations against the Taliban in apparent response to a December suicide attack that killed seven CIA officers in eastern Afghanistan . And the arrest comes amid reports of major successes for the United States in its battle against the Taliban and associated militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan . The leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Hakimullah Mehsud , died recently after reports that a suspected U.S. drone strike targeted him in January , according to Taliban and Pakistani intelligence sources . The previous leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , also died in a suspected U.S. drone strike . CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen called Baradar 's capture a `` huge deal , '' saying he is `` arguably more important than Mullah Omar from a military point of view , because Mullah Omar really is more of a religious figure than an operational commander of the Taliban . '' `` This guy also is the No. 2 political figure in the Taliban . The fact that he was discovered in Karachi is very significant . Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan . It 's a long way from where the war is being fought , '' Bergen said Monday on CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 \u00b0 . '' The capture `` indicates that the Pakistani intelligence services and CIA -LSB- are -RSB- cooperating very closely on a very high-value target . '' A number of high-value targets , including Omar , have moved into Karachi from a region near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , where the Pakistani military and suspected U.S. drones have battled Taliban militants , a senior U.S. official said . Bergen said the operation suggests the Pakistanis are willing to move not only against the Pakistani Taliban but also against the Afghan Taliban , which has its headquarters in Pakistan . Baradar also would have been in regular contact with Omar , Bergen added . Robin Wright , a fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace , called the move a `` huge catch in terms of understanding the organization , '' but she also said the `` Taliban is in many ways a decentralized force , and it 's not necessarily that he is going to be involved in knowing what every single unit on the ground is doing . '' `` The critical issue is how much will he talk and provide information on where other assets are , potentially where the Taliban in Pakistan are , and , of course , the United States would love to know where Osama bin Laden himself is , '' Wright said on `` AC 360 . '' Wright also raised the issue of what will happen to Baradar when the interrogation concludes . `` One of the big questions , of course , is , what are they going to do with him ? '' Wright asked . `` They ca n't take him to Guantanamo Bay . Are the Pakistanis going to prosecute him ? '' According to Interpol , Baradar was born in 1968 in Weetmak village in the Dehrwood District of Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan . Bergen said Baradar and Omar run the Quetta Shura , which operates in southern Afghanistan . `` In terms of the information about the southern Afghanistan operations of the Taliban , this guy is potentially a gold mine , '' Bergen said . `` I suspect he 's not being read his Miranda rights by these Pakistani people who are interrogating him . '' Muhammad Amir Rana , director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies , a Pakistani think tank , called Baradar `` basically the de facto leader '' of the Taliban . `` With Mullah Omar staying out of the scene , Baradar was running the operations of the Taliban . '' Baradar and Omar `` started the Taliban together . He was in the movement since the very beginning , '' Rana said . `` He is a very skilled military tactician . When the Taliban were in government in Afghanistan , he was the supreme commander of the army and was heading the charge against the Northern Alliance holdouts at that point in time . '' Rana said the setback is significant because Baradar was directing the Taliban 's activities in Afghanistan at the time of his arrest . `` His capture would be a severe blow to the Taliban morale at a time when the operation in the Helmand province is under way . '' Rana said Baradar and Afghan President Hamid Karzai hail from the same Popalzai tribe . Karzai has talked about reaching out to some Taliban members , and a Newsweek profile of Baradar last year said that `` Baradar once authorized a Taliban delegation that approached Karzai with a peace offer '' and that he approved peace feelers to Karzai 's brother . Those efforts did n't go anywhere , the magazine said . Reva Bhalla , director of analysis at the Stratfor think tank , said Baradar has been representing Omar at some of the peace talks going on behind the scenes with the Saudis and describes his capture as a big catch . Bhalla said the Pakistanis did n't do this for free ; they want concessions from the United States , and it 's a shift in the strategy on how it 's dealing with the Afghan Taliban in its own territory . The Pakistanis have launched offensives against the Pakistani Taliban , and now the move indicates they might plan to get tough on the Afghan Taliban . `` It 's not like you have one guy , and that immediately opens the door to everyone else . It 's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup . But if the Pakistanis are shifting their mode of cooperation , that is significant .

The killings took place between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning , Gonzalez said . The victims -- all male -- ranged in age between 18 and 25 years old . No other details about the killings or the victims were immediately available . `` This is an indicator of the incrementally increasing war between the two cartels battling for Juarez Plaza , the state 's drug trafficking corridor , '' Gonzalez said , referring to an ongoing battle between the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels for dominance in the area . Juarez Plaza is a major thoroughfare through the area . `` I ca n't give you a reason why the violence is picking up the last week of April going into this month , '' Gonzalez added . Some Mexican news organizations have reported that the Sinaloa Cartel had defeated the rival Juarez organization but Gonzalez said , `` There is no winner to this war . '' The spate of weekend killings followed another bloody week in the Ciudad Juarez area . On Wednesday , at least 15 people were killed in drug-related violence in Juarez , authorities said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Islamist fighters battling for control of Somalia have threatened to close Mogadishu 's only airport , warning all airlines to stop flights into the Somali capital by early Tuesday . African Union peacekeepers keep guard recently at the international airport in Mogadishu , Somalia 's capital . `` Any plane which uses or lands at the airport , we will consider it a military plane and we will not be held responsible for what happens to it , '' the Al-Shaabab militia said in a Web posting . The statement said the airport would be closed at 1 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- 6 p.m. ET Wednesday -RRB- . The statement was posted on www.kataaib.net , a Web site frequently used by Al-Shaabab . A graphic posted along with the statement shows a plane about to land at Mogadishu 's international airport . As the plane approaches , a man with a shoulder-fired missile appears and a red-circle target is placed over the plane . The Somali word for `` Warning ! '' flashes at the same time . Nairobi , Kenya-based Daallo Airlines , which operates flights four times a week into Mogadishu , is `` monitoring the situation , '' the company 's chief executive officer told CNN . `` We have n't received any warning directly , '' Howard Leedham said . He said he was made aware of Al-Shaabab 's warning through the local media , and would not say if any of the four weekly flights would be canceled or rescheduled as a result . `` All I can say is we 're monitoring the situation very closely , '' Leedham said . `` We have employees down there , and so we 're monitoring the situation . '' Maj. Barigye Ba-Hoku , a spokesman for African Union forces in Somalia -- many of whom are based at Mogadishu 's airport -- said he has not received an official warning from Al-Shaabab about the airport 's closure , but `` we take the warning seriously . '' `` We have taken precautionary measures , but that 's all we can do , '' Ba-Hoku told CNN . Al-Shaabab is an Islamic militia that has launched a bloody battle to seize control of Somalia and oust Ethiopian forces , which are helping Somali government forces try to rout the Islamic fighters . It is a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union , which pushed out Somalia 's transitional government in 2006 . The ICU was deposed in December of that year following Ethiopia 's military intervention . In its statement , Al-Shaabab said it has been forced to shut down the airport because it is being used by a variety of `` infidel forces , '' including Ethiopia , Burundi , and Uganda . Burundi and Ugandan forces make up the bulk of the AU mission in Somalia . Al-Shaabab also said U.S. and Israeli security officials `` regularly '' land at the airport . `` So based on all these issues , we -- Al-Shaabab fighters -- are notifying all business people in Mogadishu , particularly to those of the airlines , that the airport is officially closed from the date on 16th September , '' it said .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Dalai Lama , accepting a human rights prize from a U.S. foundation Tuesday , chastised the United States for not fully addressing the economic divide between its poorest and richest citizens . The Dalai Lama sits with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the awards ceremony on Tuesday . `` Huge gap , rich to poor . This is unhealthy , '' he said . `` You have to think seriously about those less-privileged people . They 're also human beings . '' The `` real greatness of America , '' he said , `` is your ancestors ' principles , '' and he urged the nation to preserve those principles . `` When I think of America , I think of the idea -- concept of freedom , liberty , equality . I think these are real human values , '' he said . The inaugural Lantos Human Rights Prize , presented to the 74-year-old Dalai Lama by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , honors his commitment to ending global injustice . The Dalai Lama called the award , from the New Hampshire-based Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice , `` a great privilege , especially because it is named after an individual I admired deeply . '' He was referring to the late Rep. Tom Lantos , D-California , whom the foundation describes as a champion of human rights during his 27 years in Congress . Lantos , who was the only Holocaust survivor in Congress , died of cancer in February 2008 . His image is on the large medal . Before presenting the award , Pelosi said people continue to be inspired by the Dalai Lama 's messages of peace and nonviolence . The medal , the California Democrat said , contains the words `` The rights of one are the rights of all . '' `` The Dalai Lama is one of the most highly honored peacemakers of our time , '' she added . Tuesday 's program focused largely on the work of Lantos , who co-founded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus about 20 years ago . The name of the caucus has been changed to the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission , and part of its mission is to `` promote , defend and advocate internationally recognized human rights norms in a nonpartisan manner , '' according to its Web site . The group is a formal entity of Congress , said Howard Berman , D-California , who was at Tuesday 's event . Also at the ceremony was Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , who called Lantos `` an inspiration . '' `` When he died we lost one of the better angels of our national conscience , '' McCain said . According to the foundation , created by Lantos ' daughter , Katrina Lantos Swett , the Lantos Prize is meant to focus attention on the `` often unsung heroes of the human rights movement . '' The foundation 's Web site says the prize `` will be awarded on an annual basis to the individual or organization that best exemplifies the foundation 's mission , namely , to be a vital voice standing up for the values of decency , dignity , freedom and justice in every corner of the world . '' The Dalai Lama is visiting Washington this week for a conference and to meet with Undersecretary for Global Affairs Maria Otero , who has just been named as President Obama 's special coordinator on Tibet , State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Monday . The Dalai Lama wo n't meet with Obama , who instead plans to visit with him after a presidential trip next month to China , Kelly said . The Dalai Lama and Tibet are dicey issues in Washington , since Beijing considers the Himalayan province a part of China and accuses the spiritual leader of advocating Tibetan independence . The Dalai Lama -- whose name is Tenzin Gyatso -- has repeatedly said he seeks autonomy for the region , not independence , and advocates the `` middle way '' of nonviolence . China has ruled Tibet since 1951 , a year after sending troops to `` liberate '' the region from what it said was serfdom under the Dalai Lama . The Dalai Lama 's emissaries have held sporadic talks with Chinese officials . But the talks , encouraged by the United States and other countries , have failed to break the impasse . In a 2007 trip to Washington , the Dalai Lama met with then-President George W. Bush , who awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal , the nation 's highest civilian honor . Asked whether the lack of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama represents a change in U.S. policy toward China or Tibet , Kelly said , `` I would n't necessarily read ... anything into the decision beyond what it is . '' `` Our position regarding China is clear , that we want to engage China . We think China is an important global player . We also do n't try and downplay some of the concerns that we have about China ... in the areas of human rights , religious freedom , and freedom of expression . '' The Dalai Lama won a Nobel Prize for advocating peace , but he has not been allowed to return to Tibet since fleeing his homeland in 1959 . On Thursday and Friday , he is scheduled to participate in a conference called `` Educating World Citizens for the 21st Century . '' On Saturday he is to spend the morning teaching on `` The Heart of Change : Finding Wisdom in the Modern World , '' an event organized by the Conservancy for Tibetan Art and Culture . He then is slated to return to India before traveling to Japan , Australia and New Zealand .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A male suicide bomber dressed in women 's clothing killed three members of Somalia 's U.N.-backed interim government and 16 others Thursday when he detonated at a medical school graduation ceremony in Mogadishu , government officials and witnesses said . The Transitional Federal Government said Education Minister Abdullahi Wayel , Health Minister Qamar Aden and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were among the dead after the bomber attacked Banadir University 's medical school commencement . The African Union , which leads a peacekeeping mission in Somalia , put the death toll at 19 . The victims also included nine students and two doctors , according to a professor at Banadir University , while journalists said two of their colleagues died in the blast . In addition , Sports Minister Suleman Olad Roble was hospitalized in critical condition , his relatives told local media . Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed blamed the Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab for the attack and displayed what he said was the body of the bomber for reporters , a local journalist who attended the news conference told CNN . The body the president displayed had a beard . The president also showed the remains of the suicide belt and shreds of a hijab -- a garment worn by some Muslim women to reflect modesty -- at the news conference , according to the journalist , whom CNN is not naming for security reasons . At the United Nations , the Security Council condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism against `` people dedicated to building a peaceful , stable and prosperous future for the people of Somalia . '' It urged a `` thorough investigation '' and expressed hope that those responsible would `` be brought swiftly to justice . '' `` The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed and to those injured in the attack , as well as to the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia , '' the council 's current president , Burkina Faso 's U.N. Ambassador Michel Kafando , said Thursday . Video of the graduation ceremony showed Dr. Osman Dufle , the country 's former health minister , speaking as the camera begins to shake -- apparently from the explosion . Afterward , Dufle told journalists that he saw a person dressed in black moving through the audience just before the blast , according to the Radio Mogadishu journalist . Al-Shabaab is made up of former allies of Ahmed , once a leader of the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006 . Adow , a Somali-American , served as the foreign secretary of the Islamic Courts Union when it held Mogadishu . But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N.-brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought , Al-Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against the transitional government . The African Union 's peacekeeping mission AMISOM condemned Thursday 's attack . It vowed to `` spare no efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia '' will be brought to justice . The journalists killed were Mohamed Amiin Abdullah of Shabelle Media Network and freelance cameraman Hassan Ahmed Hagi , who worked closely with the network . CNN regularly works with Shabelle Media . The African Union condemned the attack , saying it would `` spare no efforts to ensure that perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia '' will be brought to justice . The National Union of Somali Journalists also condemned the attack and said it brought the number of journalists killed in the country this year to eight .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In their first head-to-head debate , Sen. John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama as a candidate who `` does n't understand '' the key issues the country faces , and Obama linked McCain to President Bush on several issues . `` I 'm afraid Sen. Obama does n't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy , '' McCain said Friday as the two traded jabs over Iraq . Obama shot back , `` I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy . And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there . '' McCain drew from his experience overseas as he tried to portray himself as the more qualified candidate . `` Incredibly , incredibly Sen. Obama did n't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with Gen. -LSB- David -RSB- Petraeus , '' he said . Watch McCain , Obama talk about fighting in Iraq '' McCain slammed Obama for not supporting the surge , an increase of about 30,000 troops to Iraq in early 2007 . Bush sent the additional troops as part of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces . `` John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 , '' Obama shot back . `` You talk about the surge . The war started in 2003 , and at the time when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy . You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were . You were wrong . '' Watch entire debate : Part 1 '' | Part 2 '' | Part 3 '' Obama repeatedly criticized the Bush administration and charged that McCain is an endorser of his policies . See scenes from the debate '' In describing his tax plan , Obama said , `` over time , that , I think , is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow . '' Obama also said the economic crisis is the `` final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush , supported by Sen. McCain . '' Both candidates squeezed in a few cheap shots . Obama brought up McCain 's jokingly singing a line about bombing Iran , and McCain jabbed Obama for his short-lived `` presidential seal . '' Immediately after the debate , both campaigns issued statements declaring their candidate the winner . Grade the candidates ' performance in the debate `` This was a clear victory for Barack Obama on John McCain 's home turf . Sen. McCain offered nothing but more of the same failed Bush policies , and Barack Obama made a forceful case for change in our economy and our foreign policy , '' said Obama-Biden campaign manager David Plouffe . `` John McCain needed a game-changer tonight , and by any measure , he did n't get it , '' he said . iReport.com : Who do you think won the debate ? McCain 's campaign said `` there was one man who was presidential tonight ; that man was John McCain . '' `` There was another who was political ; that was Barack Obama . John McCain won this debate and controlled the dialogue throughout , whether it was the economy , taxes , spending , Iraq or Iran . There was a leadership gap , a judgment gap and a boldness gap on display tonight , a fact Barack Obama acknowledged when he said John McCain was right at least five times , '' communications director Jill Hazelbaker said . Full coverage of the debates During the first 30 minutes of the debate , the candidates focused on the economy , even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy . For a while , it seemed like the debate might not even take place , because McCain said he would not show up unless Congress came to an agreement on the government 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan . McCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate , even though Congress has not made a deal . Here 's a snapshot of what the candidates said . On government spending : McCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense , veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending . Obama disagreed , saying , `` The problem is , you 're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel . `` There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded , '' Obama said . He agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas , but he said other areas , such as early childhood education , need more funding . McCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks . Watch the candidates spar over earmarks '' Obama said the country `` absolutely '' needs earmark reform but said , `` the fact is , eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track . '' On the bailout proposal : Obama said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . McCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis . Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $ 700 billion plan proposed by President Bush 's top economic advisers , saying the final details of the proposal were not known . McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it . On the likelihood of another terrorist attack : McCain that another attack on the scale of the September 11 hijackings is `` much less likely '' now than it was the day after the terrorist attacks . `` America is safer now than it was on 9\/11 , '' he said , `` But we have a long way to go before we can declare America safe . '' Obama agreed that the United States is `` safer in some ways '' but said the country needed to focus more on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and restoring America 's image in the world . On relations with Russia : Obama called for a re-evaluation of the United States ' approach to Russia in light of the country 's recent military action in the Caucasus . `` You can not be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship , '' he said . McCain accused Obama of responding naively to Russia 's invasion of neighboring Georgia last month by calling on both sides to exercise restraint . McCain said he would support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in NATO . On Iran : McCain said Iranian nuclear weapons would be an `` existential threat to the state of Israel '' and would encourage other countries in the Middle East to seek nuclear weapons as well . `` We can not allow another Holocaust , '' he said . Obama agreed that the United States `` can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , '' calling for tougher sanctions from a range of countries including Russia and China . McCain called for a new `` league of democracies '' to stand firm against Iran . On Iraq : McCain said the next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind . The Republican candidate said that the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning , thanks to a `` great general and a strategy that succeeded . '' `` Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq , '' McCain said . Obama responded , `` that 's not true ; that 's not true . '' He blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start , saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country . Watch Obama tell McCain he was ` wrong ' '' `` At the time when the war started , you said it was quick and easy . You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were , '' Obama said , citing the key White House policy justifying the 2003 invasion . `` You were wrong . You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators . You were wrong , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators discovered four more bodies Tuesday at the Cleveland , Ohio , home of a convicted rapist -- making a total of 10 since last week , Police Chief Michael McGrath said Tuesday . Authorities on Tuesday charged Anthony Sowell with five counts of aggravated murder after unearthing the bodies of women at his home last week , police said . Sowell , 50 , also was charged with rape , felonious assault and kidnapping , police said . His arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday morning . Police arrested Sowell on Saturday , two days after discovering the decomposing bodies of five females inside his home and another woman 's body outside the house . Earlier Tuesday , a source close to the investigation had told CNN that a seventh body had been found in the home . The source , who was not authorized to speak on the record , did not reveal the gender of the seventh body found at Sowell 's home . The source did not say exactly where the body was found at the residence . Authorities found the first two bodies last week while trying to serve an arrest and search warrant on Sowell related to a sexual assault investigation , and an intensive search began . Sowell was not home at the time ; officers found him after a tipster told them of his whereabouts . The decomposing bodies of the first six women , all of whom were African-American , could have been lying where they were found for `` weeks , if not months or years , '' Cuyahoga County Coroner Frank Miller III told CNN on Saturday . All six deaths were ruled homicides , Lt. Thomas Stacho of the Cleveland Police Department said Monday , with five of the deaths due to strangulation . About a month ago , a woman accused Sowell of rape and felonious assault , Stacho noted last week . Investigators obtained the warrants that set off the search after the `` cooperation of the victim , '' he said . Officers serving the warrants Thursday discovered the badly decomposed remains of two bodies on the third floor of the house , he added . A subsequent search revealed what appeared to be a freshly dug grave under the stairs in the basement . On Friday , investigators returned to the house , dug up the grave and found a third body , Stacho said . A further search of the house and property found two more bodies in a crawl space and a sixth body in a shallow grave outside the home . Five different burial methods were used on the victims , and the bodies were in varying states of decomposition , said Miller , which made it difficult to determine the ages of the victims . Stacho said Sowell makes his living as a `` scrapper . '' `` He walks around and picks up scrap metal and takes it to junk yards to make a few pennies , '' he said . Sowell was convicted of a 1989 rape and was imprisoned from 1990 to 2005 , Stacho said . CNN 's Karan Olson contributed to this report .","question":""}

Security Council did not apologize for imposing sanctions on North Korea after it tested a rocket April 5 . The secretive communist state also apparently test-fired a short-range missile Monday , the White House said . The Security Council called on its members to discuss the reported test Monday at 4 p.m. ET . Watch how the test may have taken world by surprise '' The United States and many other countries denounced the test . Even China , North Korea 's strongest ally , said it opposed the test . The White House -- which less than three weeks ago announced a new diplomatic effort to restart stalled talks with North Korea about its nuclear program -- said the test was in `` blatant defiance '' of the Security Council . `` North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community , '' the White House said . `` The danger posed by North Korea 's threatening activities warrants action by the international community . '' While the test was not a surprise , Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said it showed Pyongyang was becoming `` increasingly belligerent . '' North Korea announced its underground nuclear test a little more than an hour after the U.S. Geological Survey reported a magnitude 4.7 seismic disturbance at the site of North Korea 's first nuclear test . There was no immediate information on the yield of the weapon used in Monday 's test . The Russian Defense Ministry said the explosion was between 10 to 20 kilotons . The U.S. State Department said it was analyzing the data . Mullen said it would take a couple of days to verify the reported test , but he added , `` there 's no indication that it was n't as they say . '' The North 's state-run Korean Central News Agency would say only that the latest test was safely conducted `` on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control . '' Watch more analysis on test '' U.S. intelligence estimated the first North Korean test , in October 2006 , produced an explosion equal to less than 1,000 tons of TNT . The low yield was a fraction of the size of the bombs the United States dropped on Japan at the end of World War II . Intelligence analysts had predicted North Korea would conduct a second rocket or nuclear test . The North threatened to do so after the Security Council voted unanimously to condemn its April launch as a violation of a 2006 resolution that bans North Korea 's ballistic missile activity . Watch how Pyongyang has used nuclear tests to gain concessions '' North Korea insisted the rocket was a communications satellite . It retaliated by threatening to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons . The talks -- involving China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States -- are intended to persuade North Korea to scrap its nuclear program . The North also expelled international inspectors from its nuclear sites , announced plans to restart the reactor that produces plutonium for its nuclear weapons , and threatened to launch more rockets and another nuclear device . Monday 's test was conducted `` as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way , '' the North Korean news agency said . `` They think this will enhance and embolden their diplomatic capability to deal with the other countries , '' said Han Sung Joo , former South Korean ambassador to the United States . `` Of course , it may be working the other way . But from their point of view , this is their lifeline , which they want to maintain . '' China 's government `` expresses firm opposition '' to the test , in which North Korea `` disregarded the opposition of the international community , '' according to a statement from China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs . North Korea 's latest move could clear the way for the United States and the other members of the six-party talks , minus North Korea , to impose new punitive measures against a country desperate for food and energy assistance . For now , however , the North 's nuclear arms program is not a major security threat , analysts say . The country has yet to build an effective bomb or develop an effective delivery system to a target country . Watch South Korea 's reaction to the nuclear test '' Last year , North Korea acknowledged producing roughly 88 pounds -LRB- 40 kilograms -RRB- of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs . But analysts say North Korea is years from having a weapon it can put atop a long-range missile like those in the U.S. , Chinese or Russian arsenals . `` I know a lot of people may think , ` Oh no , a nuclear test . Does that mean war , conflict in the Korean Peninsula ? ' '' said Jim Walsh , an international security analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . `` The answer is ` no .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama proposed nearly doubling the child care tax credit for middle-class families Monday , the latest administration initiative meant to reassure Americans nervous about the slow pace of the economic recovery . The proposal is one of five new recommendations from the president 's Middle Class Task Force , which was established one year ago this week . It comes as an increasingly populist White House struggles to regain the political advantage among swing independent voters who have flocked to the GOP in recent elections in Massachusetts , New Jersey and Virginia . `` The middle class has been under assault for a long time , '' Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House . `` None of these steps alone will solve all the challenges facing the middle class , '' he said . `` But hopefully , -LSB- they -RSB- will re-establish some of the security that 's slipped away in recent years . '' Specifically , Obama will push to increase the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit rate from 20 percent to 35 percent for families making under $ 85,000 a year . Families making from $ 85,000 to $ 115,000 also would see an increase in their tax credit , the statement said . At the same time , lower-income families would receive a $ 1.6 billion increase in child care funding , the largest one-year increase in two decades . In addition , the White House will propose limiting federal student loan payments to 10 percent of a student 's income above a basic living allowance . The administration also will push for the creation of a system of automatic workplace individual retirement accounts , requiring all employers to give workers the option of enrolling in a direct-deposit IRA . The `` saver 's tax credit '' would be expanded , with a government match of 50 percent of the first $ 1,000 of contributions for families making $ 65,000 or less . Fourth , the White House will propose expanding tax credits to match retirement savings , while also enacting new safeguards to protect retirement savings . Fifth , the administration will push to expand federal support for families caring for elderly relatives , `` helping them manage their multiple responsibilities and allowing seniors to live in the community for as long as possible , '' a White House official said . Since its establishment , the Middle Class Task Force has held 11 meetings around the country and at the White House , according to the statement . All five task force recommendations will be included in Obama 's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget , which is set to be unveiled February 1 . The president is also widely expected to stress middle-class economic themes in Wednesday 's State of the Union address . CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky has won his libel case against a Russian broadcaster in a London court , his spokeswoman told CNN Wednesday . The tycoon , who now lives in exile in Britain , was disputing a 2007 report by the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company -LRB- VGTRK -RRB- , which claimed Berezovsky was behind the 2006 poisoning death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko . The High Court in London awarded Berezovsky # 150,000 -LRB- $ 223,400 -RRB- in damages , according to Berezovsky 's spokeswoman , Jennifer Morgan . `` I have no doubt that , in making this program , the purpose of RTR and the Russian authorities was to undermine my asylum status in the U.K. and to put the investigation of -LRB- Alexander -RRB- Litvinenko 's murder on the wrong track , '' Berezovsky said in a statement . `` I am pleased that the court , through its judgment , has unequivocally demolished RTR 's claims . '' RTR is the company 's satellite channel . The judgment was issued in London because RTR broadcasts to Britain . In addition to VGTRK , a Russian man , Vladimir Terluk , was also found liable for the damages because the judge found he had made the claim in RTR 's report . VGTRK will not accept the ruling , company lawyer Zoya Matveyevskaya told the state-run RIA-Novosti news service . The broadcaster had previously said it would not recognize any court rulings in this case and would appeal to the European Court , saying the London court process was `` biased '' and `` politically tinted , '' RIA-Novosti reported . The High Court had demanded that VGTRK reveal its information sources , and after the TV company refused , the court banned the broadcaster from taking part in the court process , RIA-Novosti reported . Litvinenko was a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle blower on the FSB , the KGB 's successor . He claimed he had been ordered to assassinate Berezovsky . Like other dissidents in London , Litvinenko was a vehement critic of then-President Vladimir Putin and vocal about Chechen politics . He wrote a book in which he claimed FSB agents , and not Chechen rebels , carried out a series of bombings at Moscow apartment buildings and a mall in 1999 that killed 300 people . Litvinenko died at a London hospital November 23 , 2006 , from a massive dose of the radioactive material polonium-210 . In a deathbed statement he blamed Putin for his death , something the Kremlin has strongly denied . Berezovsky sued over allegations that he was involved in Litvinenko 's death , which were broadcast April 1 , 2007 , on RTR 's news program Vesti Nedeli , or News of the Week . The program featured an interview with a man named Pyotr , who made the claim . Pyotr 's identity was disguised , but the High Court judge found he was in fact Terluk , who has lived in Britain since 1999 . Berezovsky made his money during the years that Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia by taking control of many state assets , from oil and car companies to property . He was part of the Yeltsin inner circle and led an extravagant lifestyle immortalized in the film , `` Oligarch . '' But when Putin came to power , Berezovsky fell out of favor and found his business activities under scrutiny . He fled to Britain in 2000 and was granted political asylum in 2003 . He also saw the demise of his media ambitions after his stake in Russia 's major television company ORT was sold , and his own TV6 channel was closed down . Berezovsky and Litvinenko came to know each other in the aftermath of a failed assassination attempt on the oligarch in 1994 . The pair maintained contact once in Britain .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn , one automaker announced Thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the United States , potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen . Tesla unveils its Model S sedan , with a base price of $ 57,400 . The manufacturing plant will be in California . Tesla Motors , maker of a high-end electric sports car , says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California . Thursday 's announcement was made in Hawthorne , California , where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $ 49,900 , after a federal tax credit of $ 7,500 . That 's less than half the price of its first model , the Roadster . Started in 2003 and bankrolled by PayPal millionaire Elon Musk , Tesla has attracted investments from the Silicon Valley elite , among them Google founder Larry Page . It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne . That aerospace company , more commonly known as SpaceX , was founded by Musk in 2002 . SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year . That contract , worth $ 1.6 billion , was won over such industry mainstays as Boeing and Lockheed . The promise of a high-performance , all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup 's first model , the Tesla Roadster , a car with the look , speed and price tag -- a steep $ 109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end , high-performance vehicles . Recently though , the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011 . They 've also had to lay off more than 80 workers , which is about 25 percent of the company 's staff . Nonetheless , Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year . That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster ; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly . The company faces many challenges , the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $ 50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A public memorial service for heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio is planned for Sunday , with members of the Westboro Baptist Church saying they will picket the ceremony . The church in Topeka , Kansas , is known for its intolerance of gays and its picketing of soldiers ' funerals . A picketing schedule on the church 's website said protesters will be at the Dio memorial at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles , accusing the 67-year-old rocker of worshipping Satan . Dio died on May 16 after a battle with stomach cancer . Charges of devil-worshipping have often been leveled against heavy metal music . Dio , in particular , was a favorite target . He popularized the `` devil 's horn '' gesture , where the index and the little fingers are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers . He has said he was taught by the sign by his superstitious Italian grandmother as a way to ward off the `` evil eye . '' But many fundamentalist Christians have taken issue with the gesture , alleging that it is a tribute to the devil . `` Ronnie hates prejudice and violence . We need to turn the other cheek on these people that only know how to hate someone they did n't know , '' said Dio 's wife , Wendy , about the planned protest . Wendy Dio said the memorial will host a donation center for her husband 's `` Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund , '' named after one his songs . Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell , a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons . All shows were canceled last March because of his illness . His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards , when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year 's Heaven and Hell album . Dio appeared frail , but he spoke while accepting his award . Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942 , Dio 's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s . His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s , when the group played heavy blues rock . Dio 's rock became darker with his band Rainbow , which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath . Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio , including `` Heaven and Hell '' in 1980 , `` Mob Rules '' in 1981 and `` Live Evil '' in 1982 . Dio left that band in 1982 , but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later . He formed the group Dio in 1982 and later Heaven and Hell .","question":""}
{"answer":"COLOMBO , Sri Lanka -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five members of the Sri Lanka 's Civil Defense Force -LRB- CDF -RRB- were killed in a suicide blast in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning , police said . Sri Lankan police officers investigate Sunday 's suicide bombing near Colombo . Eight other CDF officers and two civilians were wounded , police said . Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast , but police suspect the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels . There was no immediate response from the Tamil Tiger rebels to the incident , which , police said , occurred at St. Anne 's Church in the Colombo suburb of Wattala , located on a roadway to the country 's only international airport about 15 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- north of the capital . The attack happened during a weekly festival that usually draws a large crowd shopping for vegetables and household goods . The suicide bomber walked into an area where CDF officers were stationed and detonated his explosives , police said . Investigators suspect the bomber targeted the area because 150 police officers who help patrol the road to the airport are billeted there . Government forces have engaged rebels in heavy fighting for more than a year in the Kilinochchi region , once the center of political power for the Tamil Tigers . The 25-year civil war between ethnic Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government has left more than 65,000 people dead . The Tamil Tigers were founded in 1976 , and the U.S. State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997 . The rebels , formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- , are fighting for the creation of an independent nation , citing discrimination by the country 's Sinhalese majority . Earlier Sunday , Sri Lanka 's navy said it had destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel boat allegedly attempting to smuggle in military supplies through the northern coast . Commander D.K.P. Dissanayake , a navy spokesman , told CNN that four rebels were killed in attack after the boat was engulfed in fire . He said the incident occurred just after midnight Sunday but gave no other details . There was no immediate response from the Tiger rebels to that incident . CNN could not independently verify the government 's claim because media is debarred from Sri Lanka 's battle zones . In the past , both sides in the conflict have exaggerated accounts of military operations . On December 20 , the Navy said it destroyed a similar rebel boat trying to smuggle military supplies through the coast near the northeastern coastal village of Mullaitivu . However , a second supply boat was caught on Air Force aerial surveillance cameras unloading along the coast . `` They included assorted ammunition , artillery shells , mortar shells and other items , '' a senior Air Force official told CNN . He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Republican Sen . Ted Stevens of Alaska has been `` cleared '' by the Justice Department 's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him , his lawyer said Wednesday . Former Sen. Ted Stevens , 85 , of Alaska lost his re-election bid in November . Prosecutors accused Stevens of failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of `` freebies '' from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms . But in December , an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense , and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday . `` His name is cleared , '' Stevens ' lawyer , Brendan Sullivan , told reporters . `` He is innocent of the charges , as if they 'd never been brought . '' Stevens , 85 , lost his bid for a seventh full term in November after his conviction on seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms . Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of `` extraordinary evidence of government corruption . '' Watch more on the dismissal of the case '' `` Not only did the government fail to provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide , but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom , '' he said . And one of Stevens ' longtime friends , Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch , said Wednesday that Stevens was `` screwed by our own Justice Department . '' In a statement issued Wednesday morning , Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped . `` I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed , '' Stevens said . `` That day has finally come . '' U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department 's request to dismiss the case . Sullivan , who is not related to Stevens ' lawyer , excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point . In December , two months after the guilty verdicts , the FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen , an oil industry executive who was the government 's key witness . In the motion it filed Wednesday , the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen , the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska . The notes show that responses by Allen , the prosecution 's star witness , were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens , and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial , the motion says . `` In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial , '' Holder said in a written statement . Hatch , a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded `` elated , as anyone would . '' `` Here 's a guy who gave better than 60 years ' service to the country and was screwed -- screwed by our own Justice Department , '' Hatch said . But he praised Holder for `` standing up and fixing this foul situation . '' `` I think he 's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter , and it 's not an easy thing for him to do that , '' Hatch said . `` He has , in looking at it , realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right . '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , also commented on the Justice Department 's request , saying , `` Ted Stevens is 85 years old . He 's already been punished enough . I 'm satisfied . '' And in a statement Wednesday , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Stevens `` deserves to be very happy today . What a horrible thing he has endured . The blatant attempts by adversaries to destroy one 's reputation , career and finances are an abuse of our well-guarded process and violate our God-given rights afforded in the Constitution . `` It is a frightening thing to contemplate what we may be witnessing here -- the undermining of the political process through unscrupulous ploys and professional misconduct . Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope . It is unfortunate that , as a result of the questionable proceedings which led to Senator Stevens ' conviction days before the election , Alaskans lost an esteemed statesman on Capitol Hill . His presence is missed . '' The Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team 's conduct in Stevens ' case , Holder said . Asked whether the prosecutors should be charged themselves , Sullivan told reporters , `` That is not my job . I 'm a defense lawyer . '' During the trial , Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid `` hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies '' he received from Allen 's company , VECO , and from Allen himself . Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens ' Alaska home , prosecutors said . CNN 's Terry Frieden , Paul Courson , Ted Barrett and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Adults who were exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke during childhood have lungs that look different on CT scans from those of people who grew up in a smoke-free environment , a new study suggests . The harmful short-term effects of secondhand smoke are well known ; the long-term consequences are n't as clear . Specifically , their lungs have slightly more , and larger , emphysema-like `` holes '' than those with less smoke exposure , says Gina Lovasi , M.P.H. , Ph.D. , of Columbia University , and her colleagues . Although breathing tests showed that the smoke-exposed lungs were functioning just fine , Lovasi said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road . Health.com : Should smoking around kids be illegal ? Emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath , coughing , fatigue , and weight loss . About 24 million people in the United States have emphysema and\/or chronic bronchitis , which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -LRB- COPD -RRB- ; however about half of those people do n't realize they have COPD . The lung condition is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States , and smoking is a major cause of COPD . Health.com : I 'm a nonsmoker , but I have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition `` The interesting part about this is that we do n't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco , '' says Lovasi , who is scheduled to present her findings on Tuesday at the American Thoracic Society 's 105th International Conference in San Diego . `` We can still see a difference even decades later . '' The harmful short-term effects of breathing other people 's cigarette smoke are well known , but the long-term consequences are n't as clear .

'' For people who had n't grown up with smokers , 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air-like density , while `` holes '' made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood . The more heavily smoke-exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs .

But `` choosing life was the right road . '' Palin said national media coverage of the pregnancy `` kind of made it rough '' on Bristol and sent a not-too-subtle message to other young women that it 's easier to choose to have an abortion . Turning to other policy disputes , Palin also slammed the Obama administration 's fiscal program , declaring that `` these policies coming out of D.C. right now '' are putting the country on the road to `` national insolvency .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama mentioned an $ 8 billion investment in high-speed train systems across the country in his State of the Union speech on Wednesday . Details released Thursday said the investment would be grants from the government 's $ 862 billion economic stimulus package to begin the planning and initial work on creating the first nationwide program of high-speed intercity passenger rail service . Overall , projects and planning involving the rail corridors will take place in 31 states , according to a White House statement . Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were scheduled to travel to Tampa , Florida , Thursday to formally announce the program . Other Cabinet members and administration officials also were visiting sites of the program in other states on Thursday and Friday . According to the statement , the corridor between Tampa and Orlando , Florida , would have trains capable of traveling up to 168 mph with 16 round trips a day . The time to travel by train between the cities would be about an hour , compared with about 90 minutes by car , it said . `` This project will create jobs and generate economic activity as 84 miles of track are constructed , stations are built or enhanced , and equipment is purchased , '' with work expected to be completed in 2014 , the statement said . `` The projects announced today are part of President Obama 's strategic long-term plan to transform travel in America by building and sustaining a comprehensive passenger rail program , '' the statement said . `` In addition to the $ 8 billion awarded today , the plan also included $ 1 billion a year for five years in the federal budget as a down payment to jump-start the program .

Watch new suicide tactics in Iraq '' Four U.S. soldiers died at the scene Monday 's Baghdad blast and one more died later of wounds , the military said . They were with Multi-National Division-Baghdad . An Iraqi interpreter also was wounded in the explosion , the officials said . Initial reports indicate the bomber was wearing an explosive vest . `` Five soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Iraqi and American people . I ask you remember these fallen heroes and their families as well as their wounded brethren in your thoughts and prayers , '' said Col. Allen Batschelet , chief of staff for Multi-National Division-Baghdad . `` We remain resolute in our resolve to protect the people of Iraq and kill or capture those who would bring them harm . '' The explosion marks the deadliest attack against the U.S. military since five soldiers were killed January 28 in a roadside bombing in Mosul . Troops killed a Saudi insurgent whose network was responsible for that attack . Earlier , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said one person was killed and eight people were wounded in a suicide bomb attack targeting a U.S. military convoy in western Baghdad . It is not clear if the U.S. and Iraqi reports are about the same incident . Monday 's attacks would bring the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq this month to 10 . A total of 3,983 military personnel have died in the nearly 5-year-old war . The attack came after a bomber near Baquba targeted the leader of a security group assisting U.S. troops . The teen suicide bomber killed a sheik and a 5-year-old , a day after she went to the sheik 's Kanan home claiming to need help finding her husband , police and family members said . The female suicide bomber , 18 , blew herself up at the sheik 's home Monday morning , police said . The tribal leader was the head of a local citizens group that has been working with U.S. forces to rout out insurgents . The largely Sunni security groups are known as Awakening Councils . Kanan is east of Baquba , situated in the volatile Diyala province , which has been a major front for the `` surge '' of U.S.-led troops targeting militants near Baghdad . According to one of the sheik 's cousins , the teen bomber went to the sheik 's house Sunday to ask him for help finding her husband -- thought to be kidnapped or detained . The 18-year-old was told to return Monday , the cousin said . She returned Monday and staged the attack , killing the sheik , his 5-year-old niece and one of his security guards , police said . The attack reflects both the growing use of females as suicide bombers in Iraq and the targeting of Awakening Councils , which are also known as Concerned Citizens Groups or Sons of Iraq . The grass-roots groups , which are sometimes led by former insurgents , have drawn more than 90,000 volunteers to their ranks , military spokesman Rear Adm. Gregory said Sunday . Since November , there have been at least five attacks carried out by female suicide bombers , including a twin bombing at Baghdad pet markets last month that killed almost 100 people . Insurgent groups , particularly al Qaeda in Iraq , are increasingly using women as suicide bombers because they are less likely to be searched , the U.S. military has said . About an hour after the attack at the sheik 's home , another suicide bomber approached Iraqi security forces in Muqdadiya and blew himself up as the forces began shooting at him . The blast killed two civilians and wounded 20 others , including two police officers , authorities said . Muqdadiya also is in Diyala province . In other developments : \u2022 A suicide car bomb exploded Monday outside an upscale hotel in Sulaimaniya , killing two people and wounding at least 32 others , police said . The blast occurred at the Sulaimani Palace hotel , located in the center of the city . It is in northern Iraq 's Kurdish region and is a common stop for visiting government officials , businessmen and contractors . \u2022 Two bombings in Baghdad on Monday killed an Iraqi and wounded nine others , an Interior Ministry official said . A parked car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in Shaab , a Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad , killing a civilian and wounding seven others . A roadside bomb exploded on a highway near a U.S. military patrol in eastern Baghdad , wounding two bystanders . \u2022 Coalition troops north of Baghdad killed five insurgents and detained 19 people in raids , the U.S. military said Monday . The Sunday raids were part of coalition forces ' `` untiring efforts to remove al Qaeda from Iraq , '' said Lt. Col. Maura Gillen , a Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokeswoman . \u2022 Several U.S. troops may have been sickened by dirty water intended for hygiene use and supplied to bases around Iraq between 2004 and 2006 , according to a Pentagon report released Monday . However , the Department of Defense inspector general 's report points out that because the water was not monitored , it is impossible to tell for sure if it was dirty and if it contributed to the troops getting sick .

{"answer":"SATSUMA , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of a missing 5-year-old Florida girl made a renewed plea Thursday for the return of his daughter . The search continued Thursday for Haleigh Cummings , 5 , who went missing from her home near Orlando . `` If you have my daughter and you 're watching this , drop her off somewhere safe , '' Roland Cummings said of his daughter Haleigh . `` I 'm not out for revenge , I 'm not out for nothing else . I want my daughter back , '' Cummings said , with his girlfriend , Misty Croslin , at his side . He said he could think of no reason Haleigh would be taken . `` Why would anybody be sick enough '' to abduct a child ? he asked . Cummings , 25 , said earlier that he and Croslin had passed lie detector tests . Croslin , 17 , was the last person to see Haleigh when she put the girl to bed Monday night in their Satsuma , Florida , home . She said she awoke in the middle of the night to find Haleigh gone and the back door to the double-wide trailer propped open with a brick . Putnam County authorities on Thursday continued working with the FBI and state investigators to search a five-mile area for Haleigh . Police have no official suspects , but say they are treating everyone they interview as one . `` All the world 's a suspect '' now , a sheriff 's spokesman has said . Cummings said earlier that he was surprised when he arrived home from work at 3 a.m. Tuesday to see his girlfriend awake , and he asked her why she was up . `` She said , ` Your back door 's open and your daughter 's gone , ' '' Cummings told Nancy Grace on her show on CNN 's sister network HLN on Wednesday night . Watch Cummings describe his shock '' Croslin waited until Cummings came home to phone 911 about the girl 's disappearance , though it 's unclear how long that wait was . Watch the father describe what happened '' Police said Wednesday that Croslin had tucked the girl and her 4-year-old brother into bed at 8 p.m. before going to sleep at 10 . Croslin told police she woke up around 3 a.m. to use the bathroom and returned to find the girl missing . The boy was still in bed , Cummings told CNN . A brick was propping the trailer 's door open , Croslin told a 911 dispatcher . Hear the frantic 911 call '' The father said he has used the back door only two times since he 's been living in the trailer . Police say they believe the girl was abducted . `` There 's no longer any reason to believe that the child simply wandered outside , '' Maj. Gary Bowling of the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office said Wednesday . The police must `` assume abduction , '' he said , adding , `` All the answers to why you 'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly . '' Haleigh 's mother , Crystal Sheffield , shook as she spoke Thursday near the search area . Sheffield 's mother , Marie Griffis , said that she and her daughter are devastated . `` It 's like I 've got a hole in my body , and she feels helpless because she ca n't do anything but sit here . '' A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear . Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues , said Bowling , describing the girlfriend as a `` child herself . '' Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a `` rocky relationship '' and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter . Watch mother 's tearful plea '' It 's unclear if Sheffield and Cummings were ever married , but they are `` legally separated , '' police said Thursday . Authorities were unable to answer media questions about how and why Cummings had custody of Haleigh . Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement , according to police . Investigators are looking into various angles of the case , including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home , said Lt. Johnny Greenwood of the Putnam County Sheriff 's Office . Police are offering but not requiring all those interviewed in the case to take polygraph tests . A familiar face from the Caylee Anthony case is involved in the search . Bounty hunter Leonard Padilla joined the hunt Tuesday and is offering a $ 25,000 reward for the girl 's return . Padilla initially bonded out Caylee 's mother , Casey , who has been charged with first-degree murder in the toddler 's death , and then helped launch one of several searches for Caylee .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For years , Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants , officials say . On Thursday , Bout and his associate , Andrew Smulian , were arrested in Thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel . The men 's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries , including two undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration posing as Colombian rebels . Bout and Smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to Colombian rebels , said Michael Garcia , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York . In a complaint filed by a DEA agent , they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC . The U.S. Department of State designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003 . `` This marks the end of the reign of one of the world 's most-wanted arms traffickers , '' Garcia said of Bout . `` Someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday , and I can tell you that it will read like the very best work of Tom Clancy , only in this case , it wo n't be fiction , '' said Michael Braun , assistant administrator and chief of operations for the DEA . Secret meetings The operation began in January , when Smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent FARC but who were actually confidential sources working for the DEA . The men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons . At meetings in the Netherlands Antilles , Denmark and Romania , Smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents . At one meeting , the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about Bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers . Smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into Colombia , and he told the men that it would cost $ 5 million to transport the weapons . During one meeting , Smulian introduced the DEA sources to Bout over the phone . After that conversation , Smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in Bulgaria . Smulian and Bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal , and that is what happened Thursday . The arrests were made Thursday afternoon . The charges against Bout and Smulian cover the period from November through February , according to a written statement from the U.S. attorney 's office and the DEA . The United States plans to pursue the extradition of Bout from Thailand , the statement said . There was no mention of Smulian 's fate . Bout and Smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . If convicted , each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison , the statement said . ` I 'm not a diamond guy ' Intelligence agencies around the world have tracked Bout for years . Although some of his work has been legitimate , most has not . He has made deliveries to Africa , Asia and the Mideast using obsolete or surplus Soviet-era cargo planes . Bout , a former Soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages , has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of Soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world , according to U.S. officials . He acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union , the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in 2005 . At that time , the U.S. Treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of Bout and his associates , who are all tied to former Liberian President Charles Taylor . Taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the Special Court for Sierra Leone . Intelligence officials said Bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across Africa and Asia , often taking diamonds in payment from West African fighters . A 2006 article in Foreign Policy magazine said that although Bout served many third-world leaders , he also aided organizations such as the United Nations . `` He made countless trips for the United Nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place , '' the article charged . It said Bout probably committed multiple violations of U.N. arms embargoes . British intelligence officials found evidence in Afghanistan that Bout had shipped arms to the Taliban and al Qaeda , as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into Iraq . And the U.S. government said it received information that Bout profited $ 50 million from supplying the Taliban with military equipment when they ruled Afghanistan . Bout , who is said to be the inspiration for Nicolas Cage 's arms dealer character in the movie `` Lord of War , '' told CNN in 2002 that he never sold arms to the Taliban or al Qaeda . He also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to Iraq . Bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to Africa and to Afghanistan since 1992 . He denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in `` blood diamonds '' from Africa . `` It 's a lie , '' he said . `` I never touched diamonds in my life , and I 'm not a diamond guy , and I do n't want to go into that business . '' Some reports at the time claimed that Bout flew into Afghanistan just before September 11 , 2001 . But Bout told CNN that the last time he was in Afghanistan was 1996 and that he never met terror mastermind Osama bin Laden . E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators continued their search Tuesday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma . `` We 've got to find that little girl , '' Special Agent Ray Homer of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said . `` We 're doing what we can . '' The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo , Oklahoma , late Sunday , the bureau said . Her 37-year-old mother , Tonya Hobbs , was found dead inside a parked RV . They also are trying to find the dead woman 's estranged husband , Lester William Hobbs , 46 , the bureau has said . Lester Hobbs and Aja are presumed to be in Hobbs ' car -- a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag No. 577-BPW , police said . Police were looking for Hobbs and Aja in Oklahoma and Texas . Authorities were working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on Tuesday to set up a toll-free phone line and put Aja 's photo on a Web site of missing children , Homer said . They have had no communication with Lester Hobbs or anyone else that would indicate Aja 's location , he said . Tonya Hobbs and her daughter visited Lester Hobbs at his sister 's home , the bureau said . Lester Hobbs is not Aja 's biological father , police said . Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert , Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said . Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport , Texas , and the alert was issued preemptively , she said . Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night . Authorities did not say how Hobbs died , but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her . The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs and was parked at his relatives ' home , Richard Goss , agent in charge of the bureau 's Lawton , Oklahoma , office , told reporters . Hobbs ' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tonya Hobbs or Aja . One of them pried open the RV door and discovered Tonya Hobbs ' body , he said . Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone , Goss said . The Hobbses were separated , but apparently Tonya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile , Goss said . The couple had been together for about five years . The Comanche County , Oklahoma , Sheriff 's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication . `` Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl , '' Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters . `` We know that she does need some medication , '' and authorities were checking leads regarding that , he said . He did not specify Aja 's medical condition . Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history , but did not elaborate . The sheriff 's office said he had prior felony convictions . Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County , Oklahoma , on a DUI charge , Goss said , and did not appear , so a warrant has been issued for him . Aja 's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November , according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City . At a hearing , Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl 's father , John Johnson , agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs , the documents said . Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds , Goss said . She has brown eyes , and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black . Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds , with hazel eyes and brown hair , according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation . The agency released a picture of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a goatee . Geronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton , Oklahoma , in the south-central part of the state .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Owning a professional sports franchise is my dream job . -LRB- I 'm willing to relocate . -RRB- Of course , I could never afford my own team . There 's a better chance I 'll miraculously develop an unhittable slider , or learn to punt . NFL team owner Robert Kraft got his start in the paper business . You obviously must be exceedingly wealthy to become an owner . Did you ever wonder how all these people made all that money ? I sure hope you did , because we went and did all this research . Here 's a list of nine billionaire owners and how they built their fortunes . 1 . Rich DeVos , Orlando Magic -LRB- NBA -RRB- In 1959 , DeVos and high school friend Jay Van Andel started selling all-purpose cleaner . Their business grew to become Amway , which now brings in $ 6 billion each year under the ominous-sounding Alticor name . Whether you see Amway as an empowering direct sales company or a something resembling a cult , it sure was good to DeVos . Forbes estimates his wealth at $ 3.5 billion , making the paltry $ 85 million he spent on the Magic in 1991 a minor investment . 2 . Robert L. Johnson , Charlotte Bobcats -LRB- NBA -RRB- Lower on my list of dream jobs is running a cable network that caters to urban youth . So I 'm all kinds of envious of Robert L. , who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $ 3 billion in 2001 . His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce , but Johnson 's estimated net worth is still $ 1.1 billion . His resume is full of firsts BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE . He was the first African-American billionaire in the U.S. And , in 2002 , he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise . 3 . Robert Kraft , New England Patriots -LRB- NFL -RRB- I 'd never given it much thought , but I 'd always assumed Kraft bought the Patriots with big cheese money he 'd inherited . But Kraft got his start in the paper business . His wife , Myra , is the daughter of Massachusetts philanthropist Jacob Hiatt . After Kraft finished Harvard Business School , he went to work with his father-in-law 's packaging company . In 1972 , Kraft founded International Forest Products , which is now part of the Kraft Group -- a diversified collection of companies ranging from Gillette Stadium to the New England Revolution -LRB- Major League Soccer -RRB- to Carmel Container Systems -LRB- Israel 's largest packaging plant -RRB- . Kraft is seen as a savior in New England -- before he bought the team in 1994 , the Pats seemed destined for relocation to St. Louis . Plus he 's made them really , really good , winning three Super Bowls this decade . Another reason I 'm so keen on owning a team is the access to foreign heads of state . In 2005 , Kraft met Vladimir Putin , who walked off with one of Kraft 's Super Bowl rings . Kraft now claims it was a gift , but that might just be what you say when a Russian leader steals your jewelry . Mental Floss : How ex-presidents and prime ministers make ends meet 4 . Hiroshi Yamauchi , Seattle Mariners -LRB- MLB -RRB- Despite America 's strong resistance to Japanese ownership -- and despite his admitted lack of interest in baseball -- Hiroshi Yamauchi became majority owner of the Seattle Mariners in 1992 . Yamauchi is the man credited with transforming Nintendo from playing-card company to video game giant . His 55-year tenure saw incredible growth . But that does n't mean there were n't a few bumps along the way . Forays into instant rice , taxi service and short-stay hotels -LRB- also known as `` love hotels '' -RRB- did not pan out . 5 . Jerry Jones , Dallas Cowboys -LRB- NFL -RRB- Jerry Jones built an oil empire in the early 1970s , striking gas in the first thirteen wells he drilled . His father had given him a head start ; Pat Jones sold the Modern Security Life Insurance Company for millions . An undersized guard , Jones was captain of the 1965 Cotton Bowl-winning Arkansas Razorbacks . Future Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson was a teammate , and Johnson 's successor , Barry Switzer , was a Razorbacks assistant . Jones bought the Cowboys for an estimated $ 140 million in 1989 . He immediately made waves by firing Tom Landry -- the only coach in Cowboys history -- and replacing him with his college buddy -LRB- the aforementioned Jimmy Johnson , who was coaching the University of Miami -RRB- . After a rocky 1-15 start in 1989 , the Cowboys went on to win three Super Bowls in the 1990s . Mental Floss : A brief history of stadium naming rights 6 . Malcolm Glazer , Tampa Bay Buccaneers -LRB- NFL -RRB- , Manchester United -LRB- English Premier League -RRB- Malcolm Glazer inherited a small jewelry repair business from his father . But it was Malcolm 's investments in Florida trailer parks that started his financial ascent . He went on to become president and CEO of First Allied Corporation , which now owns 6,700,000 square feet of retail space . He was also chairman of Gilbert\/Robinson , Inc. , which managed over 100 restaurants , including Houlihan 's and Darryl 's . Today , the Glazer family oversees strip malls and nursing homes throughout the land . Glazer also has a large stake in Zapata , an oil company founded by George H.W. Bush . Glazer made five previous attempts to join the elite ranks of NFL ownership , including a failed 1993 bid to bring an expansion team to Baltimore . The New York Times said Glazer had `` a reputation as a franchise window shopper , one who looks at virtually every team that comes up for sale . '' But in 1995 , he outbid George Steinbrenner for the downtrodden Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Under his leadership , the franchise was righted , earning a Super Bowl title in 2003 . Glazer also bought Manchester United , and fans were n't exactly pleased . 7 . Stanley Kroenke , Denver Nuggets -LRB- NBA -RRB- , Colorado Avalanche -LRB- NHL -RRB- , St. Louis Rams -LRB- NFL -- partial owner -RRB- Kroenke is a self-made man who also married mega-rich . He earned his estimated $ 2.1 billion fortune in real estate , developing shopping centers across the country . Then he went ahead and married a Walton -- Ann Walton . Sam 's niece . She 's worth another $ 3 + billion . A sports junkie , Kroenke also owns Major League Soccer franchise Colorado Rapids and a share in Premier League 's Arsenal F.C. 8 . Daniel Gilbert , Cleveland Cavaliers -LRB- NBA -RRB- With $ 5,000 he 'd earned delivering pizzas -- and after a stint as a TV reporter -- the future Cavs owner started a small mortgage company called Rock Financial in 1985 . In 1999 , the company was bought by Intuit for $ 532 million . Three years later , Gilbert bought it back for $ 64 mil , renaming the company Quicken Loans . He purchased the Cavaliers for $ 375 mil in 2005 . He also owns Fathead , which makes wall decals and tiresome ads . On the side , Gilbert is working to beat Michigan 's steroid-free bench-pressing record . 9 . Stephen Bisciotti , Baltimore Ravens -LRB- NFL -RRB- At 48 , Stephen Bisciotti is one of the NFL 's youngest owners .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama has been charged with piracy , a count that carries a minimum life sentence . Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrives in the United States on Monday . He was charged with piracy Tuesday . Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse also has been charged with conspiracy to seize a ship by force , conspiracy to commit hostage-taking and two firearm charges , according to a criminal complaint released by the U.S. attorney 's office in the southern district of New York . Muse `` conducted himself as the leader '' of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama , according to the criminal complaint . A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Muse could be tried as an adult . U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck had ordered the media and public out of the courtroom earlier while he evaluated Muse 's age . Muse 's father in Somalia told defense attorneys the young man was born on November 20 , 1993 -- making him 15 , the defense attorneys said . However , the prosecution argued otherwise , saying Muse made statements that suggest he is older . Before Peck closed the courtroom , Muse wiped his hand over his face at one point , and it appeared he was crying . He had worn a broad smile late Monday when he arrived in New York escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers . See timeline of events that led to piracy case '' Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama , a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast . See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa '' Peck read the young man his rights and said attorneys had been appointed to represent him because the suspect did not have the resources to hire representation himself . Muse said through an interpreter that he understood and said , `` I do n't have any money . '' Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama , a cargo ship , on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast . According to the criminal complaint , two of the 20 crew members -- all Americans -- saw lights heading toward the Maersk Alabama around 4:30 a.m. on April 8 , while the ship was in the Indian Ocean . After a `` brief time , '' the lights disappeared , the complaint said , but about two hours later , the same crew members saw a small boat approaching and later heard `` what sounded like '' gunshots , the complaint said . Crew Member 1 then heard the ship 's captain -- later identified as Capt. Richard Phillips -- on the radio saying that two pirates were on the ship 's bridge . A third crew member , Crew Member 3 , also heard the radio message and began shutting down the ship 's power , the complaint said . The complaint said Muse , who was carrying a gun , was the first alleged pirate on the ship , and said the attackers used a portable ladder to climb on board . According to the complaint , Muse had fired his gun at Phillips , the captain said , and then took $ 30,000 from the ship 's safe after he forced Phillips to open it . Watch Muse being hauled into court '' Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship 's owner , the complaint said . The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so , the complaint said , citing Crew Member 2 . Muse then began canvassing the dark ship with Crew Member 2 as a guide , the complaint said . While they were going through the ship , Crew Member 3 , who had not come to the bridge , tackled Muse to the ground , the complaint said . Crew Member 2 helped subdue Muse , and the two tied the young man 's hands with wire and took him to the ship 's safe room , where several crew members were hiding . After several hours , the remaining pirates said they would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them , and if a lifeboat was given to them . Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship 's crew freed Muse , who then boarded the lifeboat , according to the criminal complaint . The boat floated a short distance from the Maersk , even as the Navy 's USS Bainbridge arrived the next day . Over the next three days , officers on the Bainbridge communicated with the pirates by radio . `` In those communications , the pirates threatened to kill the captain if they were not provided with safe passage away from the scene , '' the complaint said . At one point , Phillips tried to escape and the pirates shot at him , the complaint said . On April 12 , Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips ' release . Muse also received medical treatment while he was on the warship , the complaint said . While Muse was away from the lifeboat , Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates . The U.S. Navy recovered two loaded AK-47 assault rifles ; two gunstraps , each containing three AK-47 magazines ; one handgun magazine ; and multiple cell phones and handheld radios from the lifeboat , according to the complaint .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four senators pushed for a bill Wednesday to ban texting while driving , a day after a study found that drivers who text while on the road are much more likely to have an accident than undistracted drivers . A law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving . Sens. Chuck Schumer , D-New York ; Robert Menendez , D-New Jersey ; Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan , D-North Carolina , unveiled the ALERT Act , which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving . The proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle , said an earlier news release from the senators . If the bill passes , the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance . States that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill 's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds , Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation . The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards , Schumer said . CTIA , a cellular phone industry group , said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving . `` CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving , '' said a statement on CTIA 's Web site . Fourteen states , including the home states of three of the bill 's sponsors , and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving : Alaska , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , Tennessee , Utah , Virginia and Washington . Interactive map : See state-by-state policies on distracted driving '' New York does not ban texting while driving but has barred the use of handheld phones while driving , according to the Governor 's Highway Safety Association . Schumer said New York 's legislature has sent Gov. David Paterson a bill to ban texting as well . `` The legislation will send an important message to drivers across the country : Get your hands off the cell phone and back on the wheel , '' Schumer said . The senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers . Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting When compared with dialing , talking , listening or reaching for an electronic device , texting posed the greatest accident risk , the study found . It attributed the increased risk to the almost five seconds it found that the driver 's eyes were off the roadway while texting , said Rich Hanowski , the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute . `` Not having -LSB- a cell phone -RSB- in your hand while driving could be the difference between life and death , '' Menendez said . In September , a commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend , leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people in California , according to federal investigators . The accident also injured 101 people . In May , 62 people were injured when one trolley struck another in Boston , Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said . In July , the operator of one trolley was charged with gross negligence after he admitted to texting seconds before the accident with the other trolley , according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present . Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing . Blagojevich said he expects lawmakers to vote to convict him . He is facing federal corruption allegations , including trying to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president . The second-term Democratic governor has denied wrongdoing . Instead of attending the trial , Blagojevich hit the media circuit Monday . He appeared on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' and `` The View , '' and was scheduled to give his first live prime-time interview Monday night on CNN 's `` Larry King Live . '' Speaking on `` Good Morning America , '' Blagojevich restated his complaints about what he called the `` unconstitutional '' impeachment trial , which he said `` denies me the right to call witnesses to defend myself and prove my innocence . '' Watch Blagojevich say he 's done `` nothing wrong '' '' He said he is certain the Illinois Senate will vote to remove him from office and said he expects they will demand he step down `` relatively soon . '' Earlier this month , the Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach him . Blagojevich has said the vote was politically motivated . Under the Illinois Constitution , the House can vote to impeach an executive or judicial officer , but it is the Senate that conducts the trial . A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict an officer of an impeachable offense . According to a federal complaint issued in December , Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris -- who also was arrested on federal corruption charges -- were `` conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits '' for the governor by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama . `` I 've got this thing and it 's -LSB- expletive -RSB- golden , '' Blagojevich allegedly said in one recorded phone conversation , referring to his authority to appoint , according to the complaint . `` I 'm just not giving it up for -LSB- expletive -RSB- nothing . '' When asked about those alleged quotes , Blagojevich told ABC that federal prosecutors `` took snippets of conversations completely out of context . '' `` When the whole story comes out , you 'll see that the effort was to work to have a senator who can best represent Illinois , '' he said . Blagojevich has said his rights are being violated because he can not challenge assertions in the House impeachment report . Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial '' Blagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett , a confidant of Obama 's ; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel . Emanuel , claimed Blagojevich , agrees that he did not break any laws . State Sen. Matt Murphy , part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together , called Blagojevich 's complaints `` the theater of the absurd . '' iReport.com : Do you trust your political leaders ? `` What you 've seen here ... is a cynical effort on the part of this governor that 's perfectly consistent with his actions over the last six years , to try and further undermine the faith in this process that the people already have , '' Murphy said . He said the House prosecution team responsible for presenting the impeachment case to the Senate is operating under the same restrictions as Blagojevich with regard to calling witnesses . Murphy said on `` Good Morning America '' that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has asked both sides to `` defer to the criminal prosecution '' of Blagojevich and `` limit witnesses . '' He noted that the governor has every right to submit `` positive statements that the governor says exonerate him '' -- such as those from Jarrett , Jackson and Emanuel -- as evidence in the Senate trial . `` We have lowered the standard for the admission of evidence for the governor to bend over backward to make this fair , '' Murphy said . `` The suggestion that this is somehow unfair to the governor is the most self-serving , ludicrous statement I have ever heard in my life . It could n't be fairer for this guy . '' Blagojevich missed deadlines this month for answering the impeachment charge and for filing a motion to dismiss , a spokesman for Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has said .","question":""}

His parents were Timothy John Russert Sr. , or `` Big Russ , '' a newspaper truck driver and sanitation worker , and Elizabeth Russert . Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered immediately to half-staff in Russert 's honor .

'' Russert , who also served as a political analyst for cable network MSNBC , took the helm of `` Meet the Press '' in 1991 , turning the long-running Sunday-morning interview program into the most-watched show of its kind in the United States . During his 17-year run as the host of `` Meet the Press , '' the longest of any host in the show 's 60-year history , Russert earned the respect and admiration of many journalists and politicians . `` He was an institution in both news and politics for more than two decades . Tim was a tough and hardworking newsman . He was always well-informed and thorough in his interviews . And he was as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it , '' President Bush said Friday . His professionalism earned him many accolades . The Washingtonian Magazine once dubbed Russert the best and most influential journalist in Washington , describing `` Meet the Press '' as `` the most interesting and important hour on television .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Supreme Court has granted a condemned Georgia inmate 's request that his execution be delayed as he attempts to prove his innocence . Troy Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail . The inmate , Troy Davis , has gained international support for his long-standing claim that he did not murder a Savannah police officer nearly two decades ago . Justice John Paul Stevens on Monday ordered a federal judge to `` receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner 's innocence . '' Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer supported the decision . Sonia Sotomayor , who was sworn in August 8 as the newest member of the high court , did not take part in the petition . Davis ' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs in the past year . He was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death last fall . A month later , the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed , but a federal appeals court then issued another stay . The high court 's latest ruling means Davis will continue to sit on death row . Stevens said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death `` provides adequate justification '' for another evidentiary hearing . His supporters in June delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County , Georgia , District Attorney Larry Chisolm , calling for a new trial . Chisolm is the county 's first African-American district attorney . Davis is also African-American . Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail . Witnesses said Davis , then 19 , and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man . Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled . But since his 1991 conviction , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony . No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman . The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board last year held closed-door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and Davis himself . The panel decided against clemency . MacPhail 's mother , Annaliese , told CNN at the time , `` This is what we were hoping for , and I hope pretty soon that we will have some peace and start our life , especially my grandchildren -- my grandson and granddaughter . It has overshadowed their lives . '' After the justices in October refused to grant a stay of execution , Davis ' sister , Martina Correia , told CNN she was `` disgusted '' by the decision . `` It does n't make any sense , '' she said . `` We are praying for a miracle or some kind of intervention . We will regroup and fight . We will never stop fighting . We just ca n't be discouraged . The fight is not over till it 's over . '' Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas objected to the court 's decision Monday , calling it a `` fool 's errand . '' `` Petitioner 's claim is a sure loser , '' wrote Scalia . `` Transferring his petition to the -LSB- federal -RSB- District Court is a confusing exercise that can serve no purpose except to delay the state 's execution of its lawful criminal judgment . '' Ten days after the high court refused last October to intervene , a federal appeals court in Georgia granted a temporary stay of execution . Since then , further appeals by Davis ' legal team have dragged on for nearly a year . Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial . Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte ; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr , Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis .","question":""}
{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There have been conflicting accounts of how former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto died Thursday .

{"answer":"If you want to know where American food traditions are headed , look back . Many of today 's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday 's : Nearby farms offering nutritious , peak-of-season produce ; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals ; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods . Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , the USDA says . `` It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage . But today , food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest , most natural way possible , '' says Fern Gale Estrow , M.S. , R.D. , a community nutritionist based in New York City . `` People still want and need to save time in the kitchen , but they 're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it . '' Fortunately , these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful , nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements . Flexitarianism Like vegetarians , `` flexitarians '' eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains , vegetables , and fruits , but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat , fish , poultry , or dairy . A quarter of Americans fit the description , consuming meatless meals at least four days a week , according to the American Dietetic Association . Why it 's here to stay : Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians , nutritional researchers , and public health advocates have been recommending for years . `` It 's about eating a varied diet that 's low in saturated fat and high in fiber , '' says Milton Stokes , M.P.H. , R.D. , chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City , and an ADA spokesperson . Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein , flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain . CookingLight.com : Take our quiz on correct serving sizes What it means for you : Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension , heart disease , diabetes , and prostate and colon cancer . In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans , Louisiana , researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent , and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent . Locally grown foods As people seek fresher foods , they have begun to connect with local family farms . Community-supported agriculture -LRB- CSA -RRB- programs and farmers ' markets give consumers direct access to produce , meats , cheeses , breads , honey , and other foods that are produced in nearby communities . In the past 10 years , the number of local farmers ' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Marketing Service . Why it 's here to stay : Because they are so fresh , locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on `` factory '' farms . The latter , which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States , is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves , and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it 's sold , according to Local Harvest , a nonprofit agricultural research group . All that downtime takes a toll . USDA researchers have found that if it 's not handled properly , produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit . Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable . What it means for you : `` Buying food from local vendors gives you input , '' says Gail Feenstra , R.D. , food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis ' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program . `` You can find out how things were grown . You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that would n't be available elsewhere . '' And then there 's the most important reason of all : Because of its freshness , locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped . `` Growers ' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation , '' Feenstra says . Functional foods Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food . Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D . As sales of these foods have soared in recent years , more functional foods have reached the market , such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids , sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber , high-protein flours . Why it 's here to stay : These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps . `` For example , if you 're lactose intolerant , you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota , '' Stokes says . `` Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem , especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet . '' Likewise , if you dislike seafood , you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta . CookingLight.com : Remembering real portion sizes What it means for you : Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet , not a substitute for it . `` Calcium-fortified orange juice wo n't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide , like protein , '' Estrow says . `` That 's why it 's best to rely on whole foods , which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically . '' In the end , it 's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food , but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources . Organic food These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides , herbicides , and other chemicals used in traditional farming . Organic food is one of the country 's fastest-growing market segments ; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , according to the USDA 's Economic Research Service . Why it 's here to stay : Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost . A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that , on average , organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C , 21 percent more iron , and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods . The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category 's growth , such as cookies , baked goods , and boxed meals , also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness . What it means for you : `` An organic stamp is n't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality , but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated , '' Stokes says . An organic cookie , for example , may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie . But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides , such as peaches , apples , and strawberries , choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals , according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington , D.C. CookingLight.com : All-star foods that fight for health Slow food Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini , `` slow food '' was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle . The trend 's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items , preparing them in traditional ways , and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced , eat-on-the-run lives many people lead . Why it 's here to stay : As with locally grown food , freshness is a key component of the slow food trend . `` Investing the time to choose what 's fresh that day will ensure that night 's meal will be at its peak nutritionally , '' Stokes says .

{"answer":"The Hague , Netherlands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic 's failure to appear at the start of his trial on genocide and war crimes charges CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson explains what happens next . Q : How does the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia -LRB- ICTY -RRB- differ from the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- ? A : The ICTY was set up by the United Nations in 1993 specifically to try people for crimes committed during the break up of the former Yugoslavia . The ICC is the first permanent , treaty-based , international criminal court established to prosecute the most serious crimes of concern to the global community including genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . Q : Why did Karadzic fail to show up in court on Monday ? A : Karadzic failed to show up because he wrote to the court several weeks ago telling judges he had not had sufficient time to prepare his defense . He is a `` self-representing accused , '' meaning he is defending himself . But he is backed by a large number of lawyers supported by a bevy of interns from U.S. law schools . Despite all this legal support , Karadzic says there has been too much evidence for him to go through . Prosecutors say they have 490 hours of evidence to present . The judge wrote back to Karadzic last week telling him he does n't need to present his defense yet , he can do it after the prosecution . But Karadzic still refused to show . The court can not compel him to come even though he is held in a detention facility about seven minutes drive from the court run exclusively for those awaiting or on trial at the tribunal . The detention facility is a lot more comfortable than a conventional jail . Karadzic will be able to watch TV when he wants , he has access to books and can mix with other defendants . Indeed , detention facility staff report that members of all three ethnic groups -- Serbs , Croats and Bosnians -- mingle freely , even playing games together . Q : Can the trial proceed without a defendant in the dock ? A : The trial can go ahead without Karadzic present because there is no legal reason that says he needs to be there , even though he is defending himself . But the court is bound to give him a fair trial so if the prosecution begins without him the judges may give Karadzic a video feed so he can watch proceedings unfold . Q : How long is the trial expected to last ? A : The trial could last at least two years and possibly three . The court allows at least one year for the prosecution and one year for the defense as a minimum . Q : What measures have been put in place to prevent a repeat of the delays and obfuscation seen during the trial of the former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic ? A : Milosovic 's trial dragged on because he defended himself , refused to accept the legitimacy of court and because of the complexity of the case and lengthy charge list -- 66 counts -- against him . Karadzic 's case is less complex and this is one of the lessons prosecutors have learned from the Milosevic trial : make cases simpler and only go for those that can be readily proved . But with Karadzic defending himself and refusing to accept the court 's legitimacy , the judges are still struggling to figure out how to deal with tactics designed to delay the trial . They are likely to be less lenient than they were with Milosevic .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kim Clijsters defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in the final of the Brisbane International on Saturday , saving two match-points and wasting three as she won an epic clash . Henin , playing her first tournament since May 2008 , fought back from a set and 4-1 down against her fellow Belgian before losing 6-3 4-6 7-6 -LRB- 8-6 -RRB- in almost two and a half hours . However , Henin sustained an injury to her left leg and later confirmed on her Web site that she will miss next week 's Sydney Invitational , where she faced a possible second-round clash with Serena Williams , in order to recover in time for the decade 's first Grand Slam event , the Australian Open . Clijsters , who made history in September as the first unseeded player to win the U.S. Open in her third event back on the WTA Tour following her own short-lived retirement , took control as she won eight straight games . But fellow former world No. 1 Henin dug deep to level the match and then take a 3-0 lead in the deciding set . The 26-year-old Clijsters battled back to tie it up at 3-3 , and then both players squandered potentially match-winning break opportunities to ensure a tie-break . Clijsters raced to a 5-1 lead , helped by her first ace of the match -- coming off a second serve -- but then missed three match-point chances at 6-3 . Henin again fought back to level at 6-6 but then her 11th double-fault gave Clijsters the chance to finally close out for victory , her 11th in 23 meeting between the two players . Clijsters clinched her 36th WTA Tour title , leaving Henin stuck on 41 . `` What a match ! '' Clijsters said . `` I think we set the bar pretty high for ourselves for the rest of the year . Justine played at a really high level for the whole tournament , so congratulations . '' Meanwhile , top seed Andy Roddick will play defending champion Radek Stepanek in Sunday 's men 's final at the Pat Rafter Arena . Roddick came from behind to beat Stepanek 's fellow Czech Tomas Berdych in the semifinals on Saturday , with the American winning 1-6 6-3 6-4 despite being broken for the first time in the tournament in his opening service game . Second seed Stepanek won 6-2 6-1 against Frenchman Gael Monfils , who was struggling with a shoulder problem . The world No. 13 told the tournament 's Web site that he was unsure if he would take part in next week 's Sydney International .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three former guerrilla leaders -- who helped command what one activist called `` one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days '' -- were sentenced Wednesday in Freetown , Sierra Leone , for crimes against humanity . Amputee victims of Sierra Leone 's civil war take part in football training at a beach in Freetown . The U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone found the men guilty in February of crimes that included murder , rape , sexual slavery and forced marriages stemming from a civil war that lasted from March 1991 to January 2002 . They were arrested in March 2003 , said Peter Anderson , spokesman for the U.N. court . The rebels -- former leaders in the Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement -- were known for hacking off civilians ' hands and feet during the war , which stood out for its viciousness even on a a continent that has suffered many horrific conflicts . Presiding Judge Pierre Boutet of Canada read the sentences . Former Revolutionary United Front `` interim leader '' Issa Hassan Sesay was sentenced to 52 years in prison , former commander Morris Kallon to 40 years , and former chief of security Augustine Gbao to 25 years . Sesay and Kallon had been found guilty on 16 counts , and Gbao was found guilty on 14 . The former rebels received credit for the six years each already has served in prison , Anderson told CNN . He said they will be imprisoned in another country , maybe Rwanda , because the prisons in Sierra Leone do not meet the standards of the U.N. court . Kallon was the only one of the three to express sorrow at his sentencing , Anderson said . `` He really had made a genuine expression of remorse , '' which is considered a stronger statement than regret , the court spokesman added . The court noted several mitigating factors at the sentencing , but `` in view of the gravity of the crimes , their impact was limited , '' a statement from the court said . The court noted that the crimes `` were committed upon a massive scale across several districts of Sierra Leone '' and that `` the impact of all these crimes upon the Sierra Leonean society has been enormous . '' `` The Chamber concluded that the inherent gravity of the criminal acts for which Sesay , Kallon and Gbao have been convicted is exceptionally high , '' the statement said . Corinne Dufka , a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch 's Africa division , had called the verdict `` very significant . '' `` The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days . Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation , but there was also horrific sexual violence , abductions , use of child soldiers and forced marriages , '' she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa . Eight people have been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebels ' side and some on the government 's . The U.N. Special Court 's mandate is to try only `` those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone . '' The trial of Sesay , Kallon and Gbao lasted nearly five years . The three had pleaded not guilty on all counts . The Special Court can not impose the death penalty . The Revolutionary United Front seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers . International forces retook the capital , Freetown , in 2000 . The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court . Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague , Netherlands , for his role in the conflict . The prosecution rested in the Taylor case in January after a year of presenting its arguments . Sierra Leone is known for its diamond wealth , but 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line . The Special Court is an independent tribunal established jointly by the United Nations and the Sierra Leone government . It is mandated to bring to justice those most responsible for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone after November 30 , 1996 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Arsenal climbed to the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 victory over London rivals West Ham despite playing half of Saturday 's clash with only 10 men . Arsene Wenger 's team moved a point above champions Manchester United , who host Liverpool on Sunday , while Chelsea dropped to third ahead of their trip to Blackburn . Carlo Ancelotti 's side can join Arsenal on 67 points with victory in that game . Gianfranco Zola 's West Ham team were left to rue a missed penalty as the defeat left them just three points above the relegation zone . Arsenal , who on Friday were handed a chance to avenge 2006 's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in the upcoming quarterfinals , took the lead after just five minutes in the rain at the Emirates Stadium . Brazil midfielder Denilson fired in a low shot for his sixth goal this season , having dispossessed Valon Behrami and then played a neat one-two on the edge of the area with striker Nicklas Bendtner . But Arsenal could not turn their dominance into further goals , and West Ham should have leveled just before halftime when Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen was sent off as his nudge in the back of Guillermo Franco saw the Mexico striker tumble in the box . But Alessandro Diamanti saw his penalty saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia , and the hosts also escaped in the second half when substitute striker Carlton Cole saw his fierce low shot hit the outside of the post . Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas made the points safe on his return from injury five minutes after that with a penalty on 82 , as England defender Matthew Upson paid the price for deliberately blocking the Spain midfielder 's clever little flick with his arm . Tottenham consolidated fourth place with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at 10-man Stoke , as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen came off the bench to put the London club ahead before Dean Whitehead was sent off and then helped set up Niko Kranjcar 's 77th-minute winner . The on-loan Iceland forward netted just 18 seconds after halftime having come on for Roman Pavlyuchenko , who joined England striker Jermain Defoe on the injured list after suffering a hamstring problem in the first half . Whitehead went three minutes later for his second booking , but Stoke leveled on 64 as winger Matthew Etherington scored from the penalty spot against his former club after fullback Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled striker Paul Kitson . Gudjohnsen 's dummy allowed Croatia midfielder Kranjcar to put the Londoners four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool , who will have played one more match after Sunday 's trip to bitter North-West rivals United . The victory was doubly important for Tottenham after fellow Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa had to come from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw with lowly Wolverhampton in the Midlands derby earlier on Saturday . John Carew put Villa ahead in the 16th minute despite appearing to be offside , and the Norway striker salvaged a point for the hosts with eight minutes remaining as he steered Steve Sidwell 's low shot into the visitors ' net for his 13th league goal this season . Wolves moved four points clear of the bottom three , but were denied a first win at Villa Park in 30 years despite Jody Craddock 's bundled 23rd-minute equalizer and an own-goal from England international James Milner seven minutes before halftime . The result left Villa in seventh , having played one less game than Tottenham , equal on 50 points with Manchester City , who travel to Fulham on Sunday . Everton moved above Birmingham into eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Bolton , who had Gretar Steinsson sent off in the 71st minute for bringing down Nigeria striker Yakubu . Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta fired in the resulting freekick and South Africa international Steven Pienaar wrapped up victory with a minute to go after Leon Osman hit the crossbar . Birmingham crashed 3-1 at Sunderland , who eased their relegation worries as England World Cup hopeful Darren Bent scored twice in the first 11 minutes to take his Premier League tally to 20 goals this season and 21 overall . Wigan moved seven points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Burnley , as Colombia striker Hugo Rodallega 's 90th-minute header left the visitors deep in relegation trouble after a 15th defeat in 16 away matches . Hull remain second from bottom , behind Burnley on goal difference , as new manager Iain Dowie suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat at basement club Portsmouth in his match in charge . The visitors led 2-1 with 17 minutes to play after two goals from striker Caleb Folan , but Portsmouth 's on-loan midfielder Jamie O'Hara leveled in the 88th minute with a curled free-kick and the Nigerian veteran Kanu netted a late winner . Portsmouth are still set to be relegated after being docked nine points for going into administration , now 14 points from safety with eight games to play .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Woody Harrelson defended his clash with a photographer at a New York airport Wednesday night as a case of mistaken identity -- he says he mistook the cameraman for a zombie . Woody Harrelson says he got into a clash with a photographer because he mistook him for a zombie . The TMZ photographer filed a complaint with police claiming the actor damaged his camera and pushed him in the face at La Guardia Airport , according to an airport spokesman . `` We 're looking into this allegation and if it 's warranted , we 'll turn it over to the proper authorities , '' said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Ron Marsico . The photographer , who was not identified , captured the encounter on a small camera after his larger one was broken . Harrelson , who is being sued by another TMZ photographer for an alleged assault in 2006 , did not deny his involvement . `` I wrapped a movie called ` Zombieland , ' in which I was constantly under assault by zombies , then flew to New York , still very much in character , '' Harrelson said in a statement issued Friday by his publicist . `` With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo , who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie , '' he said . TMZ.com posted two videos of the incident , including one recorded by the larger camera before it was damaged . The first video shows the photographer following Harrelson and his daughter down an escalator and out of the terminal . It ends with Harrelson apparently reaching for the lens . The second video begins with the photographer accusing Harrelson of breaking his camera . After Harrelson returns the camera to him , a scuffle appears to ensue . `` Woody , this is assault . Woody , this is assault , '' the photographer is heard saying . `` Woody , chill out . Would you please chill out ? '' The photographer continues to follow Harrelson for another four minutes as the actor and his daughter walk to the airport parking lot . At one point , Harrelson again turns toward the cameraman . `` I 'm being chased by Woody Harrelson while I 'm talking to you , '' the photographer says as he talks to an unidentified person on a cell phone . `` He hit me in my face , he broke my friggin ' camera , he broke the camera in pieces , '' he said . Harrelson , his daughter and a driver get inside an SUV and the encounter ends . In the movie `` Zombieland , '' Harrelson plays `` the most frightened person on Earth '' looking for refuge from zombies , according to the Internet Movie Database Filming on the movie wrapped in Atlanta , Georgia , on Wednesday , according to director Ruben Fleischer 's Web site . TMZ photographer Josh Levine filed a lawsuit against Harrelson last year for an alleged attack outside a Hollywood nightclub in 2006 . Video of that incident , which is also posted on TMZ.com , also appeared to show Harrelson grabbing a camera and clashing with the photographer . Los Angeles prosecutors declined to press charges against the actor , but Levine filed a suit last summer asking for $ 2.5 million in damages . `` Woody Harrelson has a history of anger management issues with people and we intend to put a stop to this , '' Cyrus Nownejad , Levine 's lawyer , said Friday .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel could accept a peace agreement with a `` demilitarized Palestinian state '' as its neighbor . Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would agree to peace with Palestinians . In his first speech accepting the concept of a two-state solution for the Middle East conflict , Netanyahu set rigid conditions for moving forward . Among them : unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the Jewish national state with Jerusalem as its capital , and full demilitarization for a Palestinian state -- no army , no rockets or missiles , no control of airspace . `` I say this in a clear voice -- if we receive a guarantee of this demilitarized unit , we will be prepared to reach agreement to a demilitarized Palestine side by side with the Jewish state , '' Netanyahu said , according to a direct translation of his speech at Bar-Ilan University 's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Ramat Gan , Israel . Initial Palestinian reaction was negative , with Palestinian legislator Mustafa Barghouti saying Netanyahu was calling for creation of a ghetto state . `` He is proving there is no partner for peace in Israel , '' Barghouti told CNN . Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Netanyahu `` left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table . '' `` He announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable , independent and sovereign Palestinian state impossible , '' Erakat said . `` This speech fell far short of every single one of the benchmarks required of Israel in line with international law and existing agreements , '' he said , including the 2003 Roadmap for Peace . Netanyahu 's speech , billed as a major statement on the peace process , follows President Obama 's recent high-profile speech to the Muslim world and a visit to the region by Obama 's Middle East envoy , former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell . Obama welcomed Netanyahu 's speech as `` an important step forward '' and said the president remained committed to a two-state solution that would ensure Israel 's security and provide the Palestinians `` a viable state , '' according to a White House statement . Obama pledged to continue working with all parties `` to see that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities , '' the statement said . Netanyahu , of the center-right Likud party , previously refused to endorse a two-state solution . Netanyahu sounded themes popular with his conservative followers , repeatedly referring to Israel as the Jewish national homeland and demanding recognition of that by all Arab foes , including the Palestinians , for any chance at a peace agreement . He prompted applause with his statement that `` the land of Israel is homeland to the Jewish people , and that is the basis of our right to it . '' `` The Palestinian leadership must rise up and say in a very straight way that we are tired of this conflict , we will recognize the right of the Jewish people to have a national homeland in this part of the world , '' Netanyahu said , according to the direct translation . He said Jerusalem would remain the capital of Israel -- refusing to yield on a sensitive issue for Palestinians -- and that a Palestinian state would have to be fully demilitarized to ensure the safety of Israel . Obama , in his June 4 speech in Cairo , Egypt , endorsed a two-state solution and urged compromise between `` two peoples with legitimate aspirations . '' He repeated his call for both Israel and the Palestinians to fulfill all obligations under the 2003 Roadmap for Peace , including a halt to any expansion of West Bank settlements by Israel . Obama called America 's bond with Israel `` unbreakable '' but said Palestinians have suffered in pursuit of a homeland . He also called for an end to Palestinian incitement against Israel and greater security in Palestinian territories . On Sunday , Netanyahu acknowledged the suffering on both sides from the continuing Middle East conflict , but insisted the roots of the conflict came from the Arab world 's refusal to accept Israel 's right to exist .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda in Iraq is trying to foment sectarian tensions by attacking and killing Iraqi civilians , a government spokesman said Monday . Iraqi women gather near the site of an attack in the village of al-Khazna , near Mosul , on Monday . Explosions across the country have killed 50 and wounded 231 others , most of them civilians in Shiite areas , according to Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf . `` Most of the terrorist attacks carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq were against civilians and not Iraqi security forces , '' Khalaf said . `` This is an indication that al Qaeda in Iraq can not face the Iraqi security forces . '' Monday 's deadliest attack happened near the northern city of Mosul when two truck bombs destroyed 32 homes , killing 30 people and burying others in the rubble , officials said . The bombs targeted al-Khazna village , which is inhabited by a Shiite Shabak ethnic group . The village is an area disputed between Kurds and Arabs . Car bombings and a roadside bomb in Baghdad killed 18 others on Monday , most of them Shiites . `` This is the card that al Qaeda in Iraq is now playing by targeting mostly Shiite areas and neighborhoods to agitate the sectarian violence , '' Khalaf said . `` But this will not happen because Iraqi security forces and Iraqi people in general are aware of this losing game and they will not fall into this trap . '' On Monday afternoon , two children -- brothers aged 5 and 9 -- were killed when a roadside bomb detonated near them as they played in a yard in northern Tikrit , about 99 miles -LRB- 160 km -RRB- north of Baghdad , a police official said . The attacks come after a series of bombings in Iraq on Friday , mostly aimed at Shiite targets , which killed 50 and wounded 154 others . Friday 's deadliest attack happened when a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque where a funeral was taking place , killing 38 . Last week 's attacks occurred at the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration marking the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi , the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites . Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunnis . The bombings sparked fears of sectarian violence and called into question the ability of Iraqi forces . The United States pulled back its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns on June 30 , leaving security responsibilities to the Iraqis and remaining only in a training and advisory capacity . The U.S. military continues to conduct combat operations in areas outside cities and towns . Khalaf said the recent attacks are part of `` an escalation of violence '' over the past two months ahead of national elections in January . `` The enemy of Iraq wants to bring down political progress in the country , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a race to beat the flu season , medical institutes across the United States will begin human trials for a new H1N1 flu vaccine starting in early August , the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday . Concern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year . In the hope of getting the vaccine to those who will need it most by October , the clinical trials will enroll as many as 1,000 adults and children at 10 centers nationwide , said officials at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , a division of the NIH , which will lead the effort . The trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine . The research is a first step toward U.S. health officials ' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against H1N1 , also known as swine flu , which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization The time frame for developing a vaccine is a tight one . `` It 's going to be close , '' said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health . `` I believe it can be -LSB- ready by October -RSB- if things run smoothly . We hope they will , but you never can tell when you 're dealing with biological phenomena like making vaccines and administering them . '' The announcement of the U.S. trials followed the announcement earlier this week , by an Australian company , CSL Ltd. , of the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine . Concern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year . `` This virus has the potential to cause significant illness with hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. flu season this fall and winter , '' said Dr. Karen Kotloff , professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at Maryland 's Center for Vaccine Development . `` Vaccines have always been a vital tool for controlling influenza . The results of these studies will help to guide the optimal use of the H1N1 vaccines in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world . '' After careful screening , volunteers will be inoculated and then asked to keep a diary on how they feel . After eight days their blood will be checked and after 21 days they will receive another dose , followed again by diary logs and blood tests . Patients will be monitored two months for safety issues , followed by a four-month and six-month checkup . `` The purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe , '' Kotloff said . `` But even after six weeks , if things look good , we 're pretty sure the vaccine will work . '' She noted the response to the vaccine may vary in different age groups . `` This is because young people have not seen a flu virus like this one before , '' she noted . `` Older adults might have some immunity to the new H1N1 virus as a result of being exposed to similar flu viruses in the past . As a result , older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals . '' The vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals , where it has shown to be effective . Further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant , a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines , can make it work better at lower doses . Other trial sites along with the University of Maryland Medical Center are Baylor College of Medicine , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , Emory University , Saint Louis University , Seattle Group Health Cooperative , the University of Iowa , and Vanderbilt University . They will be joined by Children 's Mercy Hospital and Duke University Medical Center . CNN 's Valerie Willingham and Matt Cherry contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"MUNICH , Germany -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alleged Nazi camp guard John Demjanjuk had no choice but to bring Jews to their deaths in extermination camps , Demjanjuk 's defense argued Monday as his long-awaited trial got under way . Demjanjuk , 89 , faces charges of being an accessory to about 27,900 murders during World War II . But his defense attorney , Ulrich Busch , said Monday the court was imposing a `` moral and judicial double standard . '' The retired auto worker from Cleveland , Ohio -- a native Ukrainian -- was a prisoner of war during the conflict , and would have been killed had he not done what the Nazis ordered , the defense team argued . The defense line that Demjanjuk was forced to help the Nazis represents a change for the defendant , who has denied in the past that he was a camp guard . The guards forced to help the Nazis were `` victims , not culprits -- survivors , not murderers , '' defense lawyer Busch said . Higher-ranking German SS officers in a similar situation have been found not guilty of war crimes , the defense argued . The Munich state prosecutor brought the charges against Demjanjuk for his alleged role at the Sobibor death camp in Poland , where the Nazis and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people , according to the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum . About 30 relatives of victims have joined the prosecution case . In Germany it is possible for the families to join the prosecution case as co-plaintiffs , representing named individuals who died in the death camps . If Demjanjuk is found guilty , it will not be only for 27,900 anonymous murders , but for the murders of victims specifically named by the co-plantiffs . There are very few remaining survivors of Sobibor . Demjanjuk 's defenders say he was a Soviet prisoner of war at the Trawniki camp , where Nazis trained prisoners to assist with the extermination of about 2 million Jews in occupied Poland . Those prisoners of war had no choice but to assist , the defense said . Demjanjuk was brought into the court in a wheelchair , accompanied by medical personnel and a German-Ukrainian translator . He did not speak in the opening phase of the trial , and had his eyes shut most of the time . The trial is expected to last until May of next year . He was deported in May from the United States to Germany . The German court originally accused him of complicity in about 29,000 murders . The prosecutor 's office said it revised the number because some of those who had allegedly died in the camp when Demjanjuk was there were already dead during the transport to Sobibor . Demjanjuk lost a U.S. Supreme Court case against his deportation . His lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he was too ill and frail to be sent overseas . They also raised human rights and other legal issues . The Munich State Court ruled earlier this year he was fit to stand trial . But doctors have restricted the time he can be tried each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each , said Anton Winkler , Munich state prosecutor . The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s , when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as `` Ivan the Terrible . '' His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981 , and he was extradited to Israel in 1986 . Demjanjuk was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death , but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was `` Ivan the Terrible . '' A federal court restored Demjanjuk 's citizenship , ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case . But his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in Afghanistan last month that killed seven CIA employees and contractors and a Jordanian military officer , according to a statement posted on Islamist Web sites . Mustafa Abu Yazid , al Qaeda 's commander of operations in Afghanistan and its No. 3 man , said the attack avenged the death of Baitullah Mehsud , leader of the Taliban in Pakistan who was killed in a missile strike last August , and al Qaeda operatives Saleh al-Somali and Abdullah al-Libi . The December 30 blast at a U.S. base in Khost , in southeastern Afghanistan , killed seven CIA operatives including two from private security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater . The eighth victim was Jordanian Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid , a cousin of Jordan 's King Abdullah II . A former U.S. intelligence official identified the suicide bomber as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi , a Jordanian doctor who acted as a double agent . He was recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source , according to a senior Jordanian official . U.S. sources said bin Zeid was the Jordanian operative working closely with al-Balawi , who was from the same hometown as the onetime leader of al Qaeda in Iraq , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed that al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri , al Qaeda 's No. 2 figure , the former intelligence official said . The al Qaeda statement posted Wednesday identified al-Balawi as Hamam Khalil Mohammed Abu Malal , who used the name Abu Dujana Khorasani . It said Abu Dujana was a well-known Islamist author and a preacher on jihadi Web sites , an immigrant for his faith and a fighter who sacrificed himself and his money for his God and belief . `` May God accept him as a martyr who was able to infiltrate the Americans ' forts , '' the statement said . `` We ask God to bless the people who follow your path , Abu Dujana , '' it said . `` Let them know that your brothers are following your path and they will not have peace of mind until they slaughter the Americans and let the Islamic nation be proud for having men like you among its sons . '' Several groups have claimed responsibility for the attack , one of the worst blows ever to America 's intelligence community . Some analysts said that militant groups may be competing for credit to spread the word and attract fresh donations and recruits . In a posting on its Web site last week , the Taliban in Afghanistan claimed that the bomber was an Afghan National Army soldier . On Sunday , however , Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud said in an e-mail that his arm of the Islamic movement carried out the attack , also citing the reason as revenge for Baitullah Mehsud 's killing .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Human rights and freedom of the press in China , the detention of terrorist suspects by the United States and Russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in Amnesty International 's annual report , released Wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . Amnesty International protestors outside the US Supreme Court in January dressed as Guantanamo Bay detainees . The 398-page report comes 60 years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and Amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` The biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . Irene Khan , Amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in Darfur , Zimbabwe , Gaza , Iraq and Myanmar demand immediate attention . '' The report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' According to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . Of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , Amnesty paid particular attention to China , the host of this summer 's Olympic Games . The group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in China in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including Tibetans , Falun Gong practitioners and Christians -- repressed or persecuted . Death penalty statistics in China are difficult to assess , Amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . Amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in China and said censorship of the Internet and other media intensified last year . `` The Chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` They decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . The authorities continued to block Web sites and to filter Internet content based on specified words and topics . '' Around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , Amnesty said . Amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the United States , where 42 people were executed last year . It noted New Jersey 's decision in December to abolish the death penalty made it the first U.S. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . As it has in previous annual reports , Amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . `` The USA must close Guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' Amnesty said . The group noted that Guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to U.S. courts . Most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , Amnesty said . In fact , more is written on the United States than any other country listed in the report . Asked about that at a press conference Tuesday , Khan said , `` We certainly devote a lot of time to Sudan , to China , to Zimbabwe and other countries . But we look to the U.S. to provide leadership around the world . Governments around the world look to the United States as a role model for their own behavior . '' In a lengthy section on Iraq , Amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` All sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . Abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million Iraqis to flee to Syria , Jordan and elsewhere , Amnesty said . U.S. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' In Afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` At least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including Afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' Russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , Amnesty said . `` The Russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` A crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the State Duma -LSB- parliament -RSB- elections in December . '' The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in Chechnya , Amnesty said . There were fewer reported disappearances in the Chechen Republic in 2007 than in previous years , Amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . The report also criticized human rights conditions in Iran , Gaza and Myanmar . Human rights conditions in Zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression . '' Members of the main opposition party , the MDC , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , Amnesty said . Some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in `` deplorable conditions '' while President Robert Mugabe 's government failed to remedy their situation . `` Human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us , '' Khan said . `` Governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the United Nations to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 60 years ago .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ailing `` Great Train Robber '' Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- was formally released from prison to his death bed Friday after being granted his freedom on compassionate grounds . Ronnie Biggs , pictured at a book launch in Rio de Janeiro in 1994 . Biggs , who is gravely ill with severe pneumonia , is being cared for at a hospital in Norwich , eastern England , where he was moved on Tuesday . Three prison staff who had been assigned to Biggs ' bedside have been withdrawn following UK Justice Minister Jack Straw 's decision to authorize his release , a Ministry of Justice spokesperson told CNN . `` The medical evidence clearly shows that Mr Biggs is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently , culminating in his re-admission to hospital , '' Straw said in a statement Thursday . `` His condition is not expected to improve . '' Biggs ' son , Michael Biggs , said his father was `` over the moon '' that he had been released on the eve of his 80th birthday . Speaking to reporters outside the hospital , he confirmed his father had been handed his release papers . `` As a family , we are absolutely thrilled , '' Michael Biggs said , according to the UK 's Press Association . Biggs is unable to walk , barely able to communicate and no longer able to eat or drink , Michael Biggs said , adding that the family was `` very hopeful that my father will be able to survive the next few days . '' Biggs ' legal advisor Giovanni Di Stefano told journalists that Biggs was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed . `` This man is ill , he 's going to die ... he is going to stay in hospital , '' he said . Saturday also marks the 46th anniversary of the infamous 1963 heist dubbed the `` crime of the century '' that transformed Biggs from a petty London thief into one of the most wanted men in Britain . Biggs and 14 other professional criminals made off with more than # 2.5 million -LRB- $ 4.2 million -RRB- in used bank notes -- the equivalent of around # 40 million -LRB- $ 67 million -RRB- today -- after holding up a mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of the morning . In the course of the robbery the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar . Most of the gang , including Biggs , were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils . Biggs was sentenced to 30 years in prison but escaped over the wall of a London prison after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive . After undergoing extensive plastic surgery in Paris , Biggs made his way to Australia , living there with his wife and two children . Tracked down by police , Biggs fled again in 1969 , this time to Brazil . Five years later , Biggs was traced once more by a newspaper reporter . Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Jack Slipper , who had led police efforts to bring the train robbers to justice , flew out to Rio de Janeiro to arrest Biggs , allegedly greeting him at a beachside hotel : `` Long time no see , Ronnie . '' But efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then he had fathered a Brazilian-born son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition . Biggs continued to live openly in Rio , trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists , selling t-shirts and even recording with the Sex Pistols . In 1981 he was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers and smuggled to Barbados . But legal efforts to have Biggs brought back to the UK once again stalled and he was allowed to return to Brazil . By the late 1990s Biggs was in poor health following a series of strokes and running out of cash . In 2001 he flew back to the UK on a private jet laid on by the Sun newspaper . He was promptly locked up in a high security prison but then moved to a facility for elderly prisoners . Since his return Biggs and his family have campaigned for his parole on compassionate grounds -- an appeal until now rejected by successive justice ministers on the grounds that Biggs had never shown any remorse for his actions . Michael Biggs said his father had expressed regret for the robbery -- but not for the life he had led in the years since the crime .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mumia Abu-Jamal sits on Pennsylvania 's death row , perhaps the most recognized of the 228 condemned inmates at the Greene Correctional Facility , an hour south of Pittsburgh . Former radio host and convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal during a 1994 interview Abu-Jamal , inmate AM8335 , awaits three milestones . His new book , `` Jailhouse Lawyers , '' will be released next month . He 's also awaiting a pair of Supreme Court decisions , which could come in the next two weeks . The former Black Panther was sentenced to die for gunning down a Philadelphia police officer 28 years ago . The high court will decide whether he deserves a new hearing to determine whether his execution should go forward . The state is appealing a federal appeals court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu-Jamal 's favor last year . The case has attracted international attention . Abu-Jamal 's lawyers filed a separate appeal claiming that racism led to his 1982 conviction . That petition is scheduled for consideration by the Supreme Court on April 3 . If either case is accepted by the justices for review , oral arguments would be held in the fall . The former radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial . Others counter that Abu-Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions . They say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism . He was convicted for the December 9 , 1981 , murder of officer Daniel Faulkner , 25 , in Philadelphia . Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal 's brother in a late-night traffic stop . Witnesses said Abu-Jamal , who was nearby , ran over and shot the police officer in the back and in the head . Abu-Jamal , once known as Wesley Cook , was also wounded in the confrontation and later admitted to the killing , according to other witnesses ' testimony . Abu-Jamal is black , and the police officer was white . Incarcerated for nearly three decades , Abu-Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system . On a Web site created by friends to promote his release , the prisoner-turned-author writes about his fight . `` This is the story of law learned , not in the ivory towers of multi-billion dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave-ship , in the hidden , dank dungeons of America . '' His chief defense attorney , Robert Bryan , has filed appeals asking for a new criminal trial . `` The central issue in this case is racism in jury selection , '' he wrote to supporters last month . `` We are in an epic struggle in which his life hangs in the balance . What occurs now in the Supreme Court will determine whether Mumia will have a new jury trial or die at the hands of the executioner , '' Bryan said . Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced him to death . A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals kept the murder conviction in place a year ago but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing . `` The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , '' Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica wrote in the 77-page opinion . The federal appeals court ultimately concluded that the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh `` mitigating factors '' offered by the defense that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row . Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance , such as the fact that Abu-Jamal had no prior criminal record . Months before that ruling , oral arguments on the issue were contentious . Faulkner 's widow and Abu-Jamal 's brother attended , and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia . If the Supreme Court refuses now to intervene on the sentencing issue , the city 's prosecutor would have to decide within six months whether to conduct a new death penalty sentencing hearing or allow Abu-Jamal to spend the rest of his life in state prison . Many prominent groups and individuals , including singer Harry Belafonte , the NAACP and the European Parliament , are cited on his Web site as supporters . Prosecutors have insisted that Abu-Jamal pay the price for his crimes and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row for Faulkner 's murder . `` This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu-Jamal is some kind of a folk hero , '' Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said last year , when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction . `` He is nothing short of an assassin . '' The city has honored the fallen police officer with a street designation and a commemorative plaque placed at the spot where he was shot and killed . The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , wrote a book two years ago about her husband and the case : `` Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Loss , Pain and Injustice . '' She writes that she was trying to `` definitively lay out the case against Mumia Abu-Jamal and those who 've elevated him to the status of political prisoner . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli troops Thursday killed a Palestinian militant trying to cross into Israel from Gaza and wounded another , according to Palestinian security sources . Israeli soldiers stand in front of the Kerem Shalom crossing Thursday on the Israel-Gaza border . Three armed militants tried to infiltrate into Israel near the Kerem Shalom crossing along the southern Gaza border , according to the Israeli military . Israel Defense Forces said it fired at the militants , hitting two of them . It was unclear what happened to the third . In a separate operation , Israeli forces killed another Palestinian militant Thursday near Jabalya in northern Gaza , Palestinian security sources said . The militant was part of a group trying to launch a mortar shell , sources said . On April 9 , Palestinian militants infiltrated Israel through the Nahal Oz border crossing in northern Gaza and fired on the fuel terminal there , killing two Israeli civilian workers . In response , Israel halted already reduced fuel shipments to Gaza . It restarted some shipments on Wednesday but shut down the terminal again Thursday because of Palestinian sniper fire , according to the Israeli military . During the brief time the terminal was open , Israel sent 437,000 liters of diesel fuel and 93 tons of gas to Gaza via Nahal Oz , the only transit route for delivering fuel supplies to Gaza . Israeli forces also clashed early Thursday with Palestinian militants in the West Bank village of Qabatiya , killing the local Islamic Jihad leader and his deputy , the Israeli military said . Bilal Hamuda Machmud Zaalah and his deputy , Adin Machmud Hasani Avidot , were hiding in a vehicle when Israeli soldiers and security forces spotted them and surrounded the vehicle , the military said . `` After confirming that the two men were armed , forces fired at the wanted men , killing both , '' according to an IDF statement . Israel blames Zaalah for attacks against Israeli forces in the West Bank town of Jenin as well as other planned strikes inside Israel . But Palestinian medical sources and witnesses said Israeli forces surrounded a house around 3 a.m. , ordering the two members of Islamic Jihad to surrender . The militants would n't come out , the sources said , and they died in an exchange of fire with the soldiers . The violence came a day after Israeli airstrikes and ground battles with Palestinian militants in Gaza left 21 dead -- 18 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers -- according to Palestinian security sources . A Reuters cameraman and two bystanders were killed in an apparent airstrike near El Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza , according to Hamas security sources and Palestinian medical sources . Other civilians and Palestinian militants also were killed in an Israeli strike on El Bureij . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , in a statement through his spokesman , said he 's `` gravely concerned at the escalation of violence in Gaza and southern Israel '' on Wednesday . `` He condemns the reported civilian casualties among Palestinians , including children , during Israeli military operations , and calls on Israel to abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law , '' the statement said . `` The secretary-general also reiterates his condemnation of rocket fire against Israeli civilian targets . He urges all parties to exercise restraint . '' E-mail to a friend","question":""}
{"answer":"KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to pass a resolution extending the mandate of NATO-led military forces in Afghanistan for a year , hours after a deadly bombing near the Indian Embassy in Kabul . The bomb exploded in the center of Kabul on the corner of Passport Lane and the Indian Embassy . The suicide car bomb attack on Thursday left at least 17 people dead , most of them civilians , and 63 wounded . `` I think this is another reminder of the dangers that the Taliban pose to the Afghan population and to the international community in Afghanistan , and the importance of the continued international efforts there , '' said John Sawers , Britain 's ambassador to the world body , after the resolution was passed . The council provides international legal approval for the deployment of NATO troops to assist in the protection of civilians in armed conflict . The resolution , however , did not address troop numbers , an issue that has generated controversy since the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , requested an additional 40,000 troops . The Security Council also condemned the attack , calling for the `` perpetrators , organizers , financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism '' to be brought to justice . In addition to extending the mandate , the resolution stressed the need to bolster Afghan security forces to help them become self-sufficient in protecting their country . Anders Fogh Rasmussen , NATO 's new leader , recently announced that NATO forces would begin training Afghan police and increase training of the Afghan National Army . Some 90,000 international forces are deployed in Afghanistan , with 35,000 serving with NATO and 65,000 with the United States . The Taliban claimed responsibility for the Thursday bombing , saying an Afghan national in a sport utility vehicle carried out the attack . The bomber had intended to strike the embassy , Indian officials said . Watch what a local shopkeeper says about the area '' `` The suicide attack -LRB- er -RRB- ... attempted -LRB- to go -RRB- through one of the embassy gates , '' Vishnu Prakash , spokesman for India 's external affairs ministry , told CNN on Thursday . `` The embassy was the target . '' The bomb went off about 8:30 a.m. , just as offices and shops were opening for the day . The force of the blast shattered some of the embassy 's windows , according to Prakash . The bombing came a year after a similar deadly attack outside the Indian Embassy . The Thursday attack killed 17 -- most of them civilians -- and 63 were wounded , Interior Ministry spokesman Ezmary Bashary said . The Taliban said the attack killed 35 people , including high-ranking Indian Embassy officials , as well as international and Afghan police officers . The blast damaged a security checkpoint outside the the embassy , said staffer J.P. Singh , but `` there were no casualties on the Indian side . '' The embassy is in the center of Kabul , in a shop-lined street across from the Interior Ministry and several other government buildings . The explosion shattered car windows and toppled restaurant walls . Paramedics dug through twisted metal and debris , looking for survivors . A statement from President Hamid Karzai 's office called the blast an obvious assault on civilians and said `` the perpetrators of this attack and those who planned it were vicious terrorists who killed innocent people for their malicious goals . '' About a year ago , another suicide car bomb detonated outside the embassy . Among the 58 people killed in the July 7 , 2008 , attack were two Indian diplomats and 14 students at a nearby school . More than 100 were wounded in that blast . Afghan and Indian officials accused Pakistan 's spy agency of involvement in that attack . Pakistan denied the accusation . India is the sixth largest donor to Afghanistan , providing millions of dollars to help with reconstruction efforts there .

{"answer":"London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three one-time insiders at the defunct News of the World tabloid testified Monday before a British government-backed panel investigating press ethics and behavior . Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck -- who has been arrested in connection with a police probe into phone hacking -- said he would not talk about illegal eavesdropping because of the arrest . He has not been charged . He appeared at the Leveson Inquiry after the paper 's most famous undercover reporter , Mazher Mahmoud , known as the `` fake sheikh '' for the disguise he often adopted to get stories . He described doing stories on prostitution and drug dealing , but insisted repeatedly the tabloid `` never engaged in entrapment . '' He defended his methodology , saying criminals had gone to prison because of his work . `` Exposing criminality gives me great satisfaction , '' said Mahmoud , whose appearance was not televised in order to protect his identity . But he said he had never heard about phone hacking by the News of the World until royal reporter Clive Goodman was arrested for it in 2006 . The inquiry was prompted by widespread public outrage this summer at the revelation that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered 13-year-old girl in 2002 . Murdoch 's son James , the chief executive of the News Corporation subsidiary that published the tabloid , has repeatedly denied knowing about the scale of illegal eavesdropping at his papers . James Murdoch ordered the paper shut down over the scandal . Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis also testified Monday . Like Thurlbeck , he has been arrested and released on bail in a police investigation into phone hacking . He argued that Britain 's downmarket tabloids were the `` ones that people out there want to read , '' and far outsold so-called quality papers such as the Guardian and the Times . A former News of the World journalist testified last month that the editors of the tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories . Paul McMullan named Andy Coulson , who went on to become an adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron , and Rebekah Brooks , a Murdoch protege , as editors who were aware of the practice . Coulson resigned as editor of the tabloid in 2007 when Goodman went to prison for hacking the voice mails of Prince William 's staff , and he later became Cameron 's communications director . Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking , saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff . The Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures since last month , including celebrities such as `` Harry Potter '' author J.K. Rowling and actor Hugh Grant , both of whom complained about press intrusion into their lives . Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people , including celebrities , crime victims , politicians and members of the royal family , were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories . It involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Friday marks the passage of one month since a magnitude-7 .0 earthquake devastated Haiti . As thousands of Haitians gathered in the center of Port-au-Prince to remember what was lost that day , Ann Veneman , executive director of UNICEF , spoke to CNN 's `` American Morning '' about the situation . `` We do n't know how many actually were orphaned by the earthquake . There are so many children in Haiti without parental supervision who need to be cared for , who need to be fed , clothed and so forth and protected , '' she said . Tracking down the actual numbers in Haiti can be tough given the circumstances . Fact check : One month after the earthquake , what numbers are available to tell the story of devastation and recovery ? \u2022 Human toll : The Haitian government says the quake claimed the lives of more than 212,000 people and injured more than 300,000 . The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates that 3 million people were affected by the quake and 700,000 in Port-au-Prince were displaced . \u2022 Aid agencies : The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that more than 400 agencies were registered with the Haitian government to do work in Haiti before the quake . Because some of the non-governmental organizations are small and work in remote , rural areas , their presence may not even be known to the Haitian government . \u2022 Aid given : According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office , more than 2.3 million people have received food aid from the World Food Programme and their partners , and more than 10,300 mosquito nets , 23,000 family tents , 26,500 kitchen sets and 79,500 blankets have been distributed . \u2022 Sanitation : The World Health Organization estimated this week that less than 5 percent of the need for latrines has been meet . However , there has not been an increase in reported infectious diseases . More than 900,000 people have access to safe drinking water , but that still falls short of the goal of providing water to 1.1 million . \u2022 Children : About 5,000 schools were destroyed or damaged in the quake . According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office , the Haitian government aims to have all schools open again before the end of March . Kathleen Strottman , executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute , estimates that there were more than 900 orphans in the process of being adopted into American homes when the quake struck .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos began their `` supervised release '' Friday after President Bush commuted their sentences in January for convictions related to the shooting of a Mexican drug smuggler . Ignacio Ramos has been out of prison since Febrary after serving time in the shooting of an illegal immigrant . Ramos and Compean were able to remove their electronic monitoring devices and leave their homes in El Paso , Texas , on Friday for the first time since they left prison in February . After spending two `` hard , long , lonely '' years in prison , the two said they were looking forward to spending time with their families and putting this chapter of their lives behind them . `` There are more important things than the people that have done this to us or what we have gone through and I am not going to sit here and dwell on that , '' Ramos said in an interview with CNN 's `` Lou Dobbs Tonight . '' `` We are looking ahead . We 're optimistic for a very good future and that 's what 's more important , '' Ramos said . Their release in February marked a significant turning point in a case that served as a flash point in the debate over immigration and border security . The two were sentenced in 2006 to 11 - and 12-year sentences stemming from the February 2005 shooting of Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila near the U.S.-Mexico border south of El Paso , Texas . Critics of U.S. immigration policy rushed to the agents ' defense , saying they were merely doing their jobs . Civil liberties advocates argued that Compean and Ramos used excessive force . Ramos credited the outside support with helping him win clemency and keeping his spirits up during his imprisonment . `` Members from Congress were speaking about us , people writing us constantly , it felt so good to know that people did n't give up on us and that people constantly believed in us , '' he said . `` How can you give up when people are n't giving up on you ? '' Compean echoed his sentiments , saying he was shocked to this day over the support he received . `` I did n't expect it . I expected people to really forget all about us once we turned ourselves in , '' he said . Like Ramos , Compean said the most difficult part of going to prison was leaving behind his wife and children . `` I think that 's been the hardest . When I turned myself in , my son was 4 months old , '' he said . `` There 's really nothing special I want to do . The only thing I 'm really looking forward to is getting out of the house and going out to dinner with my wife and going to the park with my sons , '' Compean said . Their legal cases are far from over . The convictions still stand and the two remain felons while appeals are pending , which means they can not contact one another or reapply for their jobs , something Ramos said he would like to do . Ramos shot Aldrete-Davila in the buttocks after he ditched a vehicle carrying more than 700 pounds of marijuana and fled on foot toward Mexico . The agents said during trial that Aldrete-Davila had brandished a gun while resisting arrest , but Aldrete-Davila said he was unarmed and trying to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun . `` In exchange for immunity , Aldrete-Davila agreed to cooperate with the investigation of the shooting , and he returned to the United States so that the bullet could be removed from his body , '' according to court documents . Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon , lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila 's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure . Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , a vocal critic of the decision to grant Aldrete-Davila immunity , said several key pieces of evidence were withheld from the jury that convicted Ramos and Compean . The jury , for instance , never learned that Aldrete-Davila was running drugs at the time of the shooting . Nor did jurors learn that Aldrete-Davila breached his immunity agreement by continuing to smuggle drugs into the United States , Cornyn has said . `` Several jurors have since come forward to state that if they had been told about the excluded evidence , they would have changed their verdict , '' Cornyn wrote in a January plea to Bush , requesting clemency for the agents . Despite Ramos ' and Compean 's appeals for clemency , a senior Bush administration official said the men were `` convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law . '' Leading Democrats and Republicans , however , supported Bush 's commutation , the official said . `` The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they and their families have suffered enough for their crimes , '' the official said .","question":""}

One of Target 's two new Hawaii stores awaits its Sunday grand opening . The stores ' openings will come just weeks after the retailer cut 600 people from its headquarters staff amid what it called weaker-than-expected sales . The retailer will hold grand openings for the 21 general merchandise stores and six full-grocery SuperTarget stores on Sunday . The new sites include the company 's first two stores in Hawaii . Each general merchandise store employs 150 to 250 people , and each SuperTarget has 200 to 300 workers , the company said . In late January , Minnesota-based Target cut its headquarters staff by 9 percent and eliminated 400 open positions . The company , citing difficult economic conditions and sales that did n't meet expectations , also said it would soon close an Arkansas distribution center that employs 500 people and would cut back on planned new-store openings . `` We are clearly operating in an unprecedented economic environment that requires us to make some extremely difficult decisions to ensure Target remains competitive over the long term , '' Gregg Steinhafel , Target president and CEO , said in a news release that month . Retailers in the United States took a hit last year as a weak economy weighed on consumer spending . Retail sales fell six straight months until January , when sales rose 1 percent , according to the Commerce Department . However , retail experts said they were skeptical a rebound had taken hold . Still , two other retailers also announced plans to expand .

He said Cammarano 's letter of resignation , delivered to the city clerk at 9:15 a.m. , said his resignation would be effective at noon Friday . The Democratic Hoboken mayor was one of 44 people arrested in last week 's federal corruption probe . In his letter to the city clerk , Cammarano , 32 , denied all criminal wrongdoing , but said the charges have disrupted the city government and his ability to perform mayoral duties . `` It had been my hope and expectation that I could remain in office and perform my official duties until I had the opportunity to resolve the legal charges against me in court , '' he wrote . `` Regrettably , it has turned out that the controversy surrounding the charges against me has become a distraction to me and an impediment to functioning of Hoboken government . '' He apologized to Hoboken residents for the `` disruption and disappointment '' the case has caused , but said , `` I am innocent of any criminal charges and I intend to fight the allegations against me . '' Authorities said that 29 public officials and associates took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes , and that 15 people -- including five rabbis -- engaged in money laundering .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chelsea struck a major blow in the English Premier League title race with a controversial 2-1 victory over champions Manchester United on Saturday that put the London club two points clear at the top of the table with five matches to play . Carlo Ancelotti 's team traveled to Old Trafford to face a side reeling from the loss of injured England star Wayne Rooney following the midweek European Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich . The Italian coach opted to leave his own key forward Didier Drogba on the substitutes ' bench , but the Ivory Coast international scored a decisive goal with 11 minutes to play despite being clearly offside . United boss Alex Ferguson was left fuming at the decision . `` What I ca n't understand is the linesman 's directly in front of it . He has no-one near him and he gets it wrong , '' the Scot told Sky Sports . `` A game of that magnitude , you really need quality officials and we did n't get them today . It was a poor , poor performance . `` Five games left , they 're two points ahead and four goals better than us -- they 're in the driving seat . Chelsea are favorites now , there 's no question . I 'm certain we 'll respond but we could win the next five games and not win it . '' United hit back with a late bundled goal from young substitute Federico Macheda , which television replays showed came off the Italian 's arm , but Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov could not convert a chance to equalize in time added on . Chelsea , who had scored 12 goals in the two previous matches and did not have to play in midweek following last month 's Champions League exit against Inter Milan , started the game in dominant form . Man of the match Florent Malouda set up the opening goal in the 20th minute , with the France winger surging past Darren Fletcher into the penalty area and providing a low cross that England midfielder Joe Cole cheekily backheeled past goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar . Both teams had penalty claims turned down before halftime , and Berbatov missed United 's first real chance with a header after an hour . Drogba replaced Nicolas Anelka in the 69th minute , and 10 minutes later he had the ball in the net after collecting a pass from fellow substitute Salomon Kalou despite being further forward than United 's last two defenders . United pulled a goal back with nine minutes to play as substitute Nani broke down the left and his cross rebounded off goalkeeper Petr Cech , onto Macheda and into the Chelsea net , with visiting captain John Terry appealing in vain for handball . Berbatov , who started on his own up front in place of Rooney , then tamely volleyed Gary Neville 's cross into the arms of Cech as Chelsea held on for a deserved victory . Third-placed Arsenal kept their title hopes alive with a last-gasp 1-0 victory at 10-man Wolverhampton which left Arsene Wenger 's team three points behind London rivals Chelsea . Wolves had captain Karl Henry sent off for a foul on Tomas Rosicky in the 66th minute , but Arsenal could not take advantage until deep into injury-time when substitute striker Nicklas Bendtner headed in Bacary Sagna 's cross . Manchester City moved up to fourth place above Tottenham with a 6-1 thrashing of Burnley in Saturday 's late match that left their near neighbors deep in relegation trouble . Roberto Mancini 's team were 4-0 up after 20 minutes , and led 6-0 before an hour had been played as Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice along with goals from fellow strikers Craig Bellamy and Carlos Tevez . Patrick Vieira and Vincent Kompany were also on target before Steven Fletcher 's 71st-minute consolation for the home side . Tottenham 's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League took a big blow with a 3-1 defeat at Sunderland , for whom the London club 's former striker Darren Bent scored twice -- the first after only 36 seconds and the second from the penalty spot . England World Cup hopeful Bent also had two spot-kicks saved by Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes as he took his tally to 23 for the season . Sunderland also had a goal disallowed as Steve Bruce 's team consolidated 13th place , a comfortable 11 points clear of the bottom three . Aston Villa bounced back from the 7-1 thrashing at Chelsea with a 1-0 win at Bolton to join sixth-placed Liverpool -- who travel to Birmingham on Sunday -- on 54 points . England international Ashley Young fired an 11th-minute winner to leave Bolton five points above the relegation zone . Stoke moved up to 10th with a 2-0 victory that left Hull in the bottom three , equal on points with West Ham , who travel to Everton on Sunday . Jamaica forward Ricardo Fuller gave Stoke a sixth-minute lead , and Hull were reduced to 10 minutes after Dutch midfielder George Boateng was carried off after being kicked in the head before Liam Lawrence scored a late second . Bottom club Portsmouth delayed their inevitable relegation with a 0-0 draw at home to Blackburn despite having defender Anthony Van den Borre sent off with half an hour to play . Avram Grant 's team would have gone down if they had lost and Hull had won .","question":""}
{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man accused of attempting to set off a car bomb in Times Square considered other targets in and around New York before the failed attack , an investigator said . Faisal Shahzad , 30 , pondered attacks on Rockefeller Center , Grand Central Terminal , the World Financial Center and Connecticut helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky , going so far as to case some of the targets , a senior counterterrorism official with oversight of the investigation said Tuesday . Dressed in a gray sweatsuit , free of handcuffs , Shahzad appeared before a federal magistrate on Tuesday afternoon to hear the charges against him . As he walked into courtroom , Shahzad gave a slight smile to his public defender , Julia Gatto . At the end of the hearing , Gatto requested that Shahzad be served halal food -- prepared according to Islamic dietary laws -- while jailed . Gatto did not object to the government 's request that he remain in federal custody . He did not enter a plea , and Magistrate Judge James Francis set his next hearing for June 1 . Shahzad faces five counts in connection with the attempted bombing in Times Square on May 1 . He could face life in prison if convicted . The Pakistani-born naturalized U.S. citizen has been in federal custody since his arrest two days after the bomb attempt . During that time , he `` has provided valuable intelligence from which further investigative action has been taken , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . After 15 days of questioning , Shahzad invoked his right to an attorney at Tuesday 's hearing , a federal law enforcement official said . According to court documents , Shahzad has admitted to law enforcement that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan . Attorney General Eric Holder has said Shahzad was working with the Pakistani Taliban . E-mails obtained by CNN indicate he was looking for a way to strike back against `` foreign infidel forces '' he believed were oppressing the Muslim world . In one , sent to a large group of recipients in February 2006 , Shahzad wrote , `` Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from the west . Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe . '' At the time , he had been in the United States for about six years , had earned his MBA and was working as a financial analyst in Connecticut . CIA Director Leon Panetta and National Security Adviser James Jones are traveling to Pakistan to meet with officials there about the status of the Times Square investigation , a U.S. official said Tuesday . They also plan to discuss efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks in their meetings there , the official added . The U.S. government wants to see continued Pakistani cooperation in determining what role the Pakistani Taliban may have played in assisting Shahzad . Washington also wants an aggressive push by Pakistani authorities to take action against al Qaeda-linked groups in the largely ungoverned tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan .

Ricin was found in a room in this Las Vegas , Nevada , extended-stay hotel in February , police say . Roger Bergendorff was taken into custody Wednesday morning in Las Vegas , Nevada , Kolko said . Bergendorff , 57 , was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as ricin exposure after the agent was discovered in his hotel room off the Las Vegas Strip . Tests conducted by the FBI determined that the substance contained 2.9 percent active ricin . Its preparation was characterized as `` crude , '' according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Las Vegas . According to a press release from the Department of Justice office , a search of Bergendorff 's hotel room turned up `` an ` Anarchist 's Cookbook , ' a collection of instructions on poisons and other dangerous recipes , including instructions on the preparation of ricin , '' two semiautomatic pistols , a rifle and a pistol with a silencer . `` FBI searches of Salt Lake City -LSB- Utah -RSB- storage units rented by Von Bergendorff resulted in the discovery of castor beans , various chemicals used in the production of ricin , a respirator , filters , painter 's mask , laboratory glassware , syringes and a notebook on ricin production , '' the Justice Department release said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk . John Demjanjuk , shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal , is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp . The decision by the Department of Justice 's Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church , Virginia , clears the way for Demjanjuk 's deportation to Germany , where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor , a Nazi death camp in Poland . The deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history , while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial . Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany , a board official said . The appeals board rejected Demjanjuk 's emergency stay request because it concluded `` there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted , '' according to board officials . The pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk , 89 , to Germany would constitute torture . `` In the four years since his deportation was -LSB- initially -RSB- ordered , his health has seriously deteriorated , '' Demjanjuk 's attorney , John Broadley , told CNN in a recent telephone interview . Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia , kidney problems , spinal problems and `` a couple of types of gout . '' The board , however , has already signaled that argument will be rejected . Demjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals , though his chances of getting the board 's ruling overturned are believed to be slim , according to Justice Department officials . Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley 's argument for his client . `` He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor , '' Hier said . Hier called Demjanjuk 's comparison of his planned deportation to torture `` preposterous coming from a person that served the -LSB- Nazi organization -RSB- S.S. in a death camp . It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust . '' Hier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp , and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless . `` You were there for one job : kill the Jews , '' he said . `` And that 's what they did full-time . '' He called the evidence against Demjanjuk `` overwhelming . '' German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943 . They studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations , and concluded it was genuine , before issuing the warrant . Demjanjuk , a retired autoworker living in Cleveland , Ohio , has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades . He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel , where he was convicted in 1986 of being `` Ivan the Terrible , '' a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp . The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal , and he returned to the United States . The United States filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard . He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court . Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian , says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans . CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Homegrown terrorism will be part of the United States ' National Security Strategy for the first time , according to President Barack Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , who called it a new phase of the terrorist threat . When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy on Thursday , it will be the first time any president `` explicitly recognizes the threat to the United States posed by individuals radicalized here at home , '' National Security Adviser John Brennan said Wednesday . The strategy acts as a blueprint for how a White House administration intends to protect Americans . In the past , it has focused mostly on international threats . But a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document , Brennan said . Earlier this month , Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York 's bustling district of Times Square . U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November . Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi , an Afghan national , pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system . And David Headley , an American citizen from Chicago , Illinois , is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai , India , terrorist attacks that killed 160 people . `` We 've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes , '' Brennan said . `` We have seen individuals , including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports , travel easily to extremist safe havens , return to America , their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement . '' Brennan , who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9\/11 , al Qaeda has shown itself to be a `` resilient , resourceful and determined enemy . '' Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training , attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks . `` They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense , '' Brennan said . `` As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics , so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours . '' Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president 's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates , but said it `` will require a broad , sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power , military and civilian , kinetic and diplomatic .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As news of the much-awaited release of Myanmar Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi reverberated throughout the world , activists and world leaders were seizing the opportunity to make a case for democracy and human rights in this besieged nation . Myanmar -- formerly known as Burma -- has been ruled by a Marxist military junta since 1962 . The military regime has cracked down on political dissidents , forcing thousands to flee . In a statement released Saturday , President Barack Obama called Suu Kyi a personal `` hero '' and called for the military regime to `` release all political prisoners , not just one . '' `` The United States looks forward to the day when all of Burma 's people are free from fear and persecution , '' Obama said in Saturday 's statement . Suu Kyi : ` I 'm very happy to see you again ' `` Following Aung San Suu Kyi 's powerful example , we recommit ourselves to remaining steadfast advocates of freedom and human rights for the Burmese people and accountability for those who continue to oppress them , '' he said . The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said while Suu Kyi 's release is a `` positive signal , '' Pillay urged the military regime to also release the remaining political prisoners still detained . `` I urge the authorities of Myanmar to now release the other 2,200 political prisoners as a clear sign that the new government intends to respect human rights and forge a new future for the country , '' she said . British Prime Minister David Cameron also said Suu Kyi was an `` inspiration '' and that the military regime must uphold its decision . `` Her detention was a travesty , designed only to silence the voice of the Burmese people , '' he said . European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called for the `` unconditional release '' of all detained dissidents and said Suu Kyi 's freedom should be unrestricted . `` This is the only way to ensure that the Myanmar elections of 7 November are the start of a real transition to democracy , '' Barroso said Saturday . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was `` thrilled '' by news of Suu Kyi 's release . `` People who love freedom everywhere admire her and the long sacrifice she has made for her people , '' he said . `` In light of recent elections , I also hope that Aung San Suu Kyi 's release will lead to the rapid inclusion of her and the Burmese citizens in governance , '' he said . Former first lady Laura Bush and former President George Bush called for Suu Kyi 's release to be unconditional . `` We strongly support the aspirations of the Burmese people and their demands for basic human rights : freedom of speech , worship , and assembly , '' said Bush . In Asia , Australia 's Prime Minister Julia Gillard called Suu Kyi 's detention `` completely unjustified '' and said her government is lobbying for an opportunity to meet with her personally . `` Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd said the government was seeking an early opportunity to speak with Aung San Suu Kyi , to convey Australia 's support for her and her struggle for democracy in Burma , '' Gillard said . `` We will closely monitor her situation , including any restrictions imposed on her freedom of movement or association . Australia continues to call on the Burmese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the more than 2000 political prisoners still detained in Burma , '' she said . China 's official Xinhua news agency was less exuberant with words on Saturday . China has refrained from publicly pressuring Myanmar and has remained the Marxist regime 's closest ally since the military coup 20 years ago . India has also been criticized by the United States and others for not voicing opposition to the military junta . When India accorded a red-carpet welcome in July to the top leader of Myanmar 's military junta , there was little mention of human rights abuses allegedly taking place in Myanmar 's prisons , critics claimed . Human rights advocates and Suu Kyi followers overseas still expressed concerns not only for repercussions of her release , but the situation of the prisoners still incarcerated . Burma Campaign UK warned that her release should not be seen as the final return of democracy in Burma and also called for the release of prisoners . `` The release of Aung San Suu Kyi is about public relations , not democratic reform , '' said Zoya Phan , International Coordinator at Burma Campaign UK in a statement released Saturday . `` I am thrilled to see our democracy leader free at last , but the release is not part of any political process , instead it is designed to get positive publicity for the dictatorship after the blatant rigging of elections on 7th November . We must not forget the thousands of other political prisoners still suffering in Burma 's jails . '' In Saturday 's statement , Phan and the Burma Campaign UK recalled previous incidents in which her release was widely broadcast but did not come through . `` It is the third time Aung San Suu Kyi has been released from house arrest , '' the statement said . `` The last time she was released , in 2002 , it was part of a U.N.-led initiative to try to persuade Burma 's dictatorship to enter into dialogue leading to a transition to democracy . However , when the time came for substantive discussions the dictatorship refused to continue the dialogue . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States imposed stiff sanctions against Iran on Thursday , targeting two Iranian military groups and a number of Iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities . `` What this means is that no U.S. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities , '' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said . `` In addition , any assets that these designees have under U.S. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen . '' Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on Thursday morning . Rice accused Iran of `` pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon ; building dangerous ballistic missiles ; supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories ; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations , threatening to wipe Israel off the map . '' Watch Rice tell why sanctions are being imposed '' `` Many of the Iranian regime 's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies : the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or the IRGC , and the Quds force , an arm of the IRGC , '' she said . She said the sanctions were being imposed `` because of the Revolutionary Guard 's support for proliferation and the Quds force support for terrorism . '' The United States also designated three Iranian state-owned banks for sanctions , two of them `` for their involvement in proliferation activities '' and the other `` as a terrorist financier , '' Rice said . `` Iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists , '' Paulson said . `` Iran 's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls . '' The Revolutionary Guard Corps , he said , `` is so deeply entrenched in Iran 's economy and commercial enterprises , it is increasingly likely that , if you are doing business with Iran , you are doing business '' with the corps . `` We call on responsible banks and companies around the world to terminate any business with Bank Melli , Bank Mellat , Bank Saderat , and all companies and entities '' of the corps , Paulson said . The move marks the first time the United States has attempted to punish another country 's military through sanctions . Previous sanctions imposed by the United States have been tied to Iran 's nuclear program . The United States has been working with other world powers to halt what they believe is Iran 's intent to develop a nuclear arsenal . Iran says it is pursuing nuclear power for peaceful reasons . Mohamed ElBaradei , director-general of the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency , said last month that Iran 's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful use and criticized U.S. rhetoric regarding Iran . The Quds Force is blamed by the U.S. military for training and arming Shiite militias in Iraq and smuggling highly lethal explosives into Iraq , where they are used to attack coalition forces . Iran denies the charge . `` If the Iranian government fulfills its international obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activity , I will join my British , French , Russian , Chinese and German colleagues , and I will meet with my Iranian counterpart any time , anywhere , '' Rice said . `` We will be open to the discussion of any issue . But if Iran 's rulers choose to continue down a path of confrontation , the United States will act with the international community to resist these threats of the Iranian regime . '' Last month , representatives of world powers announced that unless a November report shows a `` positive outcome '' of talks with Iran about its uranium enrichment program , they will move ahead with plans for a resolution imposing additional sanctions on the country . The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran suspend enrichment of uranium and has imposed limited sanctions on Tehran for refusing to comply .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Bush administration hailed North Korea 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with South Korea , China , Japan and Russia . Workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear facility this year . In fact , North Korea 's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing North Korea 's nuclear program . As a result of Pyongyang 's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and Friday 's expected destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon -- President Bush ordered some sanctions against North Korea lifted and instructed the State Department to remove the reclusive communist nation from U.S. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism . But as important as what the document says is what it does n't say . There is no mention of how many weapons North Korea has or where they are hidden . Nor did North Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with Syria . Both issues are reduced in the declaration to `` concerns '' Pyongyang promises to address down the road . Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check North Korea 's claims . And North Korea has promised to allow U.S. inspectors access to the Yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts . But it is far from clear whether Pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the United States will need to get a complete picture of North Korea 's program . Congressional Republicans not so sure about Pyongyang The stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative Republicans . Once considered President Bush 's strongest allies in confronting North Korea 's nuclear ambition , they feel that the Bush administration has let North Korea off the hook , especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to Syria . Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Florida , the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee , expressed `` profound disappointment '' over Bush 's announcement that North Korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism . And Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R-Michigan , the top Republican on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , accused President Bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success . `` A decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the White House to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of North Korea 's nuclear efforts , '' Hoekstra said . `` Lifting sanctions and removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures . '' Rep. Ed Royce , R-California , called North Korea 's declaration late and incomplete , alleging that North Korea built a nuclear facility for Syria , considered a terrorist state by the United States , while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing . That , he said , was proof that Pyongyang ca n't be trusted . `` How do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have ? '' Royce asked . `` This is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up . '' Democrats , who once criticized Bush for not talking directly to North Korea about its nuclear program , are cautiously supportive of the deal . Howard Berman , the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , called the North 's submission of a declaration `` encouraging . '' Even former presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , praised the Bush administration , saying `` engaging our enemies can pay dividends . '' But Kerry added , `` historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage North Korea before Pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons , tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them . '' Are we headed down the same road with Iran ? In his 2002 State of the Union address , Bush termed Iraq , North Korea and Iran the `` axis of evil , '' saying they were `` arming to threaten the peace of the world . '' Fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator Saddam Hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- U.S. forces invaded Iraq . But no such program was found , nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction . More than five years into the war , the United States is still battling al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents there . Six-party talks with North Korea began in 2003 , after North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Progress was limited until 2007 , when North Korea agreed to shut down Yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification . Progress has been even more limited for the third member of the `` axis of evil , '' Iran . The Bush administration has joined the other members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain , France , China and Russia , along with Germany -- in offering Iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones North Korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program . But the United States has refused to sit down with Iran until that suspension takes place . The U.N. Security Council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against Iran , and the United States has worked with some success to isolate Iran from the international financial community . But unlike North Korea , which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid , Iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the Middle East . And it 's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket . And Iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new U.S. president . Sen. Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee , has pledged to engage Iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions . Sen. John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , has taken a much tougher line , refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran . With the coming change in the U.S. administration , U.S. officials , diplomats and other Iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the United States and Iran could seriously think about talking . Meanwhile , by its own admission , Iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology . If the North Korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next U.S. president , that lesson may well be that the longer the United States waits to talk to Iran , the higher the cost will be to get Tehran out of the nuclear business .","question":""}
{"answer":"Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators believe the suspected gunman in last week 's massacre at Fort Hood acted alone , but his communications had been flagged by U.S. intelligence agencies in late 2008 , the FBI said Monday . The suspect , Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , remained in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas . In a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation so far `` indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . '' Thursday 's shooting left 13 dead , 12 of them U.S. soldiers , and 42 wounded . Read more about the victims Hasan , a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997 . He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon , but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military . A Muslim , he had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . In August , he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read `` Allah is Love '' was torn off . A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint . But the FBI disclosed that Hasan came to its attention as part of an unrelated terrorism probe in December 2008 , when agents reviewed `` certain communications between Maj. Hasan and the subject of that investigation . '' The intercepts `` raised no red flags , '' with no mention of threats or violence that would have triggered a U.S. terrorism investigation , senior investigative officials said Monday . Hasan , 39 , was wounded several times during the attack . Though still in intensive care , his ventilator was removed over the weekend , and he began talking afterwards , hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said . Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday , but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney , the investigative officials said . U.S. military officials said intelligence agencies intercepted communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki , a former imam at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church , Virginia , a Washington suburb . Al-Awlaki , who left the United States in 2002 and is believed to be living in Yemen , was the subject of several federal investigations dating back to the late 1990s , but was never charged . Military officials told CNN on Monday that intelligence agencies intercepted communications from Hasan to al-Awlaki and shared them with other U.S. government agencies . But federal authorities dropped the inquiry into Hasan 's communications after deciding that the messages warranted no further action , one of the officials said . According to the FBI , investigators from one of its Joint Terrorism Task Forces determined `` that the content of those communications was consistent with research being conducted by Maj. Hasan in his position as a psychiatrist at the Walter Reed Medical Center -LSB- in Washington -RSB- . '' Hasan was first an intern , then a resident and finally a fellow at Walter Reed before moving to Fort Hood . `` Because the content of the communications was explainable by his research and nothing else derogatory was found , the JTTF concluded that Maj. Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or terrorist planning , '' it said . FBI Director Robert Mueller has ordered a review of the matter , the FBI said . The independent commission that investigated the 9\/11 attacks found al-Awlaki was a `` spiritual adviser '' to two of the hijackers in that plot , Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Midhar , while al-Awlaki was at the Virginia mosque and earlier , in San Diego . The commission report said it was not clear whether the imam knew al-Hazmi and al-Midhar were involved in the hijacking plot , but security experts have described him as a radical Islamic fundamentalist who was `` very supportive of terrorists in the past , '' former White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend told CNN . An online post attributed to al-Awlaki praised Hasan as a hero for the Fort Hood attack , saying he `` could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people . '' But the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque denounced al-Awlaki 's remarks , and its current imam said he was stunned to hear Hasan was the suspect in the rampage . `` The quiet , very peaceful person coming in and out of the mosque , I could n't believe he could have done this , '' Sheikh Shaker Elsayed told CNN . Three senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation , told reporters in Washington that Hasan was never nominated to be on a watch list . He was able to purchase weapons legally and had done nothing to justify even a preliminary investigation , they said . In addition , Hasan had a security clearance at the `` secret '' level and received good performance reviews , they said . Nonetheless , they continued to examine his communications with the cleric in Yemen for several months as a precaution . Authorities have not identified a motive in Thursday 's attack . But at Fort Hood the post commander told reporters he has ordered his officers to `` immediately take a hard look and make sure if there 's anybody out there struggling . '' `` Hasan was a soldier and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has , '' Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said . `` We have to look across our entire formation , not just in a medical community but really look hard to our right and left . That 's the responsibility for everybody from the top to the bottom to make sure we 're taking care of our own . '' Army officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about Hasan 's motive , warning about a possible backlash against Muslim soldiers . But several witnesses , like Pvt. Robert Foster , who was wounded in the hip during the attack , reported Hasan shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' -- Arabic for `` God is great '' -- which Islamic terrorists have used as a battle cry . `` I was sitting in about the second row back when the assailant stood up and yelled ` Allah Akbar ' in Arabic and he opened fire , '' Foster , 21 , said Monday on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' The Army leadership at Fort Hood will `` take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this , '' Cone said Monday . `` I think what we 're looking for are sort of people with overwhelming personal problems and patterns of behavior that are not at all related to religion , '' Cone said . No charges have been filed against Hasan . The investigative officials who briefed reporters said he was likely to be charged in the military court system . President Obama will speak at Tuesday 's memorial service for the shooting victims at Fort Hood , and will meet with victims ' families , his spokesman said . `` The president will meet with families of those that lost a loved one last week , as well as speak to the larger memorial that will take place at the base , '' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in his daily briefing Monday . First lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president on the trip , Gibbs said . Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also participate in the memorial service , but he will not speak , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This month the U.S. government has introduced major changes that will affect millions of travelers to the U.S. who do not need a visa . Instead of filling in the green visa waiver form en route , short-term visitors must register their details online at least three days before they depart . The measure is designed tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. . The new system , known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization -LRB- ESTA -RRB- , does not become compulsory until January 12 , 2009 . But travelers are urged to prepare for the new rules in advance . ESTA applies to citizens from the 27 Visa Waiver Program -LRB- VWP -RRB- countries that includes most of western Europe in addition to New Zealand , Japan , Brunei and Australia . Visitors are recommended to submit applications no later than 72 hours before departure in case further inquiry is necessary . But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assured travelers that the system can handle last-minute and emergency requests . Applications can be made at any time , even if travelers have no specific travel plans . And if itineraries change , information can be easily updated on the ESTA Web site . Once travelers are authorized , they can travel for up to two years or until their passport expires , whichever comes first . From mid-January , travelers who have not received approval may be denied boarding , delayed processing , or denied admission at a U.S. port of entry . Passengers must submit the same information that is currently required in the I-94 immigration form . This includes biographical data , travel information as well as questions regarding communicable diseases , arrests and convictions . Registration is possible through the U.S. government ESTA Web site . In most cases , eligibility for travel will be approved immediately . Applicants who receive an `` Authorization Pending '' response will need to check the Web site for updates . Applicants whose ESTA applications are denied will be referred to Travel.State.Gov for information on how to apply for a visa . ESTA does not change the rules for citizens from countries that require visas . But the U.S. is due to extend the visa waiver program and has signed agreements with eight countries including the Czech Republic , Hungary and South Korea . Travelers are advised that ESTA does not guarantee entry into the United States . The final decision rests with the immigration official at the port of entry .","question":""}

{"answer":"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Italian newspaper and magazine published excerpts of what they said were audio recordings of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi talking with an escort at the center of a corruption probe . Veronica Lario , the wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , pictured , filed for divorce in May . The daily La Repubblica and its sister magazine L'Espresso said the recordings posted on their Web sites Monday were of Berlusconi and Patrizia D'Addario . She has said that an Italian businessman hired her and other women to attend parties at Berlusconi 's homes . In June , D'Addario told CNN that she had turned the tapes over to a prosecutor in Bari , southern Italy . Through her attorney , she refused to comment on the authenticity of the excerpts released Monday . But in a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA , Berlusconi lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister is challenging the `` truthfulness and legality '' of the recordings . `` We can only regard the material as worthless , completely false and the result of invention , '' Ghedini said . `` In any case , the act of its publication is an illegal act in itself , which will need to be pursued , and all legal actions will be taken against any body who publishes such material . '' Berlusconi , the 72-year-old media mogul-turned-prime minister , has denied the allegations . According to La Repubblica , the conversation between D'Addario and Berlusconi took place in October and November at the prime minister 's house in Rome . It also published an excerpt of what it said was a conversation between D'Addario and Gianpaulo Tarantini , the businessman accused of hiring D'Addario and other escorts . Prosecutors in Bari , in southern Italy , are investigating allegations that Tarantini bribed health officials to buy prosthetics and other medical supplies from a company he and his brother own . Tarantini has denied any wrongdoing and says he brought women to the parties to make a `` beautiful impression . '' `` I have never paid money to those who accompanied me except for refunding their trip expenses , '' he said in a statement issued last month . `` I exclude that the premier could have been aware of these reimbursements and I want to ask forgiveness for having involuntarily damaged him . '' Berlusconi 's private life has been in the spotlight since his wife of 19 years , Veronica Lario , filed for divorce in May . The split followed reports that Berlusconi went to the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old girl , with whom Berlusconi has denied having an inappropriate relationship . And the Spanish newspaper El Pais has published what it said were photos of racy parties at Berlusconi 's villa on the island of Sardinia , including one picture that showed scantily clad women . But despite the swirl of scandal , Berlusconi remains popular , consistently scoring approval ratings well over 50 percent . CNN 's Hada Messia contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gunmen shot and killed 17 patients and wounded two others in a drug rehabilitation center in northern Mexico late Wednesday , the mayor of Ciudad Juarez said Thursday . Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , late Wednesday . Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said authorities believe a rival drug gang attacked the men at the El Aviane rehab facility . `` At the very least , it was one organized crime group thinking that another group was operating in that place , '' Reyes told CNN . Wednesday night 's shootings , he said , are similar to an attack at a drug facility in March that left 20 patients dead . A Mexican civic group said last week that Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas , had the most slayings per capita in 2008 of any city in the world . Watch scene at rehab center after shootings '' More than 1,420 people have been killed in Juarez this year , Reyes told CNN on Monday . About 1,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2008 , Reyes said . The latest Juarez killings came on the same day that gunmen shot dead the No. 2 security official and three others in Michoacan , the home state of Mexican President Felipe Calderon . Jose Manuel Revuelta Lopez , the deputy public safety secretary of Mexico 's Michoacan state , was killed in a shootout that also claimed the lives of two of his bodyguards and a bystander caught in the crossfire , said Jesus Humberto Adame Ortiz , spokesman for the state . Revuelta was leaving his office at 5:15 p.m. in the state capital , Morelia , when the shooting occurred , Adame said . An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since Calderon declared war on drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006 . More than 11,000 people have since died , about 1,000 of them police . The offensive against the government has been especially fierce in Michoacan . In July , La Familia Michoacana drug cartel was accused of assaults in a half-dozen cities across the state and of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents and dumping their bodies on a remote road . That violence was thought to have been retaliation for the arrest of a La Familia leader . In Juarez , much of the violence is being committed by the rival Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels , which are fighting for lucrative routes into the United States as well as local street sales , Reyes said . The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security , he said . In the past 45 days , 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years , Reyes said . `` We do n't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not , '' he told CNN . `` We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails . They end up in the city of Juarez , and that 's a problem generated for us , but also for the United States . '' Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally , but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs , which have networks in the United States , Reyes said . According to a report released last week by the Mexican Citizens Council for Public Security watchdog group , Juarez had an estimated rate of 130 killings per 100,000 people . The city has a population of around 1.5 million . By comparison , the homicide rate in New Orleans , Louisiana , the deadliest city in the United States in 2008 , was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents , based on preliminary FBI figures .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The captain and chief officer of a Chinese-registered ship that ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef will appear in an Australian court Thursday , charged with damaging the reef . The Shen Neng 1 veered more than 27 kilometers -LRB- 17 miles -RRB- off course and ended up on a shoal in the Reef on April 3 , prompting concerns of an oil spill near the world 's largest coral reef system . On Wednesday , the Australian Federal Police announced that they have arrested the 47-year-old Chinese master of the vessel and the 44-year-old chief officer . The captain was charged with liability for the vessel . He faces a maximum fine of A$ 55,000 -LRB- U.S. $ 50,852 -RRB- . The chief officer is accused of being on watch when the ship caused the damage . He faces up to three years in prison and a fine of A$ 220,000 -LRB- U.S. $ 203,411 -RRB- . Authorities did not disclose the name of either man . The ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to China from the Australian port of Gladstone when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef , just north of Great Keppel Island . About 950 tons of oil were on board . A small oil slick caused by the ship 's grounding did not threaten the Great Barrier Reef after crews sprayed dispersants on it and surface netting helped to contain it . Officials said the ship 's captain had a 10-mile-wide channel to navigate through in an area where pilots are n't needed -- a relatively wide open section of sea , 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- off shore and away from the larger mass of coral most people associate with the Great Barrier Reef . `` He got 15 nautical miles -LRB- 17.3 miles -RRB- off course , which is just outrageous , '' Adam Nicholson , a spokesman for Maritime Safety Queensland , said at the time . Nicholson likened it to a car veering off a 2-mile wide road . `` We have thousands of boats moving in that same space every year and nothing has ever happened like this , '' he said . The Great Barrier Reef is made up of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands spanning over 2,600 km -LRB- 1,600 miles -RRB- off the coast of Queensland in the Coral Sea .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Pennsylvania teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a Mexican immigrant dead last July . Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak 's joint trial began in late April in Schuykill County , Pennsylvania . Brandon Piekarsky , 17 , was sentenced to 6 to 23 months , and Derrick Donchak , 19 , received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25-year-old Luis Ramirez . Judge William Baldwin ordered the two to report to Schuylkill County jail on July 19 to begin serving their sentences . An all-white jury convicted the two former high school football players of misdemeanor simple assault at trial last month and acquitted them of felony counts , including aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension -- charges that carried lengthier sentences . In fashioning his sentence , Baldwin acknowledged the severity of the attack , which left Ramirez on life support for two days before he died , but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury 's verdict . `` This was n't any fight , this was a group of young athletes ganging up on one person . That 's not a street fight , '' Baldwin said , referring to the defense team 's characterization of the confrontation as a `` street fight . '' `` You picked out a guy who was n't one of you and beat the pulp out of him , '' Baldwin said . The incident divided the small , rural mining town of Shenandoah into camps for and against the boys as it became a flashpoint for racial tensions across the country . After the verdict , Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending that the Department of Justice pursue civil rights charges . `` The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted , beaten and killed because he was Mexican , '' Rendell said . `` Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance . '' During Wednesday 's sentencing , Baldwin said he was surprised that Rendell had chosen to speak out on the case and told the court that his sentence was not affected by the governor 's letter . Fred Fanelli , Piekarsky 's lawyer , said he felt the sentence was harsh , given the circumstances . The judge could have sentenced the teens to probation under Pennsylvania 's sentencing guidelines . `` I 'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months . Having said that , I 'm glad we finally have some finality with this case , '' Fanelli told CNN affiliate WBRE after the sentencing . Baldwin heard from several teachers , coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation . They urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults . Ramirez 's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants ' supporters . `` He was my one and only love , and they took him away from me , and they took my children 's father , '' Crystal Dillman said . `` Now I have to live without my best friend and love of my life . '' The court also heard a prepared statement from Ramirez 's mother , Elisa Zavala , who lives in Guanajuato , Mexico . `` I 'm not the same person as before , now I feel a great emptiness within my heart , '' she wrote . `` There are moments in which I 'm alone and I ask myself : What do I do now that I do n't have my son ? I feel that without him , I am no one . '' The judge also tacked on extra days to each boy 's sentence for consuming alcohol earlier in the evening . For providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight , Donchak was also convicted of corrupting minors . Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third-degree murder . Prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol-fueled brawl , which occurred on a residential street in Shenandoah the evening of July 12 . Prosecutors alleged that a group of teens , which included Piekarsky and Donchak , baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant . After the fight broke up , witnesses said Ramirez came back at the teens , who beat him so severely that , according to a medical testimony , brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital . Jurors heard from several teens who witnessed the incident but did not participate , as well as one teen who pleaded guilty in juvenile court and another whose case is being handled in federal court . The testimony painted a picture of confusion , with several inconsistencies as to who did what . Defense lawyers argued that Ramirez 's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias . They also suggested that Ramirez was responsible for triggering the second confrontation . Advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences , and called on the Department of Justice to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants . `` The meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress , '' said Gladys Limon , staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund . Citing FBI statistics , Limon said that hate crimes against Latinos have risen 40 percent in the last five years and called on Congress to strengthen hate crime laws . `` The failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the Ramirez family , but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future , '' she said . Richard Cohen , president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center , said the case had troubling implications in the wider context of race relations nationwide . `` Since the year 2000 , we 've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country , to a record 926 by our latest count , '' he said . `` The increase has been fueled by the same factor responsible for the rise in the anti-Latino hate crimes -- a backlash against the changing demographics of our country , a backlash fueled by politicians trolling for votes and pundits looking for ratings .

{"answer":"MYRTLE BEACH , South Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The top three Democratic presidential candidates face off in a Monday night debate in South Carolina , with the hearts and minds of African-American voters on the line . Sen. Barack Obama addresses Ebenezer Baptist Church , where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached . Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina share the stage at Myrtle Beach 's Palace Theatre as the nation honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday . The debate , put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute , comes five days before the Democratic primary in South Carolina , where almost half of the Democratic primary voters are African-Americans . These voters will be crucial to the outcome of Saturday 's primary in South Carolina . They now appear to be leaning heavily toward Obama , who if elected , would become the country 's first black president . Having a debate on Martin Luther King Jr. . Day in South Carolina `` is very fitting , '' said David Bohrman , CNN senior vice president and Washington bureau chief , who is executive producer of the debate . `` Perhaps a debate on Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina should be made a must-stop on the road to the White House every four years . '' A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama as the presidential nominee , with 31 percent supporting Clinton . That 's a major shift from October , when African-Americans backed Clinton over Obama , 57 percent to 33 percent . What appears to have changed is Obama 's electability . `` There 's been a huge shift among African-American Democrats from Clinton to Obama . African-American Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they did n't think a black man could be elected . Then Obama won Iowa and nearly won New Hampshire . Now they believe , '' Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst , said . `` Obama 's lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points , and among black women , once a Clinton stronghold , Obama has an 11-point advantage , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . Entrance polls from Saturday 's Nevada Democratic caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll . Eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Obama , with 14 percent supporting Clinton , who if elected , would become the country 's first woman to win the presidency . These kinds of numbers could spell trouble in South Carolina for Clinton , who 's coming off victories in the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses . But Clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community , thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former President Clinton with African-Americans . Both Democratic front-runners were reaching out to African-American voters Sunday . Obama , who often refers to King in his speeches , spoke at Atlanta , Georgia 's Ebenezer Baptist Church , where the late civil rights leader once preached . Watch Clinton , Obama reach out to black voters '' Obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against African-Americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community . `` And yet , if we are honest with ourselves , we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean . If we 're honest with ourselves , we 'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King 's vision of a beloved community , '' Obama said , citing homophobia , anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment . Obama told the congregation Sunday morning that if King could forgive his jailers , `` surely we can look past what divides us in our time . '' Obama 's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement Sunday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , which cited his `` appeal across many of the lines that have divided America , '' adding that `` both Clinton and Obama would make very good presidents , -LSB- but -RSB- Obama is the person ; this is his time . '' Georgia voters head to the polls February 5 . In New York , Hillary Clinton spent Sunday morning at another historic black church , Harlem 's Abyssinian Baptist Church , where she picked up the endorsement of its pastor , the Rev. Calvin Butts . Butts said outside the church : `` A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this community and this country that she has the experience to make things happen , and the vision to return us to a place of prosperity . '' Clinton also sounded a conciliatory note Sunday . `` I have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague Sen. Barack Obama . I am honored to be running with him , '' she said . `` I hope that this election remains focused on the big challenges that confront us . '' After a distant third-place finish in the Nevada caucuses , Edwards on Sunday made light of his performance . On CNN 's `` Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer , '' Edwards said he hopes `` what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas , '' admitting , `` I got my butt kicked . '' Edwards would like to rebound in South Carolina , his native state . He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House . But he 's running a distant third in most recent surveys in South Carolina , behind Obama and Clinton . On Sunday , Edwards sounded a cautious note , saying South Carolina was important but just one `` part of the long process . ... We will see how it goes . '' Also on `` Late Edition , '' the House majority whip , Rep. James Clyburn , D-South Carolina , cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks . Clyburn , the highest ranking African-American in Congress , was instrumental in having Monday 's debate held in South Carolina . `` When we were dealing with the dates of the primary , we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world , for that matter , to have this debate on Martin Luther King Jr. 's birthday celebration , '' Clyburn told Blitzer , who is the moderator of the event .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi had been on the run for months , as opposition fighters aided by NATO airstrikes pushed him and his supporters from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and other long-time strongholds . Finally , on Thursday , the long-time Libyan leader 's life ended around where it began -- in Sirte , the coastal city where he was born . Here is a timeline of some key moments leading up to Gadhafi 's death , according to Libya 's interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , other National Transitional Council officials and other sources : -- Having taken over the city of Bani Walid earlier in the week , fighters aligned with Libya 's National Transitional Council turn their attention on Sirte -- the last holdout of Gadhafi loyalists . -- French fighter jets and a Predator drone , firing a Hellfire missile , strike a convoy near Sirte on Thursday morning , a U.S. Defense official says . That official is unable to say if Gadhafi was in the targeted envoy . But a senior NATO official says that Gadhafi was part of that convoy and survived the attack . -- Around noon on Thursday , transitional council officials announce that their fighters have taken control of Sirte , despite pockets of resistance . There is no official word then about Gadhafi . -- During the day Thursday , Gadhafi is captured alive and in good health in Sirte , according to the interim prime minster . -- According to Ali Aujali , Libya 's ambassador to the United States , troops find Gadhafi during the day in a large drainage pipe in Sirte .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President-elect Barack Obama plans to nominate New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson to be secretary of commerce , a Democratic source told CNN on Tuesday . New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination this year . The former Democratic presidential candidate 's name has been bandied about as the next head of Commerce . Obama spoke with Richardson about the position November 14 , a senior Democratic source said . The source said Richardson has always been on Obama 's list of possibilities for the key Cabinet position . Richardson , 61 , also traveled to Chicago , Illinois , in November to meet with Obama , according to a source . `` He brings to this plate , in particular in an era where the economy is the focus of attention , a lot of skills that could be put to use -- perhaps opening up marketplaces for U.S. products abroad , '' CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said . `` In New Mexico , he sought to bring in new businesses and to create jobs ... so the Obama team considers this part of the economic team . '' One of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in the nation , Richardson withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination January 10 and later endorsed Obama . He has served as a U.N. ambassador and as energy secretary in the Clinton administration . If Richardson steps down as chief executive of New Mexico , Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish takes over . She was Richardson 's running mate in the 2002 and 2006 gubernatorial elections . It 's a very different situation in neighboring Arizona , where another Democratic governor , Janet Napolitano , is also stepping down to join the Cabinet . Arizona does n't have a lieutenant governor . Under state law , Secretary of State Jan Brewer -- a Republican -- takes over . Richardson sought the Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out of the race after a poor showing in the January 8 New Hampshire primary . Declaring that Obama is an `` extraordinary American , '' Richardson endorsed Obama to be the Democratic nominee for president March 21 . `` Barack Obama will make a great and historic president , '' Richardson said at a rally in Portland , Oregon , with Obama at his side . '' -LSB- It -RSB- is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our nation , and you are a once-in-a-lifetime leader . '' Obama said , `` I am extraordinarily grateful to have the support of one of the great public servants of these United States . '' `` He 's done the kind of work that you want from your public servants , somebody who 's driven not just by raw ambition , not just by an interest in personal aggrandizement , '' Obama added . `` He 's been somebody who 's been motivated by the desire to make the lives of his constituents and working people a little bit better . '' Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton both lobbied Richardson for his endorsement . Richardson said that his `` affection for Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton will never waver '' but that `` it is now time for a new generation of leadership . '' Obama `` can bring us the change we so desperately need by bringing us together as a nation here at home and with our allies abroad , '' he said . Hillary Clinton was named this week as Obama 's pick for another Cabinet post : secretary of state . Richardson caused controversy in Democratic circles with his endorsement of Obama this year . In April , Richardson said he was `` very close to endorsing '' Clinton but decided not to after the campaign became negative . His endorsement was viewed as an act of betrayal by some longtime Clinton supporters . CNN political analyst James Carville , who has close ties to both Clintons , likened Richardson 's endorsement to Judas ' betrayal of Christ . Richardson responded to Carville 's criticisms by saying that Carville and other Clinton supporters believe they are a `` dynasty '' and that they were `` clinging to the throne .

{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cheryl Reed 's morning routine starts like that of millions of other mothers around the country . She makes breakfast for her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter , piles them into a minivan and drops them off at school . Cheryl Reed has a rare form of breast cancer that mostly affects young African-American women . It 's the next stop that sets Reed apart from other women . Three weeks a month , she heads to the infusion center at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , for chemotherapy treatments . Reed , 40 , has breast cancer ; not just any form of the disease , but a rare , aggressive and difficult to treat version called triple negative . Of the estimated 180,000 women who learn they have invasive breast cancer this year in the United States , about 15 percent will have triple negative . Like Reed , the majority of triple negative patients will be young African-American women . `` It never occurred to me that I 'm going to die from this , '' Reed said . `` I was like , ` I 've got breast cancer , let 's take care of it . ' '' Reed did take care of it . For eight months during 2006 , she endured chemotherapy and radiation treatments . She thought the cancer was in remission , but it returned last November . This time , it had spread to her liver , lungs and chest wall . `` Triple negative cancers do tend to be aggressive in their natural histories , so they have a very high rate of recurrence or relapsing , '' explained Dr. Ruth O'Regan , Reed 's oncologist at the Winship Institute . She 's one of several breast cancer experts around the country who are trying to learn more about what causes triple negative and how to treat it more effectively . Dr. Funmi Olopade , a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago , was at the forefront of identifying triple negative and the trend among African-American women . She said what makes it different from other types of breast cancer is that women with the disease lack three hormone receptors known to fuel most breast cancer tumors : estrogen , progesterone and HER2 . Health Minute : More on triple negative breast cancer '' `` When you have triple negative , it means that we can not use hormone therapy . ... The only way we can treat that type of breast cancer is to use chemotherapy , '' Olopade said . Tamoxifen and Herceptin , two of the most effective medications for treating breast cancer , do n't work for triple negative breast cancer patients . But if a patient responds well to chemotherapy , Olopade said , there 's a very good chance of curing the disease . `` The challenge we have is when the cancer comes back , '' she added . `` Right now , we do n't have any effective way to treat it , and that 's why when it comes back , it tends to be deadly . '' Reed is enrolled in a clinical trial at the Winship center where she 's receiving chemotherapy along with a drug called Avastin , which cuts the blood supply to cancer cells . Olopade is hoping better drugs will be available in the next two to five years that will help eradicate triple negative cancer cells . In the meantime , she stressed , early detection is the key to recovery , especially for women at highest risk . `` In this country , what we have found was young African-American women have a rate that is higher than young white women , and we do n't know if that is because of a gene or other risk factors , '' Olopade said . `` We know that women with a family history of breast cancer who have a BRCA1 mutation are most at risk , '' she said . BRCA1 is a major breast cancer-causing gene that was identified 14 years ago . Olopade said women born with the defective gene have a higher chance of getting breast cancer and at a younger age . Olopade also wants to explore further whether triple negative rates are higher among women who do not breastfeed their children . `` It 's that first pregnancy and first breastfeeding that really allows the breast to become fully mature , '' she said . She worried that in general , `` African-Americans are not likely to breastfeed , as they are getting in the work force and returning to work soon after childbirth . '' Even with several clues , Olopade acknowledged that researchers still do n't know a lot about triple negative breast cancer and more study is needed . She encouraged all young women , no matter what their race , to talk to their doctor about doing a risk assessment for the BRCA1 gene . If there is a family history of the gene mutation , some physicians may tell a woman not wait until she turns 40 to get her first mammogram . `` We begin screening as early at 25 , '' Olopade said . `` Many of the women are surviving . They are beating the odds of dying because they know they can do preventive approaches to reduce their risk of dying . '' Reed is trying to increase her chances of survival by getting experimental treatment in the clinical trial . She seems to be responding well , but she 's realistic . `` There 's always the possibility that once this is done , it could be two years and I 'm back in treatment again , '' she said . `` It really is a part of my life now . ... I 'm a survivor . '' CNN 's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of a highly publicized chimpanzee attack , the U.S. House made its first official move to ban humans from owning primates as pets . Travis , seen here as a younger chimp , was fatally shot by police after attacking a woman , authorities say . The House overwhelmingly voted in favor of passing the Captive Primate Safety Act on Tuesday , which prohibits people from buying or transporting primates across state lines to keep as pets . This legislation amended the Lacey Act , which had only applied to wildlife and fish . The Humane Society of the United States applauded the bill , which passed by a vote of 323 to 95 . `` There is no reason for any private citizen to keep a primate as a pet , and this trade is driven by unscrupulous dealers who sell primates across state lines for thousands of dollars , '' said Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of the HSUS . Last week , Charla Nash , 55 , was left with severe trauma to her face , scalp and hands after her neighbor 's pet chimpanzee , Travis , mauled her in Stamford , Connecticut . Police shot Travis to halt the attack , and he later died of gunshot wounds . Nash was brought to the famed Cleveland Clinic , where the nation 's first face transplant was performed . Doctors there are contemplating whether to offer her a similar procedure . The bill was introduced by U.S. Reps. Earl Blumenauer , D-Oregon , and Mark Kirk , R-Illinois , who said it would protect animals and humans from similar attacks . `` As the tragic attack in Connecticut shows us , The Captive Primate Safety Act is necessary , common-sense legislation for the welfare of humans and animals , '' Blumenauer said . `` Make no mistake , this bill will protect communities and ensure the humane treatment of these animals . '' `` It is inhumane to cage primates in private homes . Besides the animal cruelty concerns , the interstate movement of pet primates creates serious public health and safety risks . The Captive Primate Safety Act takes important steps to address these concerns , '' Kirk said . As cute as they can be , primates can inflict serious injuries and spread life-threatening disease , according to the Humane Society . The average pet owner can not provide for their basic social and physical needs in captivity , says the organization , which estimates 15,000 monkeys and other primates are living as either pets or in private zoos . `` As infants , they are fascinating , '' said Beth Preiss , who directs the organization 's Exotic Pet Campaign . `` But they grow up and become dangerous to manage . '' The bill moves now to the Senate , where Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana will lead the effort to pass the legislation .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED . CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : I 'm Carl Azuz , and you 're tuned in to CNN Student News . Let 's go ! First Up : State of the Union AZUZ : `` He shall from time to time give to Congress information on the state of the union . '' The words of the U.S. Constitution and the reason why President Obama delivered his State of the Union address to Congress last night . A little background for you here : This speech has n't always been called the `` State of the Union . '' It used to be called the `` annual message . '' But the purpose has always been the same : for the president to talk about some of the biggest issues facing the country . That is why President Obama spent a good part of last night 's speech talking about the economy and the challenges facing the country . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : One year ago , I took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a government deeply in debt . Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression . So we acted , immediately and aggressively . And one year later , the worst of the storm has passed . But the devastation remains . One in ten Americans still can not find work . Republican Response AZUZ : After the State of the Union , it 's traditional for the other party to offer its response to the president . Last night , the Republican response was given by newly-elected Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell . He won that election last year . McDonnell made his speech from the Virginia state House . He talked about some of the political issues that both parties agree on . But he also focused on some of the areas , especially when it comes to the economy , where Republicans and Democrats do n't see eye to eye . GOV. BOB MCDONNELL , -LRB- R -RRB- VIRGINIA : In the past year , more three million people have lost their jobs , yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt on our children and grandchildren . The amount of this debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in ten . The federal debt is already over $ 100,000 per household . This is simply unsustainable . The President 's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one .

Denise Stryker-Grant is getting stimulus money through a grant , but it 's not much ; $ 200,000 spread out over 3 years that will help keep people in their homes . But she says jobs , the only thing that would really help , remain elusive . DENISE STRYKER-GRANT , CLINTON COUNTY HOMELESS SHELTER : The frustration of continuing to refer them to places only to be told , you know , `` We 've got 500 resumes before you 've even walked in the door , '' and the frustration of them not having any opportunities . SNOW : To create opportunities , Wilmington 's mayor David Raizk applied for more than $ 61 million worth of stimulus projects . Of that , roughly $ 5 million has been awarded so far to a project to create jobs . It 's focused on Wilmington 's downtown and is set to start this spring . So , how do you see this benefiting from stimulus money ? DAVID RAIZK , WILMINGTON MAYOR : With the stimulus project , we 'll be able to improve our curbs and gutters and sidewalks SNOW : The hope , he says , is that improvements will attract businesses . In the immediate future , the project is estimated to create about 100 jobs . RAIZK : They 're going to be construction jobs , but it 's something , it 's something . We want jobs here of any type right now . SNOW : To get thousands of others back to work , the mayor has set his sights on Wilmington 's airpark and is hoping to redevelop it . Eight million dollars in stimulus money , he says , is being used to retrain workers , and he 's optimistic Washington will come through with more aid if the airpark comes back to life . RAIZK : I have tried to maintain a close relationship with our state partners and with our federal partners to say , `` Look , we need help and what can you do ?

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It says something about the popularity of `` Dancing With the Stars '' that the show 's professional dancers have become almost as famous as the celebrities they 're paired with . Mark Ballas and Shawn Johnson celebrate after winning last season 's `` Dancing With the Stars . '' Take Mark Ballas , who last season waltzed and tangoed his way to a first-place finish with Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson -- his second mirror ball trophy since he joined the hit series in 2007 . At just 23 , Ballas is already recognized on the street , he 's in a band with fellow `` Dancing '' pro Derek Hough , and he 's thinking about branching out into acting . For the new season of `` Dancing With the Stars , '' which begins Monday , Ballas is paired with Melissa Joan Hart , best known for her roles in the television series `` Sabrina , the Teenage Witch '' and `` Clarissa Explains It All . '' Ballas spoke to CNN about his new celebrity partner , his training routine and whether former `` American Idol '' judge Paula Abdul could find a new home on the show . The following is an edited version of that interview . CNN : What is Melissa Joan Hart like as a dancer ? Mark Ballas : She 's doing really well so far . I think she 's going to shock a lot of people , and I think they will love her personality . She 's really bright and bubbly . CNN : Does she have any dancing experience ? Ballas : No , she 's never danced before . I mean , she took a couple of ballet classes when she was a child , but everyone 's done that . She 's never danced like this before , so it 's been a bit of a learning curve for her , but hopefully she 'll smooth it out . CNN : Did you know who she was before you were matched ? Ballas : Oh , yeah . I used to watch her shows all the time when I was younger . I would watch `` Clarissa Explains It All '' and `` Sabrina , the Teenage Witch '' after school . CNN : Do you get any input in what celebrity you are paired with ? Ballas : No , we get no choice whatsoever . It 's basically -LSB- dependent on -RSB- whether they think our personalities will be compatible and also on height . You have to be the right height , because if someone is 6 feet and your partner is 5 feet , it wo n't work out . CNN : How do you choreograph dances ? Do you like to use certain routines over again ? Ballas : I start fresh every time . Having a good song is definitely helpful , and when you get a new song , it 's really inspiring and makes you want to move , and that 's the fun of it . You always want to keep things fresh , and I always keep challenging myself , like how can I outdo what I did last time ? CNN : The facial expressions seem so important in ballroom dancing . How do you teach that to your celebrity partners ? Ballas : That 's something you ca n't teach . Obviously , you explain what the dance is and how you have to act and what you should be thinking , but you do n't choreograph facial expressions . That 's got to come from the heart and the soul , and you just have to feel it . CNN : If you have a celebrity partner like Kim Kardashian , who was criticized for being wooden on the dance floor , is there anything you can do ? Ballas : The best thing to do is to make them feel comfortable . Kim got very shy when the cameras were on , and she would always dance a lot better off camera . But sometimes , dancing just is n't for certain people . Kim and I had a great time together and still are good friends to this day . But dancing was n't her thing , she just did n't take to it . CNN : Do you keep in touch with your former partners ? Ballas : Yes , I talk to Shawn -LSB- Johnson -RSB- and Kristi Yamaguchi all the time ; I talked to Kim Kardashian about an hour ago . We stay good friends . Kristi Yamaguchi was amazing to work with -- great temperament , really eager to learn , she was like a machine . Kim Kardashian was a doll . We talk all the time , we hang out when we can , she 's a lot of fun . Shawn Johnson was just a joy to work with , from start to finish . Just an absolute sweetheart . We had a lot of fun , we laughed a lot . CNN : A lot of people were surprised that actor Gilles Marini did n't win last season . What 's your take on that ? Ballas : I definitely feel that Shawn was the better dancer . Gilles was a great performer , but technically -- if you were looking at technique and you 're looking at dancing -- Shawn was the stronger dancer . Her routines were a lot harder , her technique was a lot stronger ... especially in the last four weeks . I definitely feel like it was a fair result . CNN : Your father , Corky Ballas , who is also a professional dancer , made quite a splash when he was paired with 80-something Cloris Leachman on `` Dancing '' last year . Is he coming back to the show anytime soon ? Ballas : I hope so . It was a lot of fun having him around , and I thought he was amazing , of course . They were a great team , absolutely hilarious . I 'm sure if they ask him back , which I 'm hoping they do , that he would definitely come back . CNN : There were some suggestions that Paula Abdul might join the show as a judge . What do you think about that ? Ballas : I think that Paula would be great as a contestant . If she wanted to be on our show , she should come on to compete and be partnered with one of us . As far as the judges , I love our judges . I think our judges are great , and I think we 've got a great system , and I do n't think there would be any need for an extra judge . I love Paula -- I 've met her several times because `` American Idol '' is right next door to us . I would love for her to come on the show and be my partner . CNN : Are you recognized on the street ? Ballas : I have loads of people come up to me . They ask questions about the season . It 's really nice , and I really appreciate it . CNN : Your fellow pros on `` Dancing , '' Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff , broke off their engagement recently . Is that going to affect the show in any way ? Ballas : We 're all very professional . These things happen . It will definitely not affect the show , we 'll keep on dancing . You wo n't even be able to tell . I 've talked to Max several times . He 's doing OK . These things are never easy , and Max is a dear , dear friend of mine . I 've known him for 13 years . CNN : What are your career goals beyond dancing ? Ballas : I 'm actually a guitar player and a singer\/songwriter . I studied musical theater and music and vocals . Anything to do with music is definitely a big goal of mine . I 've studied acting for 10 years , so I 'd love to do film at some point as well .","question":""}
{"answer":"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistan 's foreign ministry said Wednesday that it has lodged a `` strong '' protest with the U.S. ambassador over missile attacks conducted on Pakistani soil by unmanned drones . The aftermath of a suspected U.S. drone attack on a building in North Waziristan . The ministry said it summoned Ambassador Anne Patterson to underscore that such attacks violate Pakistan 's sovereignty and should be stopped immediately . A statement from the ministry said Patterson was also told that the attacks have cost lives and undermined public support for Pakistan 's counter terrorism efforts . The ministry lodged its protests three days after a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people . Pakistan has repeatedly raised objections to foreign nations violating its sovereignty to pursue terrorists . A U.S. ground operation in September that left several civilians dead rankled relations between the two countries . Last week , Pakistan 's parliament passed a resolution that condemned any incursion on Pakistani soil by foreign forces . The resolution called for a review of the country 's national security strategy and said the government needs to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity . The ministry said it handed Patterson a copy of the resolution . The U.S. and NATO , which have troops in Afghanistan , have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants who launch attacks from Pakistan 's swath of tribal areas along the border . They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years , saying it is not being proactive enough against militants -- a claim Pakistan denies . The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely . In another development , suspected Taliban militants kidnapped three government officials from an administrative office in Pakistan 's tribal region Wednesday , officials said . The militants abducted two employees and a security guard from the Ambar district in Mohmand Agency . Mohmand is in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where U.S. and Pakistani officials have reported a presence of militants . Earlier in the day , militants tried unsuccessfully to take control of a school in Mohmand and abduct about 100 students , authorities said . A shootout with Frontier Corps followed , in which one militant was killed and another arrested . The Frontier Corps is a paramilitary force which uses recruits from Pakistan 's tribal areas and is overseen by Pakistani army officers . Also Wednesday , a suicide car bomber detonated explosives outside a police checkpoint in northwest Pakistan , killing two security personnel , officials said . The Wednesday afternoon attack in the Bannu district of the North West Frontier Province also wounded a dozen people , military sources said . The bomber targeted a check point near a military hospital , said the sources who did not want their names revealed because they are not authorized to speak to the media .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Texas man convicted of murdering a San Antonio police officer before turning his gun on his wife was put to death Thursday evening , soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his last-minute appeal . The time of death for Frank Martinez Garcia was 7:02 p.m. CT -LRB- 8:02 p.m. ET -RRB- , said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Becky Blanton . Garcia was 28 on March 29 , 2001 , when San Antonio police officer Hector Garza responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the home Garcia shared with his parents , his wife , Jessica , and their children . Garza , 49 , died first after being shot three times by Garcia , the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said on its website . Garcia 's wife died after he shot her six times . He also fired several shots at others outside the home , wounding his wife 's uncle , according to authorities . The couple 's 5-year-old daughter witnessed the murders , according to the Department of Criminal Justice . The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott stated , on its website , that Garcia -- who had been arrested with gang members in 1992 -- also fired his weapon at the vice principal of a nearby elementary school , hitting the front door of the school . Garcia eventually surrendered to police , later admitting in a formal written statement that he had intentionally killed both the police officer and his wife , according to the attorney general . A Bexar County grand jury indicted him in September 2001 for capital murder . During his trial , jurors saw photos from inside Garcia 's home showing him and his wife brandishing weapons . Prosecutors also noted that his wife Jessica sought help from a battered women 's shelter in 1994 , after alleging physical and emotional abuse , while her co-workers had seen marks and bruises on her . In February 2002 , Garcia was convicted and sentenced to death . The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction two years later . And in 2007 , the same court denied his application for habeas corpus relief -- in other words , claiming the state did n't have a right to hold him -- according to the attorney general . A U.S. district court turned down a similar petition in 2009 , and a U.S. Circuit of Appeals court rejected his appeal the following year . In March 2011 , the U.S. Supreme Court denied his writ of certiorari review , a legal term related to a higher court reviewing a lower court 's decision .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A diabetes test that measures a person 's average blood glucose control over the preceding two to three months is being recommended as the new diagnostic tool for the condition . Diabetics have too much glucose in their blood when the condition is uncontrolled , and must monitor it . A committee of international experts recommended the test , called the the A1C assay , at the American Diabetes Association 's 69th Scientific Sessions over the weekend . The report could instigate a change in the way diabetes is diagnosed , the American Diabetes Association said . The A1C assay , which has been used for nearly 30 years to determine how well a patient controls diabetes , is a more stable , reliable diagnostic tool than the techniques currently in use , the authors of the report said . `` This committee that I chaired is recommending that this be used as widely as possible to diagnose diabetes instead of the blood sugar test , '' said Dr. David Nathan , director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and chairman of the committee . The A1C test , which consists of a simple blood test , is also more convenient than the two tests commonly used for diabetes -- the fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test -- the authors said . In the fasting test , the patient does not eat for about 12 to 14 hours before a blood test . In the tolerance test , the patient drinks a sweet solution and has blood drawn two hours later . In addition , Nathan said , `` It probably is better related to the development of eye disease with diabetes , and therefore probably serves as a better diagnostic tool . '' The international committee was assembled by the American Diabetes Association , International Diabetes Federation and European Association for the Study of Diabetes , but those organizations have not officially endorsed the report . `` Basically , the American Diabetes Association supports the concept , supports the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes , and just has to look at the implications of it , and the implementation of it , '' said Richard Kahn , Chief Scientific and Medical Officer for the American Diabetes Association , who was part of the committee . Using A1C in diagnosis would be particularly useful for determining whether patients have type 2 diabetes , which is more difficult to diagnose than type 1 , said Dr. William Bornstein , assistant professor of endocrinology at Emory University , who was not part of the committee . `` This will be beneficial to the population in terms of helping us more clearly diagnose folks who are at risks for complications and help them manage that earlier , '' Bornstein said . Still , controversy likely will arise over the use of the A1C in diagnostics because of the long , established track record of using the other two methods , Bornstein said . iReport.com : Boxing champ talks about diabetes struggle How it works Humans can not live without having sugar called glucose in their blood . Too much glucose , however , attaches to a variety of proteins in the body and harms them . Uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by too much glucose in the bloodstream . This excess glucose then glycates with -- or sticks to -- a protein called hemoglobin , which carries oxygen from the lungs to the body 's cells . The A1C test measures the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood , which is a reflection of average blood glucose control , according to the American Diabetes Association . A1C is a better measure of the problem that diabetes causes than glucose-based tests , at least for monitoring , said David Schoenfeld , professor of biostatistics at Harvard University . He and colleagues , including Nathan and a large group of international researchers , studied the relationship between A1C and average blood glucose . While many diabetics monitor their average blood glucose levels daily , at the doctor 's office the patient receives a measurement in terms of hemoglobin A1C , Schoenfeld said . He and researchers created a chart to convert these two measurements , so that patients would not have to interpret two different numbers and feel confused . They concluded in a 2008 paper that , for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes , A1C levels can be expressed as average glucose . The international committee concluded that an A1C level of 6.5 percent indicates that a person has diabetes , while values between 6 percent and 6.5 percent are likely to be at highest risk for developing diabetes . Experts note , however , that there is a continuum of risk for complications , and the `` cut-point '' of 6.5 percent should not be considered an absolute dividing line . All adults who are overweight and have additional risk factors , such as family history of diabetes , high blood pressure or abnormal lipid levels , should be screened for diabetes , according to the American Diabetes Association . Adults aged 45 or older should be tested even if they do not have these risk factors , the association said .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution Friday that says it supports `` all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law . '' Throngs in Tehran cheer Thursday for defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi , center . The resolution was approved by 405 lawmakers , while one -- Rep. Ron Paul , R-Texas -- voted against it . Two others , Reps. Brad Ellsworth , D-Indiana , and Dave Loebsack , D-Iowa , voted `` present . '' In a statement on his Web site , Paul said he voted against the measure because he is `` always very cautious about ` condemning ' the actions of governments overseas . '' `` I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little , '' said Paul , who attracted attention last year during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination . `` And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran . '' The resolution , which also `` condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators , '' was sponsored by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman , D-California , and two Republicans , Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia . Speaking shortly after the resolution passed , Pence called it a message from Americans to the Iranian people . `` As Americans have done throughout our history , this Congress today , on behalf of the American people , has spoken a word of heartfelt support to all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law , '' he said . He urged U.S. senators to support the identical resolution that Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , introduced Friday . Both Pence and McCain have been outspoken in their criticism of President Obama 's response to massive rallies in Iran against the results of last week 's presidential election . Watch as Obama walks a fine line '' Supporters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi have taken to the streets this week calling for a new election after the results of the June 12 vote showed an overwhelming victory for hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . The rallies also have denounced the Iranian government 's crackdown on the protests in which at least eight people have died . Obama has said he is `` deeply troubled '' by the violence , but he has avoided siding with Ahmadinejad 's opponents , telling reporters , `` It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be . '' `` It 's not productive , given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations , to be seen as meddling , the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections , '' Obama said this week . But several Republicans , particularly McCain -- Obama 's opponent in last year 's presidential race -- have criticized the administration 's position . McCain introduced a resolution on the Senate floor Friday morning that he said would be `` an expression of support by the government and the people of the United States of America '' for those protesting the election results . `` It is unfortunate in a way that this resolution is required since the administration does not want to ` meddle ' and has refused , the president has refused to speak out in support of these brave Iranian citizens , most of them young , who are risking their very lives to protest what was clearly an unfair and corrupt election , '' McCain told his fellow senators . Watch what else McCain said about Obama '' The resolution passed Friday states that the House : On Thursday , Cantor joined the critics of the White House , saying the United States has a `` moral responsibility '' to condemn attacks on protesters . `` The administration 's position that what 's going on in Iran is a ` vigorous debate ' is absurd , '' he said . `` People are being brutalized and murdered by the regime in Tehran . We have no idea exactly how many have died or have been seriously injured since the regime has restricted journalists . In no way do these actions constitute a ` vigorous debate . ' '' Cantor , the No. 2 Republican in the House , added , `` America has a moral responsibility to stand up for these brave people , to defend human rights and to condemn the violence and abuses by the regime in Tehran . '' Watch amateur video of protesters under attack '' Pence has called on the United States `` to take a half-step back from this administration 's olive branch and the apology approach to enemies and countries that have been hostile to the United States of America and our allies , particularly with the road to Iran . '' But Sen. John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Washington would be making an `` enormous mistake '' by taking sides in the Iranian protests . `` There is no need for the United States of America to step into the middle of it and make this about America , '' Kerry told CNN 's `` The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer . '' `` It is an Iranian moment , spurred on by Iranians , thoroughly supported by Iranians to the degree that the supreme ayatollah has now backed off his own support for the elections -LSB- and -RSB- called for an investigation , '' he said . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the administration 's approach this week , saying that Obama `` believes that he 's struck the right tone . '' `` I know some people agree with what Sen. McCain said . Some people agree with what other Republicans have said that 's very much like the president 's position , '' Gibbs said Thursday . `` The president strongly believes that we should -- and have -- spoken out to ensure the demonstrators have the universal right and principle to demonstrate without fear of harm . But at the same time , we have to respect their sovereignty . '' Moorhead Kennedy , a former diplomat who was among those taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 , said he supports the Obama administration 's position . `` I think if I had any conclusion to draw , we would have been much better off not interfering in Iran now , '' Kennedy told CNN 's `` American Morning . '' Because the United States backed a 1953 coup that put Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in charge , and supported him until the 1979 revolution that created today 's Islamic republic , Kennedy said , `` There are a great many resentments there .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Ohio inmate , convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991 , was executed Tuesday using a new , untested one-drug method of lethal injection , state officials said . Kenneth Biros , 51 , was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m. at a prison in Lucasville , Ohio , the state attorney general 's office said in a written statement . His last words , according to Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman Julie Walburn , were : `` Sorry from the bottom of my heart . I want to thank all of my family and friends for my prayers and who supported and believed in me . `` My father , now I 'm being paroled to heaven , '' Biros said , according to Walburn . `` I will now spend all of my holidays with my lord and savior , Jesus Christ . Peace be with you all . Amen . '' Biros ' execution is the first in Ohio since September , when the governor and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner , Romell Broom . The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for the injections . The one-drug method had never been tried on a U.S. death row inmate . It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein . A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup , officials said . The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals . The same drug , sodium thiopental , at a much lower dosage , is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio , as well as in all but one of the other 34 states that allow the death penalty . Some capital punishment opponents claim the sodium thiopental , which renders the prisoner unconscious , can wear off too quickly , and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues . Biros ' execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m. , but preparations were delayed as officials waited for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on Biros ' request for a stay , Walburn said . The high court without comment denied the request about 10 a.m. , and `` we were about an hour behind '' in preparations , she said . The execution began around 11 a.m. Biros died about 10 minutes after the drugs began to flow , she said , but he was not officially pronounced dead until later . Biros , 51 , was convicted of killing Tami Engstrom near the town of Warren . He met the woman at a bar and offered to drive her home , and later admitted robbing and attempting to rape her . Prosecutors said Biros dismembered Engstrom and spread her body parts around northeast Ohio and neighboring Pennsylvania . The crime was `` particularly heinous , with 91 pre-mortem wounds , '' according to the clemency report . Biros claimed he acted in a fit of drunken rage . He was involved in litigation challenging the three-drug method and received a stay of execution in 2007 because of his involvement in the suit , according to minutes of a November parole board meeting posted on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections ' Web site . His attorney , Timothy Sweeney , had also objected to the one-drug method , saying it was unconstitutional . Sweeney wrote in an appeal that use of the one-drug method would amount to `` human experimentation , pure and simple . '' But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month denied Biros ' request for a stay , concluding that since Ohio had announced it would change its protocol and rely on the one-drug method , Biros ' argument regarding the three-drug method was moot . Biros ' last meal was served about 7:45 p.m. Monday -- pizza with extra cheese , mushrooms , onions and green peppers , along with onion rings , deep-fried mushrooms , Doritos , french onion dip , blueberry ice cream , Dr Pepper and cherry pie , Walburn said . During its meeting last month , members of the state parole board heard a prerecorded statement from Engstrom 's mother , Mary Jane Heiss , according to the meeting minutes . Heiss said her health was not good but she was saving her strength to attend Biros ' execution . `` Since her daughter 's death , she has endured nearly 20 years of constant pain and nightmares , '' the minutes said . `` She believes that the nightmares will end with the execution . It makes her sick that Biros tortured and brutally murdered her daughter . '' The board voted 7-0 to deny Biros clemency . In attempting to execute Broom in September , authorities tried unsuccessfully for hours to find a vein to administer his lethal injection . Afterward , Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay the executions of two other men until March at the earliest . Broom 's execution has not been rescheduled . Ohio has put 32 people to death in the past decade . CNN 's Bill Mears and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003 , the prosecutor in the case told CNN . The Americans did not appear for trial and are not in custody , but the ruling could effectively make them international fugitives . The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call `` extraordinary rendition . '' They say the United States has often sent suspects to countries that practice torture . Washington acknowledges making secret `` rendition '' transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do . The case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric , Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr , or Abu Omar . He was seized on the streets of Milan , Italy , in 2003 , transferred to Egypt and tortured , he said . He was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy 's intelligence agency . Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials . The verdict `` shows governments and institutions that the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with the law . There are no shortcuts , '' Spataro told CNN . Those who were found guilty were ordered to pay Abu Omar 1 million euros -LRB- $ 1.48 million -RRB- and his wife 500,000 euros . A total of 22 Americans were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction . Another -- Robert Seldon Lady , whom prosecutors said was the CIA station chief in Milan -- was sentenced to eight years in jail , prosecutor Armando Spataro told CNN . Cases were dismissed against three other Americans , including Jeff Castelli , the man assumed to be the CIA station chief in Rome at the time , because they had diplomatic immunity from prosecution . Spataro said he may appeal that ruling . Cases were also dismissed against the former head of Italy 's intelligence service and his deputy because of state secrecy provisions . Two other Italians were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot . Sabrina De Sousa , one of the American defendants , was `` saddened , angered and dismayed '' by the ruling , her lawyer told CNN . She felt the U.S. government had `` stabbed her in the back , '' Mark Zaid said . `` We understand why the Italians did what they did . They were following their laws . But at the end of the day , representatives of our United States government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government . '' De Sousa , a career diplomat , is suing the State Department over the case , Zaid confirmed . She has never said she worked for the CIA . CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday : `` The CIA has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding Abu Omar . '' But U.S. officials confirmed to CNN when the case first broke that the CIA was involved in the rendition of Abu Omar from Italy to Egypt . The officials never disclosed the number of Americans involved or their names . Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded to the verdict as it applied to an Air Force officer , Lt. Col. Joseph Romano III , who was among the Americans sentenced . The Pentagon had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement , a position that the Italian minister of justice supported , Morrell said . `` We are clearly disappointed by the court 's ruling , '' Morrell said . `` Our view is that the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lt. Col. Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges . '' The American Civil Liberties Union , a persistent critic of Washington 's extraordinary rendition program , demanded the United States match Italy 's actions . `` The decision in Italy underscores the need for the United States to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the ` extraordinary rendition ' program . It is shameful that the first convictions of this kind came from a foreign justice system , where those convicted are not likely to serve their time , '' said Steven Watt , staff attorney for the ACLU Human Rights Program . Italian authorities originally indicted 26 Americans and five Italians in 2007 for kidnapping in the matter . The Italians included the former head of Italian intelligence , Nicolo Pollari , and one of his deputies . They testified in preliminary hearings that Italian intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction . None of the Americans is in custody in Italy and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition ; they were tried in absentia . Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer told CNN in the past that the Italian military secret service had approved the operation involving Hassan , and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction . The Italian government of the day -- which was led by Silvio Berlusconi -- vigorously denied having authorized Hassan 's kidnapping , which it called illegal . Berlusconi has since returned to power . CNN 's Hada Messia in Rome ; Paula Newton in London , England ; and Pam Benson and Jim Barnett in Washington contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four men were indicted Tuesday in what prosecutors said was a plot to bomb two New York City synagogues and fire surface-to-air missiles at U.S. military planes . Three of the four suspects in the alleged synagogue bombing plot are shown after their arrests . The defendants -- James Cromitie , 44 ; David Williams , 28 ; Onta Williams , 32 ; and Laguerre Payen , 27 -- were charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction within the United States , conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles and six other counts . They face a maximum penalty of life in prison . Arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday . The plot was uncovered in a yearlong investigation involving an FBI informant . It ended with federal agents and New York police used an 18-wheel truck to block a vehicle carrying the suspects after they planted what they believed were explosive devices in cars near the synagogues , said New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly . The planted devices were actually duds . The four are accused of plotting to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and seeking to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base . Kelly described the plot as homegrown , with no known links to any foreign or domestic groups . At a court hearing on May 21 , U.S. Magistrate Lisa Smith ordered three of the suspects -- Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams -- to remain in custody without bail . Prosecutor Eric Snyder described the suspects as violent men `` eager to bring death to Jews . '' At a later hearing , the fourth suspect -- Laguerre Payen -- also was remanded without bail . Payen received medical treatment for injuries during the arrest and had a bandage over one eye at his hearing . Payen 's lawyer told the hearing that her client had a history of mental instability , but Snyder , the prosecutor , said videotapes of the plotters showed Payen to be a coherent and willing participant . Payen told the judge he has prescriptions for drugs used to treat depression and conditions including bipolar disorder . Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams are U.S. citizens , while Payen is Haitian , according to the New York governor 's office . Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the work of his city 's Police Department and federal authorities in uncovering the alleged plot . `` The good news here is that the New York Police Department and FBI did exactly what they 're trained to do and prevented what could have been a terrible event , '' Bloomberg said . `` We have to constantly be vigilant . '' `` Unfortunately , this is the world we live in , '' said Nurit Bacharach of the Gan Miriam Early Childhood Center at the Hebrew Institute in Riverdale . `` We just have to forge ahead and keep a positive mind and live life and just be cautious and aware . '' According to state and federal authorities , an FBI informant met with Cromitie in June 2008 in Newburgh , New York . During that meeting Cromitie said his parents live in Afghanistan , he was angry about the U.S. war there and that he had an interest in `` doing something to America . '' The four suspects began meeting with the informant at a home equipped with concealed video and audio equipment , plotting to bomb the synagogues , authorities said . The suspects also conducted surveillance , including photographs , of an Air National Guard base where they wanted to blow up planes , authorities said . The informant provided the men with a surface-to-air guided missile and C-4 plastic explosives , none of which could actually be used . `` No one was at risk , '' said Kelly , the police commissioner , describing the explosive devices as duds created to dupe the suspects .

{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Kingdom votes on a new government May 6 through a political system that dates back centuries . When does an election happen ? The UK has no written constitution . Instead the country 's electoral system is based on a series of parliamentary acts dating back to the 17th century , when men wore the sort of tights and wigs still donned on ceremonial occasions by some officials of the Houses of Parliament . A general election is when voters nationwide choose lawmakers who will sit in the House of Commons , the lower chamber which initiates and approves legislation . An election must take place , by law , at least every five years . That said , governments can call an election at any time during their term . They could also be forced into an election if they lose a majority of lawmakers in the Commons . Who calls an election ? The starting gun in a general election is traditionally fired when the prime minister travels to Buckingham Palace to ask the queen , the UK 's head of state , to dissolve parliament by royal proclamation . An election must then take place within weeks . Since 1979 , elections have been held between April and June . It is customary for an election to be held on a Thursday . The vote is conducted through the `` first past the post '' system whereby the candidate in each constituency with the most votes wins the seat . If the queen is the head of state , then how come the UK a democracy ? Although the UK is a monarchy , the powers of the reigning head of state have gradually dwindled since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians . Today , the monarch 's role is largely ceremonial and mostly restricted to state functions and appearing on stamps and banknotes . But the monarch still retains formal powers and opens parliament each year . How does parliament function ? The job of parliament is to make laws , scrutinize the actions of the government and debate issues of the day . The Commons -- which has green benches -- currently consists of 650 directly elected lawmakers known as Members of Parliament or MPs who each represent a geographical constituency . The upper house , the Lords -- which has red benches -- is mostly appointed by the government with members serving for life . Its main duty is to vote on legislation passed by the Commons and , when necessary , to send it back for further debate . In certain circumstances the government can force through legislation passed by the Commons but rejected by the Lords . How is an election decided ? Voters do not elect the prime minister , or head of government , directly . Rather , they vote to elect a candidate representing a particular party to serve as their local MP . The leader of the party which wins the most seats is then asked by the Queen to form a government . The leader of the second largest party in the Commons becomes the `` Leader of Her Majesty 's Opposition . '' MPs are elected by a plurality , rather than a majority , of votes . This means that a party can win a majority of seats in the Commons without achieving an overall majority in the overall popular vote . In fact , because there are three main parties in the UK it is extremely rare for a party to win an outright majority . The last prime minister elected by an outright majority was Stanley Baldwin , the Conservative Party leader , in 1931 . In 2005 , Tony Blair 's Labour Party won just 35 percent of the vote but still controlled a 66-seat majority in the House of Commons . So who can I vote for ? For most of the past century , British politics has been dominated by two parties , the left-wing Labour Party and the right-wing Conservative Party . That said , the boundaries between left and right have been blurred as each has strived to occupy the strategically important center ground . A third party , the centrist Liberal Democrats , usually picks up around 20 percent of votes but wins far fewer seats because it is squeezed between the two main parties . Parties from Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland also send small numbers of lawmakers to Westminster . Full guide to UK political parties What happens if a party does n't win a majority of seats ? If no party wins an overall majority -- a `` hung parliament '' -- then the leader of the party which takes the most seats will usually be invited by the monarch to form a government . But its powers will be limited because it can not control a majority of votes in the Commons . The party will usually call another election within months in a fresh attempt to secure a majority . What would a hung parliament mean in 2010 ? The last time this happened was in 1974 , when an election in February resulted in a hung parliament . A second election followed in October of the same year . Many opinion pollsters and observers believe that the 2010 general election will result in a hung parliament .","question":""}

The Gunners trail United by nine points with four matches left to play . Emmanuel Adebayor gave Arsenal a 48th minute lead but Cristiano Ronaldo equalized from the penalty spot minutes later with his 38th goal of the season . The loss dooms Arsene Wenger 's side to their third season without a trophy and ends a black week which also included a Champions League quarterfinal defeat to English rivals Liverpool . England midfielder Hargreaves , best known for his determined defending , Scored United 's 100th goal in 50 games this campaign when his curled free-kick from the edge of the box over the wall left goalkeeper Jens Lehmann standing . Adebayor headed Arsenal in front three minutes into the second period when he met Robin van Persie 's cross and profited from confusion between United keeper Edwin van der Sar and center-back Rio Ferdinand . There were no complaints from United about the goal but tv replays suggested Adebayor may have handled the ball rather than knocked it in with his head , even though he was just a few yards away from goal . Six minutes later Arsenal defender William Gallas clearly handled inside his own area and referee Howard Webb pointed to the spot . Ronaldo netted but Webb ordered the penalty to be re-taken because of encroachment by other players . Lehmann , only playing because of a wrist injury to first-choice keeper Manuel Almunia , was then booked for delaying the second kick .

{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In an unprecedented move in Iranian politics , a reformist presidential candidate accused President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of tainting the country 's image by questioning the Holocaust and by wielding a reckless leadership style . Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who came to power in 2005 , is seeking a second term in office . The frontrunners in Iran 's presidential race clashed during a fiery debate broadcast to a national television audience on Wednesday evening . The verbal jousting between Ahmadinejad and opponent Mir Hossein Mousavi -- a former prime minister and reformist candidate who poses a threat to the firebrand Iranian president -- lasted an hour and half . Mousavi said Ahmadinejad 's dictatorial ways have hurt Iran 's image across the globe and could be a prelude to a dictatorship . `` There are two ways of confronting the country 's problems , '' Mousavi said . `` One is through a management style based on adventurism , instability , play-acting , exaggerations , wrongdoing , being secretive , self-importance , superficiality and ignoring the law . The second way is based on realism , respect , openness , collective wisdom and avoiding extremism . '' He said Ahmadinejad 's denials of the Holocaust had repulsed Iran 's allies . `` This has greatly damaged us , '' Mousavi said . The Iranian president called the Holocaust , in which six million Jews perished at the hands of the Nazis , `` a big deception . '' Ahmadinejad also has lashed out at the United States and Israel , calling at various times for the end of Israel 's existence as a Jewish state . In addition to Mousavi , two other challengers -- former parliament speaker Mahdi Karoudi , another reformist , and hard-liner Mohsen Rezaei , secretary of Iran 's Expediency Council -- hope to unseat Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election . Neither took part in Wednesday 's debate . The outcome of the election will set the tone for Iran 's policies on crucial issues , including its nuclear ambitions and the possibility of bilateral talks with Washington . Wednesday night 's event was the first of four debates that will pair two of the candidates against each other ahead of next week 's presidential elections . Ahmadinejad , known for his attacks against his foes , accused Mousavi of colluding with Iran 's former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani . Ahmadinejad , seeking a second term in office , accused the two Iranian figures of mismanagement , corruption and the masterminding of a plot to force him from power . `` I have tolerated all the personal insults and lies for four years and I forgive those responsible for them , '' Ahmadinejad said . `` But I do not have the authority to turn a blind eye when the people and the people 's choice and their interests are insulted . '' Ahmadinejad accused Mousavi and the two former leaders of standing against the Iranian nation and conspiring against him . Ahmadinejad said that , in the early days of his presidency , Rafsanjani sent a message to the king of a Persian Gulf state that said : `` Do not worry . This government will fall within six months . '' Hours after the debate , Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani met at a ceremony commemorating the death of Imam Ruhollah Khomeini , the leader of the revolution that overthew the ruling monarchy in 1979 and established Iran as an Islamic republic . The meeting was cordial , with Rafsanjani holding on to Ahmadinejad 's arm throughout their talk , the semi-official Fars news agency said . Rafsanjani , a powerful cleric who heads the Expediency Council and Assembly of Experts , remains an influential figure in Iran . He was president from 1989 to 1997 and then attempted to position himself in the political center in the 2005 elections , when he publicly favored a policy that would relax tensions with the United States . The two nations have had no diplomatic ties since the 1979 Islamic Revolution . Rafsanjani lost to the ultra-conservative Ahmadinejad , who was then Tehran 's mayor . Ahmadinejad 's accusations against the former Iranian presidents mark a change in traditional politics , in that he named them . Normally , charges are made via innuendo . Though the targets are clear , they go unnamed . The change could indicate that he has the backing of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Analysts say that , without at least a nod from Khamenei , Ahmadinejad would not dare implicate members of Iran 's powerful inner circle . Outside the TV station , supporters of both candidates stayed well after the debate had ended , chanting slogans and not fully dispersing until 4 a.m. , according to the semi-official Fars news agency . CNN 's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran contributed to this story .","question":""}

'' Boyd , 39 , who went by the name Saifullah , was charged along with two of his sons : Dylan Boyd , 22 , also known as Mohammed , and Zakariya Boyd , 20 .

The Boyd family and defendant Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan are identified as U.S.-born citizens . Defendant Hysen Sherifi is identified as a native of Kosovo who is a legal permanent resident of the United States , and Hiyad Yaghi and Anes Subasic are said to be naturalized U.S. citizens .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama released his long-awaited debt reduction plan Monday , outlining a roughly $ 3 trillion savings blueprint that was immediately criticized by top congressional and other Republicans . The president 's plan includes $ 1.5 trillion in new revenue generated largely by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans , a proposal strongly opposed by GOP leaders who insist that any tax increase will undermine an already shaky economy . The measure -- which would add to nearly $ 1 trillion in savings signed into law under the debt-ceiling deal enacted in August -- does not include changes to Social Security . It would increase Medicare premiums for individuals with higher incomes starting in 2017 -- the year Obama leaves office if he wins a second term . `` We are not going to have a one-sided deal that hurts the folks that are most vulnerable , '' Obama said at the White House , offering a defense of tax hikes on the highest earners . Spending cuts alone `` will not solve our fiscal problems . We ca n't just cut our way out of this hole , '' he added . `` It 's going to take a balanced approach . If we 're going to make spending cuts -- many of which we would n't make if we were n't facing such large budget deficits -- then it 's only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share . '' Obama explicitly promised to veto any debt-reduction legislation that cuts benefits while failing to include higher taxes on the wealthy . iReport : What do you think about Obama 's plan ? `` I will not support any plan that puts all the burden on ordinary Americans , '' he insisted . Republicans responded by dismissing the plan as little more than a cheap political gimmick . It 's `` a thinly veiled attempt to score political points , '' said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus . `` By raising taxes on job creators , Obama may win back some support from disgruntled liberal voters , but America will lose even more sorely needed jobs . '' `` Veto threats , a massive tax hike , phantom savings and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth \u00e2 $ '' or even meaningful deficit reduction , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky . `` Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership , '' added House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . Key congressional Democrats quickly rallied to Obama 's defense , calling the blueprint a serious attempt to take on one of the most contentious issues in Washington . The `` proposal is clearly moving in the right direction , '' said North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . `` It represents a significant and balanced plan for bringing our deficits and debt under control . '' On Monday night , Obama referred to the Republican response as predictable and said the issue shows the fundamental difference between the parties on how the nation should deal with mounting federal deficits and national debt . `` What has been clear over the last two and a half years is that we have not had a willing partner , '' Obama told a New York fundraising event . `` Now , we 've been able to get some stuff done despite that , and despite a filibuster in the Senate . But at least over the last nine months what we 've seen is some irreconcilable differences , let 's put it that way . '' The release of Obama 's blueprint is likely to set the stage for a fall dominated by harsh partisan debates over taxes and spending , as well as a 2012 presidential campaign focused on growing economic fears . Under Obama 's plan , $ 800 billion in revenue would be generated by allowing some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income households to expire , as the president has repeatedly called for . An additional $ 400 billion would result from capping the value of itemized deductions and other exemptions for high-income households . Read the White House plan -LRB- PDF -RRB- The remaining $ 300 billion would come from closing various tax loopholes , according to a senior administration official . A new tax surcharge could also be imposed on millionaires : the `` Buffett Rule , '' named after investor Warren Buffett , who argues that the richest Americans are not taxed enough . Wealthier Americans often derive much of their income from investments , which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income such as wages . As a result , they can end up owing a lower percentage of their income in federal taxes than someone who makes less money , especially once payroll taxes are factored in . The concept behind the Buffett Rule is that those earning more than $ 1 million should not be allowed to pay a lesser percentage of their income in federal taxes than Americans lower down the income scale .

Roughly 90 % of those savings will come from reducing overpayments in the system , according to a senior administration official . Any changes to Medicare benefits wo n't kick in before 2017 , the official said . An additional $ 72 billion will come from Medicaid and other health programs . The president 's plan does not include any Social Security reform proposals or changes to the Medicare eligibility age , reforms that have reportedly been put on the table by the administration in the past but are strongly opposed by a number of progressive Democrats . Another $ 1.1 trillion in savings would be generated by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . In addition , the administration is counting savings that would result from spending caps it has proposed on future overseas contingency operations . The administration also estimates interest savings of approximately $ 430 billion , a result of less borrowing and smaller annual budget shortfalls . Roughly $ 450 billion in the plan would be used to pay for the American Jobs Act , the economic stimulus measure proposed by Obama last week . Top Republicans call the president 's plan a form of class warfare . `` When you pick one area of the economy and you say , ` We 're going to tax those people because most people are not those people , ' that 's class warfare , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` We have a difference of opinion on how best to fix these problems , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin , told `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` But when the president does things like this , it leads you to believe that he 's not in bipartisan consensus-making mood . He 's in a political class-warfare mode and campaign mode . And that 's not good for our economy . '' Obama explicitly rejected the class warfare claim Monday . `` I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare , '' the president said . `` I think it 's just the right the thing to do . I believe the American middle class , who 've been pressured relentlessly for decades , believe it 's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations . '' Democrats have blamed Republicans for blocking the Obama administration 's initiatives purely for what Democrats insist are short-term political gain . `` I do n't think people like that style of politics , and that 's the reality ... we 'll be facing in November 2012 , '' Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , said Sunday . Congressional action on deficit reduction is moving on multiple tracks now . Durbin said the Democratic-controlled Senate would take up Obama 's jobs plan next month , while leaders in the Republican-controlled House have rejected some parts of it . Meanwhile , a special deficit reduction commission created under last month 's debt-ceiling agreement has started its work amid the longstanding political divisions on key issues . The 12-member committee , evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate , has until November 23 to draft a $ 1.5 trillion deficit-reduction plan that can win congressional approval by December 23 . Otherwise , more than $ 1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect , on top of $ 900 billion in cuts already mandated under the debt ceiling deal . The special committee `` is taking this issue far more seriously than the White House , '' McConnell said Monday . More than a year of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction has failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise tax revenue while cutting spending . The brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason that ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA-plus in August .

{"answer":"Caracas , Venezuela -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez pledged closer cooperation on Monday , vowing to fight poverty and imperialism . The two leaders signed a series of accords in the areas of industry , science , technology and politics , the state-run AVN news agency reported . Sitting side by side in front of a room full of reporters , they presented a united front in their opposition to the United States . `` It 's clear they are afraid of our development , '' said Ahmadinejad . Earlier , at a welcoming ceremony outside the Venezuelan presidential palace , the Iranian president called Chavez his `` dear brother , '' and said his nation has peaceful intentions . `` Our weapon is logic . Our weapon is culture . Our weapons are human values , '' he said . Chavez pledged to work with his Iranian counterpart to stop the `` imperial insanity '' of the United States , which he described as a `` threat for the world . '' The Venezuelan president mocked concerns from Washington about his country 's relationship with Iran , joking that U.S. media reports made it sound as though he and Ahmadinejad would be launching missiles and bombs at the U.S. capital . `` We are not warmongers , '' Chavez said , as the Iranian president nodded in agreement . `` Iran has not invaded anybody . '' It 's no coincidence that Venezuela is Ahmadinejad 's first stop on a four-nation Latin America tour this week . Despite their cultural differences , Venezuela and Iran have found significant common ground : Both are among the world 's top crude oil exporters , and their leaders are strong allies united by a fierce opposition to what they describe as U.S. imperialism . The Iranian leader arrived in Caracas on Sunday and is traveling with his ministers for foreign affairs , energy and economy , according to IRNA , Iran 's official news agency . Over the years , the two nations have signed more than 270 accords , including trade deals and agreements on construction projects , car and tractor factories , energy initiatives and banking programs . Chavez has also helped the Islamic republic forge relationships with other members of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas , an eight-nation regional bloc Chavez founded . Even before he arrived , Ahmadinejad 's plans for a Latin American tour grabbed global attention , as tensions grow between many Western powers and Iran over Tehran 's nuclear program . Officials in the United States and other Western nations have ratcheted up sanctions against Iran several times since a November report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said the Iranian government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon . Last month , U.S. President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Iran 's central bank . On Monday the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency confirmed that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran . Iran says there 's a medical purpose behind the nuclear program . But in Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said the confirmation that Iran was enriching uranium to `` a level that 's inappropriate '' is `` obviously a problem . '' Not everyone in Venezuela is happy with Ahmadinejad 's visit . Diego Arria , an opposition politician , described the trip as a `` provocation '' to the United States and an embarrassment for Venezuela . `` It comes at the worst moment -- at a time when Ahmadinejad is being looked at by the international community with great fear . ... It 's bringing the threat to the United States closer to home , '' he said . The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Nicaragua , Cuba and Ecuador later this week as part of his five-day tour .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The diabetes drug Avandia is linked with tens of thousands of heart attacks , and drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline knew of the risks for years but worked to keep them from the public , according to a Senate committee report released Saturday . The 334-page report by the Senate Finance Committee also criticized the Food and Drug Administration , saying that the federal agency that regulates food , tobacco and medications overlooked or overrode safety concerns found by its staff . `` Americans have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with Avandia and GlaxoSmithKline had a responsibility to tell them , '' said U.S. Senator Max Baucus , a Democrat and committee chairman . `` Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust . '' The bipartisan report also was signed by Sen. Chuck Grassley , the top-ranking Republican on the committee . GlaxoSmithKline rejected any assertions Saturday that the drug is not safe . `` We disagree with the conclusions in the report , '' company spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek told CNN . `` The FDA had reviewed the data and concluded that the drug should be on the market . '' Seven clinical trials on the drug prove that it is not linked to heart attacks , Pekarek said . `` None of that data shows a statistically significant correlation between Avandia and myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction -LSB- heart attack -RSB- , '' she said . Ischemia is a condition in which blood flow and oxygen are blocked from going to certain parts of the body . The Senate committee investigation stems from concerns that Avandia and other high-profile drugs put `` public safety at risk because the FDA has been too cozy with drug makers and has been regularly outmaneuvered by companies that have a financial interest in downplaying or under-exploring potential safety risks , '' the report states . FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said she is waiting for the recommendations of an advisory committee that will hear reports on the drug this summer . `` Meanwhile , '' Hamburg said in a statement , `` I am reviewing the inquiry made by Senators Baucus and Grassley and I am reaching out to ensure that I have a complete understanding and awareness of all of the data and issues involved . '' The Senate report was developed over the past two years by committee investigators who reviewed more than 250,000 pages of documents provided by GlaxoSmithKline , the FDA and several research institutes . Committee investigators also conducted numerous interviews and phone calls with GlaxoSmithKline , the FDA and anonymous whistleblowers . According to the Senate report : \u2022 FDA scientists estimated in July 2007 that Avandia was associated with approximately 83,000 heart attacks since the drug came to market . `` Had GSK considered Avandia 's potential increased cardiovascular risk more seriously when the issue was first raised in 1999 ... some of these heart attacks may have been avoided , '' the report states . \u2022 GlaxoSmithKline undertook attempts to undermine information critical of Avandia . `` GSK executives attempted to intimidate independent physicians , focused on strategies to minimize or misrepresent findings that Avandia may increase cardiovascular risk and sought ways to downplay findings that a competing drug might reduce cardiovascular risk , '' the report says . As an example , committee investigators say they found that GlaxoSmithKline experts verified an outside study showing the cardiac problem , but the company publicly attacked the findings as incorrect . \u2022 Two FDA safety officials sounded a clear alarm in October 2008 writing , `` There is strong evidence that rosiglitazone -LSB- Avandia -RSB- confers an increased risk of -LSB- heart attacks -RSB- and heart failure compared to pioglitazone -LSB- rival drug on market -RSB- . '' They concluded and trials comparing the two would be `` unethical and exploitive . '' Yet , the trial is still under way , the senators say . GlaxoSmithKline counters that the Senate report relies on outdated information . `` In essence , the report is a compilation of information and events that took place years ago , '' spokeswoman Pekarek said . `` There 's no new data there . '' The FDA has evaluated at the drug , Pekarek said , and updated product labeling in 2007 to say information on Avandia 's relationship to myocardial ischemia is inconclusive . `` The FDA exists to ensure patient safety , '' she said . `` That is their purpose . '' Avandia has been under scrutiny for years . The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug 's safety into question in 2007 . The Journal of the American Medical Association also questioned whether Avandia was safe in 2007 . `` Among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes , rosiglitazone use for at least 12 months is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure , without a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality , '' the AMA journal wrote , adding that the `` findings have potential regulatory and clinical implications . '' `` Regulatory agencies ought to re-evaluate whether rosiglitazone should be allowed to remain on the market , '' the report said . `` Health plans and physicians should not wait for regulatory actions . They should avoid using rosiglitazone in patients with diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular events , especially since safer treatment alternatives are available . '' Read the report In 2007 , an FDA panel recommended by a vote of 22-1 that Avandia should remain on the market despite an analysis showing links to increased risk of heart attack . The vote was not binding , but a suggestion to FDA regulators . The panel also voted 20-3 at the same meeting in support of data that showed Avandia increased the risk of cardiac ischemia in patients with the most common type of diabetes . The Senate report does not address the issue of whether Avandia should be removed from the market .

{"answer":"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tens of thousands of South Koreans were demonstrating Saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government 's decision to import what they say is unsafe U.S. beef . South Korean protesters protest against government 's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday . South Korean police estimate that the crowd in Seoul is about 50,000 . No clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police , although ongoing protests have at times turned violent . South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban . That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003 . The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak , who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his Cabinet . Tens of thousands of auto workers in South Korea went on strike Wednesday to oppose the government 's lifting of the ban . After a series of negotiations , Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old . Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease , which can be transmitted to humans . The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease . The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports . Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals . The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997 . Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare and fatal malady in humans . Until the 2003 ban , South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters . South Korea 's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush . But the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks , along with a sense that South Korea had backed down too easily to American pressure . The government has vowed to get tough with the rallies . In Washington , the White House announced that Bush would visit South Korea on August 5-6 before heading to the Beijing Olympics . Bush had originally been expected to go to Seoul next week when he visits Japan for the G-8 summit , but the trip did not materialize amid the protests .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment , the World Wildlife Fund said Friday . These two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in Australia . The WWF 's latest Living Planet Index shows terrestrial , freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005 , with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop . The index is included in a report called `` 2010 and Beyond : Rising to the Biodiversity Challenge , '' which the WWF prepared for an international biodiversity conference in Germany later this month . `` No one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters , and greater effects from global warming , '' said James Leape , director-general of WWF International . The Living Planet Index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species , which the WWF says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends . Terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period , the WWF said . Marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period , with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005 , the WWF said . `` Many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence , and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world 's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched , '' the WWF report said . Freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003 . The WWF said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet , inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species . In tropical regions , freshwater species were especially hard-hit ; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000 . The WWF said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003 . The causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere , such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems , the WWF said . The dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species ' capacity to replace itself , the WWF said . Overfishing is one example . Overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species , according to the report , which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals . Overharvesting of timber is also a major factor , it said . Invasive species , whether introduced deliberately or not , are another threat , especially in freshwater ecosystems , where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species , the WWF said . Pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity , it said . The WWF called on governments attending this month 's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010 . It wants governments to establish protected areas , particularly those areas important for food security , water supply , medicine , and disaster mitigation , and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020 .","question":""}

Almost half of the world 's most threatened sea turtle species can be found in the northern waters of the Indian Ocean and on nesting beaches lying within Exclusive Economic Zones in countries such as India , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh , according to the report . Threatened populations here include both loggerhead turtles -LRB- classified `` endangered '' by the IUCN Red List -RRB- and ridley turtles -LRB- `` vulnerable '' -RRB- . `` The report confirms that India is a home to many of the most threatened sea turtles in the world , '' B.

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama paid tribute Friday to seven CIA officers killed in Afghanistan in December , calling them `` American patriots who loved their country and gave their lives to defend it . '' Obama delivered the remarks during a memorial service at CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia . The service was closed to the media to protect the identities of undercover officers in attendance . A transcript of Obama 's speech was provided to members of the press . `` There are no words that can ease the ache in your hearts , '' Obama told families , friends and co-workers of the seven officers . `` But to their colleagues and all who served with them -- those here today , those still recovering , those watching around the world , I say : Let their sacrifice be a summons . To carry on their work . To complete this mission . To win this war and to keep our country safe . '' A suicide bomber killed the CIA officers and contractors , as well as a Jordanian intelligence official , on December 30 at a U.S. base in Khost , in southeastern Afghanistan . The bomber was within seconds of being searched by security contractors when he detonated his explosives , a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident said in January . Two of those killed were contractors with private security firm Xe , formerly known as Blackwater , a former intelligence official said . The CIA considers contractors to be officers . Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the greatest loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon , which killed eight agents . `` These remarkable men and women are the story of America , '' CIA Director Leon Panetta said at Friday 's service , according to the transcript . `` They are the heart and soul of this great country . Their devotion to duty is the foundation of our country . '' U.S. and Jordanian officials say the bomber , Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi , had been recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence agent , despite concerns over his extremist views , and was being used in the hunt for a senior al Qaeda figure . The suicide bombing was `` a huge blow , symbolically and tactically , '' because it eliminated so many CIA officers , who can take years to become ingrained in the region , said Reva Bhalla , director of analysis for Stratfor , an international intelligence company . In addition , she said , the attack showed the ability of the Taliban to penetrate perhaps the most difficult of targets : a CIA base .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China is continuing to speak out against a multibillion-dollar U.S. arms sale to Taiwan , with the Chinese foreign minister telling U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Monday that the Obama administration should reconsider the deal . Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met with Clinton in New York , where the United Nations General Assembly is in session , according to a senior State Department official who spoke on background . Yang `` was making very serious representations to Secretary Clinton , asked the Obama administration to reconsider this decision and indicated that it would harm the trust and confidence that was established between the two sides , '' the official said . Chinese officials `` have indicated that they 're going to suspend or to cancel or postpone a series of ... military-to-military engagements , '' the official said . Clinton `` responded very clearly '' that the United States has a strategic interest in stability in the region , and that the Taiwan Relations Act `` provides for a strong rationale for the provision of defensive capabilities and weapons to Taiwan as part of a larger context to preserve that peace and stability , '' the official said . Clinton also told Yang that the United States supports improved relations between mainland China and Taiwan . The $ 5.3 billion arms package includes upgrades to Taiwan 's F-16 fighter fleet , a five-year extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and spare parts for the upkeep of three different planes currently in use by the Taiwanese , according to the State Department . The deal is part of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program . China voiced strong opposition to the deal when it was announced last week , with the state-run Xinhua news agency quoting China 's vice foreign minister , Zhang Zhijun , as saying , `` The wrongdoing by the U.S. side will inevitably undermine bilateral relations as well as exchanges and cooperation in military and security areas . '' China regards Taiwan as a renegade province . Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China , until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949 . The Taiwan Strait separates the mainland from the island . In 1979 , the United States carried out its `` one China '' policy by switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing . But the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the United States to help defend the island if needed . The United States also is Taiwan 's main arms supplier . Beijing broke off military contacts with Washington last year to protest another arms sale to Taiwan . The sale included more than $ 6 billion in Patriot missiles , Black Hawk helicopters and communications equipment , which Taiwan said it needed for self-defense .","question":""}
{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iranian airliner that crashed Wednesday , killing all 168 passengers and crew , plunged into the ground and disintegrated on impact , according to a security official . Debris from the plane was littered around the crash site . Images of the crash site show a smoldering crater scattered with charred pieces of the plane and tattered passports . Ten members of the country 's youth judo team were aboard the Caspian Airlines plane , said several sources , including Iran 's Press TV . The government-backed network said the dead included eight athletes and two coaches . The plane `` disintegrated into pieces , '' said Col. Masood Jafari Nasab , security commander of Qazvin , the city nearest to the crash site in northwestern Iran . `` The aircraft all of a sudden fell out of the sky and exploded on impact , where you see the crater , '' a witness told Press TV from the crash site . Watch images of the crash site '' The plane 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been found , state television reported late Wednesday . The crash was at least the fifth major airline accident in the world this year , following crashes of planes flown by Colgan Air , Turkish Airlines , Air France and Yemenia Airways . A US Airways pilot managed to land his plane safely on the Hudson river in New York City in January , with no major injuries , after the plane lost power . But aviation safety expert John Wiley said there is no reason to fear air travel in general , and no single airline or aircraft is particularly dangerous . The three most recent crashes -- in which a total of 548 people died -- involved different planes , flown by different airlines , in different stages of flight , he said . Caspian Airlines Flight 7908 -- a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M plane -- went down near the village of Jannatabad near Qazvin at 11:33 a.m. -LRB- 2:03 a.m. ET -RRB- Wednesday , Press TV reported . Conversations between the pilot and the ground were normal and did not indicate any technical problems , the network 's Web site reported , citing the managing director of Iran 's airport authority without naming him . Some witnesses say the plane caught fire before crashing , Press TV said . The plane descended very quickly , Wiley told CNN , but it may have been circling , trying to land , rather than plummeting to the ground . Qazvin Police Chief Hossein Behzadpour and Mohammad Reza Montazer Khorasan , the head of the disaster management center in Iran 's health ministry , both confirmed that all 168 people on board died , Press TV reported . The U.S. State Department , in a statement , extended its condolences to the victims . Department spokesman Ian Kelly said officials were working to determine whether any Americans were on board . Aviation analyst Kieran Daly told CNN that many aircraft operating in Iran are aging Tupolevs , some dating back to the 1970s . He described Tupolevs as `` workhorses of the old Soviet aviation system . '' But he said the Caspian Airlines fleet is based on a slightly newer design , dating to the late 1980s and early 1990s . Pictures from the scene were `` consistent with a high-speed impact , '' he said . But he added that there could be large debris not seen on television , and that could change his analysis . Watch Daly talk about the crash '' A team of investigators from the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee is flying to the crash scene to join the investigation , the agency said in a posting on its Web site . They will work alongside Iranian aviation authorities , the agency said . An agency official declined to comment further , saying the plane was operated by an Iranian company and nothing is known about it . A Tupolev representative told CNN the manufacturer will not comment until the aviation committee releases its report on the crash . The Tupolev 154 is essentially banned in the West because it does not comply with European noise and pollution regulations , but it has a safer-than-average accident record , Wiley said . Wednesday 's crash is the first on record for Caspian Airlines , which was founded in 1993 , he added . The Iranian newspaper Hamshahri reported that the plane was flying from Tehran and was headed to Yerevan , Armenia . The semi-official Mehr news agency listed the names of 153 passengers and 15 crew members . At least 42 of the names appeared to be Armenian , but it was not clear if they were from the former Soviet republic or if they were ethnically Armenian citizens of Iran . The plane crashed 16 minutes after takeoff , said the newspaper , quoting a spokesman from Iran 's civil aviation organization . See a map of the crash location '' That would have put the flight in one of the safest stages of travel , according to International Air Transport Association data . Only about 5 percent of accidents take place during the phase called en-route climb , 16 to 20 minutes into a flight , when a plane climbs to a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet . About half of accidents take place during landing . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his condolences to the victims ' families , as did the European Union . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent his sympathies to the presidents of Iran and Armenia , the Kremlin said . Qazvin is the largest city in the province of Qazvin and is its capital , with an estimated population of 330,000 . It is about 90 miles -LRB- 145 kilometers -RRB- northwest of Tehran , the capital of Iran . The last crash in Iran involving a Tupolev plane occurred in 2006 , according to the Web site airdisaster.com . That crash occurred on an Iran Air Tour flight from the port city of Bandar Abbas ; it crashed and caught fire during landing , the Web site reported . Twenty-nine of the 147 people on board died in that crash .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis , who had a storied career in professional football as a coach , commissioner and owner , died Saturday , the team said . He was 82 . In a brief post on their website , the Raiders said a statement would be issued later in the day . The cause of death was not immediately released . Much of Davis ' career was spent in Oakland , where he first arrived as a coach in 1963 -- tasked with turning around a team that was picked to be at the bottom of the standings . The results were almost immediate , finishing 10-4 that season , and Davis was selected as coach of the year .

His career started in 1950 as a line coach at Adelphi College in New York , the Raiders website said . He also coached at The Citadel , Southern California and for the then-Los Angeles Chargers before going to the Raiders . According to the Raiders website , by the time he arrived in Oakland , Davis had already been labeled a `` young coaching genius '' by Sports Illustrated . As commissioner of the American Football League in 1966 , he played a role in the merger of that league with the National Football League . Davis ' story , the Raiders website said , `` is a standard that no one in the history of professional football can match for winning and excellence . '' He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 1992 . `` Al Davis 's passion for football and his influence on the game were extraordinary , '' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on his Twitter account . `` The respect he commanded was evident in the way that people listened carefully every time he spoke . He is a true legend of the game whose impact and legacy will forever be part of the NFL . '' New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson also shared his sympathy on the news of Davis ' death . `` Al Davis was one of the most innovative and dynamic pioneers in the history of the National Football League . He was passionate about his team and about the game of professional football and he personified the legacy of the Raiders , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States , prosecutors said Tuesday . Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb . Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws . Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said . Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals . Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes . Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration . Lawson and Ogren had neither . `` These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , '' said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent . `` This particular animal tested negative , '' he said . Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , `` but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . '' Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States . The journal also described the pair 's `` acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , '' McDevitt 's office said . Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant . `` The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , '' the statement from McDevitt 's office said . Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife . He will be sentenced in January . Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 . The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane , Washington , to Bangkok on November 4-5 , 2007 , with stops in Seattle , Washington , and Inchon , South Korea . They returned on a direct flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles , California , on November 28 , 2007 .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British woman who suffers from multiple sclerosis has lost her appeal to clarify Britain 's laws on assisted suicide , a charity working with the woman said Thursday . Debbie Purdy and husband Omar Puente pictured outside the High Court in October 2008 . But the woman did get a strong hint that anyone who helped her travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal would not be prosecuted . Debbie Purdy , 45 , had asked the Court of Appeal to clarify Britain 's laws on assisted suicide -- an option she has said she wants if her pain one day becomes unbearable . Under the current laws , Purdy says , it is not clear at which point her husband would be breaking the law if he helped her to travel to an assisted suicide clinic . Purdy was appealing an October ruling by the High Court , which also refused to clarify the laws . Purdy suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis , in which symptoms become progressively worse over time . She has said she wants the option to travel abroad to have an assisted death should her condition deteriorate . Under Britain 's current law , Purdy 's husband , Omar Puente , could face 14 years in prison if he accompanies her to a country , such as Switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . Purdy had asked the High Court judges to tell her at what point Puente would be subject to prosecution -- whether it would include helping her into a car , sitting with her on the plane to the clinic , or helping her with her bags . In its judgment Thursday , the appeal court did imply Puente would be safe from prosecution . The judges referred to the earlier case of Dan James , a 23-year-old British rugby player who died in an assisted suicide last year . James had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident . James ' parents , Mark and Julie James , flew with their son to an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland . They faced questions on their return to Britain but were not prosecuted . The court said the decision not to prosecute the Jameses `` is illustrative not only of the care with which the issue in these cases would be approached , but also an extremely helpful example of the kind of broad circumstances in which ... the ultimate decision would be that a prosecution should not be mounted , '' according to an excerpt released by Dignity in Dying , the charity that worked on Purdy 's case . `` If the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process , the court will dismiss it , '' the court said in its judgment . Purdy said that wording made her feel like she had won her argument , even though she lost the appeal . `` I am very grateful for , and respect the ruling of the appeal court , '' she said in a statement . `` They have done everything they can do to clarify that , given the Dan James judgment , Omar would be unlikely to be prosecuted if he were to accompany me abroad for an assisted death , and we are therefore one step closer to the clarification I need . '' Dignity in Dying has said it is important for the British government to distinguish between people who maliciously encourage suicide and those who accompany a loved one abroad to die . Under current law , the 1961 Suicide Act , assisting a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment . Anyone who aids , abets , counsels or procures the suicide of another , or an attempt by another to commit suicide , is liable . Dignity in Dying has said it ultimately wants British law changed to allow the terminally ill the choice of assisted death . To date , no one who has accompanied a loved one to the Swiss clinic Dignitas has been prosecuted , but they have been questioned by police and threatened with prosecution , according to Dignity in Dying . `` The courts have done all they can , '' said Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying . `` They make quite clear that only Parliament has the authority to change the law . If there 's no public interest in prosecuting , there must be a public interest in updating the law to remove doubt . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee . Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday . If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey , which is expected , his nomination will go before the full Senate . A leading Democrat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee . Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales . Gonzales gave up the post in September . `` This is an extremely difficult decision , '' Schumer said . `` When an administration so political , so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge , we are never left with an ideal choice . Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice . However , Judge Mukasey , whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him , is far better than anyone could expect from this administration . '' A number of Democratic senators , however , have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning . Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture . While saying `` serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey 's views on torture and on separation of powers , '' Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership . `` First and foremost , Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales . Rather , he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York . `` I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments , allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress . '' Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination . Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he ca n't support the Mukasey nomination '' `` No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture , '' Leahy said . `` Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition . We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II . `` I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice . I like Michael Mukasey . I wish that I could support his nomination . But I can not . America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one , not even the president , is above the law . '' President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation , an influential conservative think tank . `` In a time of war , it 's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place , '' the president said . The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program , whose details are classified . Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture , but added that Mukasey `` does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy . '' But Leahy said `` Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret ` facts and circumstances . ' '' `` He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal . Our law makes torture illegal , and waterboarding is torture , and it is illegal . It is frankly not dependent on any , quote , ` relevant facts and circumstances of the technique 's past or proposed use , ' '' he said , quoting from Mukasey 's response to senators on the question . Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding . But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition , Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military , according to Human Rights Watch . It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military . E-mail to a friend CNN 's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"TALLAHASSEE , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Florida Gov. Charlie Crist announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election next year and instead will seek the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Mel Martinez . Gov. Charlie Crist appeared alongside Sen. John McCain , left , during the 2008 presidential campaign . Crist , who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate in 1998 , was immediately endorsed by the Senate Republican campaign arm , which hopes to avoid a bruising primary fight . Former state House Speaker Marco Rubio declared his intention last week to seek the GOP Senate nomination . `` Our country is facing the most profound public policy questions in our lifetime -- questions relating to the economy , taxes , healthcare , the environment and national security , '' Crist said in a statement released by his campaign . `` The answers to these questions will have a lasting impact on the country we love and the nation we will leave to our children and grandchildren . '' He added in the statement : `` Here in Florida , we 've shown that when we put people first and work together , much can be accomplished , and I intend to bring that same approach to Washington . That is why , after thoughtful consideration with my wife Carole , I have decided to run for the U.S. Senate . '' A Quinnipiac Poll released last month showed Crist with a commanding 54 percent to 8 percent lead over Rubio in the Republican primary . But the poll also found that more people overall , and Republicans specifically , would rather see Crist run for re-election as governor than seek the Senate seat . Should Crist backers persuade Rubio to abandon his bid , it would help national Republicans focus money and resources on other races in 2010 . The GOP needs to win back seats they lost in 2008 to help weaken the Democratic hold on the Senate . Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter 's decision to change his political affiliation from Republican to Democrat and the increasing likelihood that Democrat Al Franken will eventually be named the next senator from Minnesota means that President Obama will have enough Democratic votes -- in theory -- for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate . Last week , the Senate GOP was dealt a setback when former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge , a popular Republican , decided not to challenge Specter . But news that Crist would enter a Senate race was welcomed by Texas Sen. John Cornyn , who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee . `` While I believe Marco Rubio has a very bright future within the Republican Party , Charlie Crist is the best candidate in 2010 to ensure that we maintain the checks and balances that Floridians deserve in the United States Senate , '' Cornyn said in a statement . `` Governor Crist is a dedicated public servant and a dynamic leader , and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will provide our full support to ensure that he is elected the next United States Senator from Florida . '' Rubio used a short blast on Twitter to chastise the NRSC for siding with Crist in the primary . `` Disappointed GOP senate comm endorses Crist on day 1 , '' Rubio wrote . `` Remember that reform must always come from the outside . Status quo wo n't change itself . '' GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan , who had been considering a Senate bid , instead said he would run for another term in the House and endorsed Crist . Anticipating his entry into the Senate race , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last month aired its first television ad of the 2010 elections -- a small buy in the Tallahassee TV market -- that accused Crist of running away from the state 's economic problems . Florida Democrats echoed that line of criticism Tuesday shortly after Crist declared his candidacy . `` By running for U.S. Senate , Charlie Crist has cut and run on the Sunshine State , once again taking the easy way out , avoiding responsibility and leaving the hard work of facing Florida 's problems to the next governor , '' Florida Democratic Party Chair Karen Thurman said . `` At a time when Florida needs real leadership , unfortunately Charlie Crist is running from the mess he created , which is why Floridians are going to send Crist into retirement come Election Day . '' Still , Crist remains very popular in the state that he has led since he was elected governor in 2006 . His approval rating is at 66 percent , according to the Quinnipiac Poll . While it had been speculated for weeks that Crist would run for the Senate , the governor told reporters Tuesday that he made his final decision this past weekend to run for Martinez 's seat . With conservatives and centrists battling for control of the Republican Party , the upcoming primary contest in Florida will be closely watched nationally . Crist is considered a centrist , while Rubio is trying to appeal to conservatives in the party . When asked to talk about his primary with Rubio and the future direction of the Republican Party , Crist instead spoke about bipartisanship . `` Well , I think what 's important to bear in mind is that we do things a little bit differently here in Florida , and that 's another reason that I run for the United States Senate , '' Crist told reporters at a news conference . `` We work together to solve problems and do what 's right for the people of our state . The people are the boss . And I think regardless of party , we have to work together to get things done . And that 's what I 'd like to take to Washington , D.C. '' Rep. Kendrick Meek , North Miami Mayor Kevin Burns and state Sen. Dan Gelber are all seeking the Democratic Senate nomination .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An international peace conference in Johannesburg has been cancelled after South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend the event . Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he would boycott the conference . Announcing the postponement at a news conference Tuesday , Irvin Khosa , chairman of the South African football league , did not offer an explanation . A presidential spokesman , Thabo Masebe , said little . `` South Africa has made this decision , '' he said . `` We stand by the decision . '' The peace conference had been scheduled to start Friday . Officials said they would like to have a conference in the future , but they did not offer a specific date . The conference had been organized by South African soccer officials , led by Khosa , and was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa 's role as a human-rights champion ahead of the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship the nation will host next year . The presidential spokesman had said earlier that the Dalai Lama -- Tibet 's spiritual leader and a Nobel Laureate -- did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa 's interest for him to attend . Masebe said South Africa thinks that , if the Dalai Lama attended the conference , the focus would shift away from the World Cup . `` We can not allow focus to shift to China and Tibet , '' he said . He added that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China . Khosa made the announcement at a news conference also attended by Chief Mandla Mandela , grandson of former South African President Nelson Mandela . Mandla Mandela said it was a sad day for the country 's democracy and the African continent that the South African government had denied the Dalai Lama a visa . South Africa should not succumb to international pressure , Mandela said . A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the visa refusal . The Tibetan government in exile thinks that China has pressured many countries to refuse a visit by the Dalai Lama , according to Chhime Chhoekyapa , an aide in Dharamsala , India . The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . The peace conference was to bring together Nobel laureates and top soccer officials . Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; former President F.W. De Klerk ; laureates Nelson Mandela and Martti Ahtisaar ; Seff Blatter , president of soccer 's international governing body ; and actress Charlize Theron were among those invited .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The State Department condemned Iran 's persecution of religious minorities on Friday following the Iranian authorities ' detention of Baha'is and Christians in recent months . Iranian authorities have detained more than 45 Baha'is in the last four months , and as many as 60 Baha'is are imprisoned in Iran on the basis of their religion beliefs , the State Department said . Iranians have also recently detained more than a dozen Christians , according to the State Department . `` The United States is increasingly concerned about the Iran 's ongoing persecution of Baha'is and other religious minority communities , '' said Philip J. Crowley , assistant secretary for public affairs , in a statement on Friday . The State Department 's condemnation comes a day after it released a human rights report on Iran that blasted the country 's government for abusing religious minorities , among other criticisms . `` Government rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shia religious groups , most notably for Baha'is , as well as for Sunni Muslims , evangelical Christians , and members of the Jewish community , '' Thursday 's report said . Iran is an Islamic Republic where Shia Islam is the state religion . The Iranian government did not respond directly to the State Department on Thursday or Friday . However , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad criticized the West on Friday for ignoring religious principles like monotheism . At a meeting with Iranian intellectuals , `` the president stressed that -LSB- many -RSB- efforts should be made to ... promote justice and support -LSB- a -RSB- campaign against oppressors and help monotheism flourish , '' Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency reported . Thursday 's State Department report said that Iran 's government prevents Baha'is from gathering in homes to worship and bans Baha'is from public schools , universities , the social pension system and government leadership posts unless they conceal their faith . `` The government repeatedly pressured Baha'is to recant their religious beliefs in exchange for relief from mistreatment , '' the report said . All seven members of Iran 's Baha'i national leadership body , who were arrested in 2008 , remained in prison at the end of 2009 , according to the report . The Baha'i faith was founded in Iran in the 19th century . Today , Baha'is are the country 's largest religious minority , with 300,000 members , according to the official Baha'i Web site . Thursday 's State Department report also accused the Iranian government of destroying a Sufi library and religious hall in Isfahan ; demolishing several Sunni mosques ; and requiring evangelical Christian groups to submit congregation membership lists to the government .

{"answer":"LAS VEGAS , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former gridiron great O.J. Simpson will serve at least nine years in prison for his role in an armed confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel in 2007 . O.J. Simpson told the judge Friday that he was sorry for what he did but did n't think it was wrong . Simpson was sentenced to a maximum of 33 years with the possibility of parole after nine . Before the sentence , he offered a rambling , emotional apology in which he told District Judge Jackie Glass , his voice shaking , that he was sorry for his actions but believed he did nothing wrong . Glass , however , brushed his apology aside , saying his actions amounted to `` much more than stupidity , '' and calling him both arrogant and ignorant . `` Earlier in this case , at a bail hearing , I said to Mr. Simpson , I did n't know if he was arrogant , ignorant or both , '' Glass said . `` During the trial and through this proceeding , I got the answer , and it was both . '' She stressed that the sentence was not `` payback for anything else , '' apparently referring to Simpson 's acquittal 13 years ago in the slayings of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ron Goldman . Watch the judge say the sentence is n't about the past \u00c2 '' Grimacing , Simpson was escorted from the courtroom in shackles . Defense attorneys said Glass ' sentence was appropriate . `` It could have been a lot worse , '' Yale Galanter said , noting that Simpson and co-defendant Clarence `` C.J. '' Stewart both could have been sentenced to life in prison . A jury convicted Simpson , 61 , and Stewart , 54 , on 12 charges including conspiracy to commit a crime , robbery , assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon stemming from a September 13 , 2007 , incident at Las Vegas ' Palace Station hotel and casino . Prosecutors alleged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats , guns and force to take sports memorabilia from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley . Simpson claimed that he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him . All the men except Stewart made deals with prosecutors in exchange for their testimony . `` We 're happy that this case is coming to an end , '' Clark County district attorney David Roger said . `` We 're satisfied that we presented a good case to a jury , that the jury listened to all the evidence , particularly the audiotapes , and came to the resolution that we asked them to come to . '' He said he thought the sentence was fair . Simpson 's conviction came October 3 , the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman . Follow a timeline of Simpson 's legal woes \u00c2 '' Glass said , `` I 'm not here to sentence Mr. Simpson for what 's happened in his life previously in the criminal justice system . ... The jury decided . There are many people who disagree with that verdict , but that does n't matter to me . '' Goldman 's father and sister were in the courtroom for Friday 's sentencing . `` The back of his head looks the same as it did every day that we watched him in the criminal case , and we feel very proud of our efforts , '' Kim Goldman said . `` We feel very strongly that because of our pursuit of him for all these years , that it did drive him to the brink of this . '' Although Simpson was acquitted in the deaths , a civil jury later found him liable , slapping him with a $ 33 million judgment . Attorneys for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued Simpson 's financial assets to pay the judgment . In sentencing Simpson on Friday , Glass noted that he can be heard on tapes of the incident referring to the Goldmans as `` gold-diggers '' and saying he does n't want them to get his property . See how his sentence breaks down \u00c2 '' `` If that pushed him over the edge , great , '' Fred Goldman said afterward . `` Put him where he belongs . '' Watch Fred and Kim Goldman react \u00c2 '' Galanter said he thought the Goldmans ' presence was `` inappropriate . '' `` I do n't think they should have been here , '' he said . `` It reminded us all how the criminal justice system can run afoul , because the only thing Simpson should have been judged on is what happened here in Nevada . '' Denise Brown , the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson , issued a statement on the sentence saying , `` It is very sad to think that an individual who had it all , an amazing career , beautiful wife and two precious children , has ended up like this . `` Allowing wealth , power and control to consume himself , he made a horrific choice on June 12 , 1994 , which has spiraled into where he is today . '' Brown said she was saddened that the couple 's two children `` once again face the tragedy of yet another parent absent in their lives . '' In the statement , she asks for prayers for the children , Sydney and Justin , and the Brown family . Before being sentenced , Simpson told Glass he was `` sorry , somewhat confused , apologetic . '' He said the items he was trying to recover were his late ex-wife 's wedding ring for his daughter and family photos for his son . Watch Simpson 's apology \u00c2 '' `` I just wanted my personal things . I was stupid . I 'm sorry , '' Simpson said . `` I did n't know I was doing anything illegal . I thought I was confronting friends . I thought I was retrieving my things . I did n't mean to hurt anybody , and I did n't mean to steal anything . '' But Glass rejected those statements in imposing the sentence . `` When you take a gun with you and you take men with you ... in a show of force , that 's not just a ` Hey , give me my stuff back , ' '' Glass said . `` That 's something else . And that 's what went on here , and that 's why we 're all here . `` I have to tell you , it was much more than stupidity . ... You went to the room , you took guns -- meaning you and the group -- you used force , you took property , whether it was yours or somebody else 's , and in this state , that amounts to robbery with the use of a deadly weapon . '' The judge said Simpson 's contrite words in court were not as powerful as his angry words , as caught on tape , during the confrontation . `` Everything in this case was on tape , '' Glass said . `` The evidence in this case was overwhelming . '' Simpson 's attorneys asked that he be sentenced to no more than six years . A presentencing report recommended an 18-year term . Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson 's but will be eligible for parole in 7\u00c2 1\/2 years . `` I am as happy as someone could be when they know their client is going to reside for at least seven years in a cage , '' said Stewart 's attorney , Brent Bryson . Defense attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart have said they will appeal . On Friday , Glass denied motions asking that both defendants be allowed out on bail while the appeal is pending .

{"answer":"Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government 's decision Wednesday to speed up construction in East Jerusalem . `` We will continue to build in Jerusalem . This is our right and obligation , '' Netanyahu said at a Knesset memorial ceremony for former tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi , who was assassinated by Palestinian militants a decade ago . `` This is not a punishment -- it is our national right to build our capital . I guarantee that we will never return to the situation we had on the evening of the Six Day War , '' Netanyahu said . His remarks came a day after his government announced it was expediting construction of 2,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and suspending the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue in wake of the Palestinian Authority 's successful membership bid at UNESCO , the U.N. cultural , science , and education agency . British Foreign Minister William Hague released a statement Wednesday condemning the Israeli measures and calling them `` a serious blow to the -LRB- Middle East -RRB- Quartet 's efforts to restart peace negotiations . '' `` This settlement building program is illegal under international law and is the latest in a series of provocative and unhelpful settlement announcements , '' he said in the statement . In Washington , White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama 's administration was `` deeply disappointed '' with Israel 's announcement . `` Unilateral actions work against efforts for direct negotiations '' necessary to achieve a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict , Carney told reporters Wednesday . On Tuesday , a senior Israeli official said the planned construction involves 1,650 units in East Jerusalem and the rest in the West Bank settlements of Efrat and Maaleh Adumin . The construction will take place in areas that are expected to be part of Israeli territory in any future peace agreement , the official said , and there is no contradiction between it and the various peace plans that have been on the table . Palestinians claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said repeatedly that the Palestinians will not return to negotiations until Israel halts all settlement construction and accepts the borders in place before the 1967 Six Day War . Israel , for its part , has maintained that negotiations should begin with no preconditions . `` You can not expect Israel to continue to be restrained when the Palestinian Authority leadership repeatedly slams the door in our face , '' said the Israeli official , who was not authorized to speak to the media . As an example of a door slamming , the official cited the UNESCO bid and the effort to win membership in the United Nations among other instances of Palestinian actions that damaged prospects for a peace deal . The Israeli government has also put a temporary hold on the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue collected by the Israeli government , the official said . Palestinians rely on the revenue to fund government operations , including the payment of public sector salaries . Hague , in his statement , expressed concern about that as well , saying it would have `` direct implications for the Palestinian Authority 's ability to maintain effective security in the West Bank . '' Nabil Abu Rudeineh , Abbas ' spokesman , criticized the Israeli construction announcement Tuesday , calling the decision one `` to accelerate the destruction of the peace process , '' according to WAFA , the Palestinian Authority 's official news agency . Senior Palestinian negotiator Mohamad Ishtayeh also condemned the move . `` Two days ago , they -LRB- the Israeli government -RRB- announced the building of 1 million settlement housing units over the span of 10 years . What Israel decided today was another episode in settlement construction . Using the UNESCO Palestinian membership is only looking for excuses and another way of building settlement housing units . This fits within the overall plan which was announced two days ago before the UNESCO vote , '' he told CNN . Separately on Tuesday , the permanent observer of the Palestinian Authority to the United Nations , Riyad Mansour , said he sent a letter to the U.N. secretary-general and the president of the Security Council about Israel . `` We write today to express our grave concern about the military escalation undertaken by Israel , the occupying Power , against the Gaza Strip , '' he wrote . Within the past four days , Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 11 people and injured many more , Mansour said . Since Saturday , scores of rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza , resulting in the death of one Israeli civilian and the temporary closure of schools and universities in the southern part of the country . The United States said Monday that it would cut funding to UNESCO after the agency voted in support of Palestinian membership . The vote , which required two-thirds approval by UNESCO members , passed with 107 in favor , 14 against , and 52 abstentions . It was the first such vote by a part of the world body and is separate from the Palestinian bid for full membership in the United Nations . After Monday 's vote , Palestinian officials told CNN they are considering the pursuit of membership in other international groups , such as the World Health Organization . `` Instead of sitting around the negotiating table , '' Netanyahu said after the vote , Palestinian leaders `` have decided to make an alliance with Hamas and are carrying out one-sided endeavors in the U.N. , including today . We will not sit with folded arms against these measures which are hurting Israel and are violating bluntly the most basic obligations the parties took in the peace process , to solve the conflict between us through negotiations .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness has spread to more passengers on a U.S. cruise ship , with nearly 450 falling sick while at sea , the cruise company said Tuesday . The Celebrity Cruises ship Mercury departed Charleston , South Carolina , February 15 and headed for the eastern Caribbean , according to a Celebrity Cruises statement . On the way , 419 of the 1,838 passengers fell ill , along with 27 of the 849 crew members , the cruise line said . The number of affected passengers increased from the 353 reported the day before . Their symptoms included upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea , Celebrity Cruises spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said . Guests who were in isolation while ill will receive compensation , she said . The sickened passengers and crew have been administered over-the-counter medicine and are responding well , Celebrity Cruises said . But it is still unclear how they became sick , Martinez said . Medical samples will be sent to a lab for testing Tuesday , she added . The ship 's medical facility first started treating guests Sunday , Martinez said , and by Monday , hundreds of others were sick , too , Celebrity Cruises reported . A doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff Monday to help with the overload of patients when the ship stopped in Tortola , British Virgin Islands , according to the statement . The ship does not return to Charleston until Friday and will be at sea until then , Martinez said . To control the outbreak , the crew has stepped up cleaning of the ship , which is advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurs . Norovirus commonly causes viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships , the CDC says . It can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink , by touching objects infected by people who are already sickened , or through close contact with people who are infected , according to the CDC . So far this year , three gastrointestinal illness outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at a U.S. port , according to the CDC . Norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the Mercury in 2009 , the CDC reported . The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people onboard the cruises carrying at least 100 passengers for anytime between three days to three weeks .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's chief presidential campaign strategist is quitting his post amid criticism of his public relations firm 's contacts with the Colombian government over a pending free-trade deal , Clinton 's campaign announced . Mark Penn will continue to advise Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign . Mark Penn and his political consulting firm will continue to advise the New York senator 's Democratic presidential bid , but Penn will give up his job as chief strategist , campaign manager Maggie Williams said . `` After the events of the last few days , Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the Clinton campaign , '' Williams said . Clinton did not answer reporters ' questions about Penn 's exit during a campaign stop in New Mexico on Sunday . Penn is CEO of public relations giant Burson-Marsteller and is president of Penn , Schoen and Berland , his political consulting firm . Friday , he acknowledged he had met with the Colombian ambassador to the United States earlier in the week in his role as Burson-Marsteller 's chief to discuss the pending U.S.-Colombia trade pact , which Clinton has criticized on the campaign trail . Penn called the meeting `` an error in judgment that will not be repeated , '' and apologized . That prompted Colombia 's government to fire the company Saturday , calling the remarks `` a lack of respect to Colombians . '' Clinton and top aides were sharply critical of rival Democrat Barack Obama in February when reports indicated that his top economic adviser had suggested to a Canadian official that Obama was not as supportive of changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement as the Illinois senator claimed to be on the campaign trail . Penn said Friday that Clinton 's opposition to the U.S.-Colombia pact , which the Bush administration is trying to push through Congress , `` is clear and was not discussed '' during his meeting with the ambassador . And Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said Penn 's meeting was `` not in any way done on behalf of the campaign . '' But Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell -- a key Clinton backer in his state 's April 22 primary -- suggested Sunday that Penn needed to go . `` I think you 've got to make it very clear for someone who is a consultant , who you are representing and who you are not representing , and I would hope that Mr. Penn , when he talked to the Colombians , made that clear . And it does n't sound to me like he did , and that 's something the campaign should take into question , '' Rendell told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' Sources in the Clinton campaign said that Penn realized this weekend that he needed to step aside , and that Clinton was disappointed that he had met with the Colombians .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk was deported to Germany on Monday evening after he was removed from his Cleveland , Ohio-area home in the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers earlier in the day . German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp . An ambulance transported him to an airstrip at the Cleveland airport . The plane carrying Demjanjuk departed at 7:13 p.m. Demjanjuk , 89 , is wanted by German authorities for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor , a Nazi death camp in Poland . His deportation closed a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history . It also sets the stage for what likely will prove to be an extraordinary German war crimes trial . The Supreme Court last Thursday denied a stay of deportation for Demjanjuk . Justice John Paul Stevens without comment refused to intervene in the planned transfer from the United States . Federal courts have all rejected his appeals , and the order from Stevens cleared the way for the Justice Department to move ahead with the deportation . Demjanjuk 's lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he is too ill and frail to be sent overseas . They also raised human rights and other legal issues in their last-minute appeal . A German court last Wednesday had also ruled against a request for a stay . Officials in Berlin have issued an arrest warrant charging Demjanjuk with being an accessory to the murder of about 29,000 civilians at Sobibor in 1943 . The native Ukrainian has long claimed he was a prisoner of war , not a death camp guard . Immigration officers previously entered Demjanjuk 's Cleveland-area home April 14 , and carried him out in his wheelchair to a waiting van . He was held for a few hours and then returned to his residence after a federal appeals court ruled temporarily in his favor . Demjanjuk had appealed unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court last year . He was once accused by the United States and Israel of being a notoriously brutal S.S. guard at the Treblinka camp known as `` Ivan the Terrible . '' After appeals , that allegation was eventually dropped by both countries , but later other allegations were made against him .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones , it 's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well . Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes , from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030 . The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant , or as its design suggests , more of a dog tag . It 's been available for a while now , but we think it 's still worth it . The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $ 39.99 . Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset , the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile . The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant . Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick , the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it . All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid . They are the Play\/Pause key , the track shuffle keys , the volume controls , plus the multifunction Call key . The keys are all made of rubber , and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel . The 3.5 mm headset jack is on the right spine , while the charger jack is on the bottom . On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard . Also on the top is a tiny microphone . Getting the headset set up is pretty simple . Just power it on via the multifunction Call button , and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone . We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem . From there , we could play\/pause tracks , skip songs , and adjust the volume , all from the Jabra BT3030 . The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear , but since it has a 3.5 mm headset jack , you can use any headphones of your choosing . Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music , you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command . When there 's an incoming call during music playback , the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone . You can then hit the Call button to answer the call . After you hang up , the music will resume from the paused point . Other features include call-waiting support , the ability to reject calls , plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone , and vice versa . Sound quality was quite good , and comparable to most MP3 players on the market . The bass was a little weak , but the overall quality was decent . Call quality was mixed . While we heard our callers just fine , we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us . They reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well . This seemed to vary from caller to caller , however , so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it . The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory , plus an AC adapter . It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time , 7 hours music streaming , and 9.58 days standby time . \u00a9 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. . All rights reserved .

North Carolina bans sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members . In response to a subpoena from state Attorney General Roy Cooper , `` MySpace turned over the names , IP and e-mail addresses of 2,116 convicted North Carolina sex offenders found on its social networking Web site , '' Cooper 's office said in a written statement . Cooper has requested similar information from Facebook , another popular social networking site , the statement said . MySpace has told North Carolina authorities that the sex offenders it identified have been removed from the site . North Carolina 's State Bureau of Investigation is sharing the sex offenders ' information with all 100 sheriffs in the state , Cooper 's office said . `` It 's no secret that child predators are on these Web sites , '' Cooper said in the statement . `` Turning over information about these predators to law enforcement helps , but MySpace , Facebook and other social networks need to do much more to protect kids online . '' North Carolina passed a law last year banning sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members , making it a felony offense . Sex offenders on social networking sites is not a new issue . Last month , Newsweek magazine reported that Facebook said it had removed 5,585 convicted sex offenders from its site between May 2008 and January 2009 . MySpace also announced it had removed 90,000 sex offenders in a two-year period , the magazine said . Last June , the Texas attorney general 's office said it had arrested seven convicted sex offenders who violated their parole conditions by creating MySpace profiles , according to an article on the TechNewsWorld Web site . Cooper and Richard Blumenthal , Connecticut 's attorney general , for more than three years have led a group of attorneys general in working to make social networking safer , Cooper 's office said . The group is pushing social networks to use technology such as age and identity verification to better protect users who may be children . After discussions with the group , MySpace became the first social networking site to develop technology aimed at finding and removing sex offenders , the North Carolina statement said . Cooper is pushing Facebook to take similar steps . But , Cooper 's office said , `` the information provided by MySpace does not include sex offenders who have not been convicted , are not registered or may be using aliases on the site . Cooper remains concerned about other sex offenders on the site who may be lying about who they are , and is continuing to ask MySpace to do more to protect children on the site . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The House of Representatives approved a plan Friday that would pave the way for an eventual repeal of the military 's controversial `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy , which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service . The measure passed in a largely party-line , 229-186 vote as part of a larger defense authorization bill despite a growing controversy over allegations of wasteful spending in the legislation . Most Democrats backed the bill while most Republicans opposed it . Attention now shifts to the Senate , where the Armed Services Committee approved a `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' repeal earlier in the week . As in the House , the committee was divided sharply along partisan lines . The plan is a compromise under which the repeal would occur only after a military review of the question and subsequent approval by Obama , the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Opponents of the repeal language argue the military should first carry out the review ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates that is scheduled to be completed in December . Only then would military leaders have the necessary information from force members to develop a plan for carrying out the repeal , they claim . Under the compromise , the military would be given time to complete its review as sought by Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. Mike Mullen . Gates and Mullen both said this week they could accept the compromise language . A recent CNN poll seemed to suggest that Americans are ready for the change . The CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday indicated that 78 percent of the public supports allowing openly gay people to serve in the military , with one in five opposed . Threatening to derail the plan , however , is House members ' insistence on spending almost $ 500 million on a fighter engine that neither the White House nor the Pentagon wants . Funding for the engine was included in the House 's version of the legislation but not the Senate 's . A White House spokesman warned before the House vote on Friday that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if funding for the engine is n't removed . Gates has blasted the proposed funding for the extra F-35 Joint Strike Fighter engine , calling it a `` waste of money '' that does n't meet the fighter 's performance needs . The chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee said Friday that he hopes Obama would n't veto the plan if Congress failed to remove the controversial funding . `` It 's difficult to believe the president would do anything other than look at the entire bill , not just one provision , '' said Sen. Carl Levin , D-Michigan . Levin would n't predict if the engine funding would still be in the bill by the time it reaches Obama 's desk . `` We are a long way from having a product , '' he said . `` Some of the things which I would think -LRB- Obama -RRB- may not like may be dropped along the way . '' Supporters of repealing the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy have been pressuring congressional Democrats to act now , fearing the party will lose its House or Senate majority in November 's midterm election and be unable to pass the measure afterward . The compromise emerged late Monday from a meeting at the White House involving administration officials , gay rights groups and Pentagon officials , sources told CNN . There were also talks on Capitol Hill involving White House lawyers , Pentagon officials and staff from the offices of influential House and Senate Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the sources added . A senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the Pentagon review process told CNN it is well under way , with a survey going out shortly to about 70,000 troops and families to solicit their views . In addition , the official said , town hall meetings already have been held around the country and more are expected , while a website provides a place for troops to write in their views . The military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement the repeal in terms of housing , medical and marriage benefits , as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy , the official said . A major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman , the official added .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The push to overhaul health care received a major boost Thursday as the American Medical Association and AARP endorsed legislation drafted by top House Democrats . The AARP , the nation 's largest organization of older Americans , is a nonpartisan group that advocates for people 50 and older . The AMA , historically an opponent of health care reform , is considered one the nation 's most influential doctors ' advocacy groups . `` I want to thank both organizations again for their support , and I urge Congress to listen to AARP , listen to the AMA and pass this reform for hundreds of millions of Americans who will benefit from it , '' President Obama said at the White House . The backing of those two groups comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , oversees final changes to the $ 1.1 trillion health care bill . The measure likely will come to a final vote Saturday . Read the House health care bill -LRB- PDF -RRB- A 42-page manager 's amendment on the health care legislation posted Tuesday night made mostly technical changes in the nearly 2,000-page bill compiled from three Democratic proposals passed by three House committees . By making the changes public Tuesday , House Democratic leaders could open floor debate on the bill Friday , while fulfilling their pledge to allow 72 hours of review before bringing the measure to the full chamber . Pelosi insisted Thursday she will have the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill . Meanwhile , President Obama is set to huddle Saturday with congressional Democrats on Capitol Hill to review the legislation . Check out the key parts of the bill In a statement , AARP CEO Barry Rand said , `` We started this debate more than two years ago with the twin goals of making coverage affordable to our younger members and protecting Medicare for seniors . `` We can say with confidence that -LSB- the House bill -RSB- meets those goals with improved benefits for people in Medicare and needed health insurance market reforms to help ensure every American can purchase affordable health coverage . '' The AMA 's president , Dr. J. James Rohack , told reporters Thursday that the legislation is `` not a perfect representation of our views '' but is close enough to warrant his group 's support and keep the reform process moving forward . Rohack said the bill needs to be accompanied by legislation reversing scheduled Medicare reimbursement payment reductions to physicians . Responding to the AMA endorsement , Obama said the doctors ' group is `` supporting reform because -LSB- its members have -RSB- seen firsthand what 's broken about our health care system , '' Obama said . `` They would not be supporting it if they really believed that it would lead to government bureaucrats making decisions that are best left to doctors . '' Watch Obama say health care reform is moving forward Meanwhile , House Republicans on Thursday continued to signal their opposition to the measure . GOP leaders held a rally on Capitol Hill along with `` Tea Party '' movement protesters and other activists to warn that the House legislation would translate into a full-blown government takeover of the health care system . Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minnesota , told CNN 's `` American Morning '' on Thursday that Democrats had forgotten the lessons of August 's town hall meetings when angry conservatives criticized health care legislation . `` I think what we 're going to see is the town hall coming to Washington , D.C. , just to remind members of Congress -LSB- that -RSB- we 're the ones we would like you to pay attention to , not lobbyists . And we do n't want the government to own our health care , '' Bachmann said . Speaking at Thursday 's opposition rally , actor John Ratzenberger , who played Cliff on the sitcom `` Cheers , '' slammed the Democratic bill as a form of socialism . `` These are Woodstock Democrats , '' Ratzenberger said . `` We have to remember where their philosophy comes . It does n't come from America . It comes from overseas . It comes from socialism . And socialism is a philosophy of failure . '' House Democrats have rejected an alternative $ 60 billion Republican plan as inadequate for meeting the goals of expanding health coverage to most of the nation 's 46 million uninsured while bringing down costs and ending controversial industry practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . Pelosi 's bill would extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered Americans and guarantee that 96 percent of Americans have coverage , according to the Democratic leadership . The claim is based on an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . Among other things , the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer Americans and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage . It also would cap annual out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . Pelosi 's office has said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $ 30 billion over the next decade . The measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid . Specifically , individuals with annual incomes more than $ 500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $ 1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge . Growth in Medicare expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually . The House bill also includes a government-run public option . Under the House plan , health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government . Pelosi and other liberal Democrats had argued for a more `` robust '' public option that would tie reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to Medicare rates plus a 5 percent increase . Several Democrats representing rural areas , however , killed the proposal after complaining that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula . One thorny issue yet to be resolved among House Democrats is the bill 's final language on abortion . Rep. Bart Stupak , D-Michigan , has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under the health care overhaul . Stupak has vowed that if he is n't allowed a vote on the issue , a group of 40 anti-abortion Democrats will work to block the bill from getting to the House floor . The House bill differs from legislation the Senate is considering in a number of critical ways . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan . An $ 829 billion bill recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would impose a new tax on high-end health care policies , which critics have dubbed `` Cadillac '' plans . A large number of House Democrats are opposed to taxing those policies , arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits . Individuals under the $ 829 billion Finance Committee plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 . The House bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income . Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans . The Finance Committee bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers received a government subsidy for insurance . The House legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue . Democratic leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an anti-trust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II . Reid refused earlier this week to predict when the chamber would pass a health care bill , possibly signaling difficulty in generating support from his entire Democratic caucus .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of protesters in cities across the United States waved American flags as they rallied Saturday against Arizona 's tough new immigration law and pushed for national immigration reform . `` Si se puede , '' `` Yes we can '' and `` Boycott Arizona '' were common refrains for groups protesting from Los Angeles , California , to New York City . May 1 is traditionally a rallying day for supporters of immigration reform . But protesters across the country said they were galvanized by Arizona 's recent passage of a law cracking down on illegal immigration . The new Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the United States illegally . Critics say it will lead to discrimination and racial profiling . But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with Mexico , allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state . She said changes to the law she approved Friday , which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance , should eliminate concerns about racial profiling . But criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of Los Angeles on Saturday , where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out . `` Does my face look illegal ? '' one sign read . Karen Rayner , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department , said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration 's peak . Rayner said the rally was `` very peaceful '' and no one was arrested . Police arrested about 20 protesters -- including a U.S. congressman -- at Saturday 's rally in Washington . Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D-Illinois , was among a group of protesters who were arrested for blocking the sidewalk outside the White House in what they said was a planned act of civil disobedience . The protesters wore T-shirts that read `` ARREST ME NOT MY FAMILY '' and `` ARREST ME NOT MY FRIENDS . '' A smaller group of about 200 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Phoenix , protesting the new law and asking the federal government to step in to stop it . About 1,000 people gathered in New York City 's Union Square on Saturday afternoon . Cesar Mack , an international studies student at City College of New York , told CNN he was an undocumented immigrant from Peru . `` I 've been living in this country six years and I 'm still fighting for immigration reform , '' he said . CNN iReporter Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere said he saw signs in Arabic , French , Spanish and English at the New York rally . One sign in the crowd particularly caught his eye : `` Todos somos Arizona '' -- `` We are all Arizona . '' `` They were trying to convey that message that it 's a city and nation based on immigration . Everybody came from somewhere else , '' he said .

Campaign Finance - Review the details of a court case that could impact U.S. elections . Purifying Invention - Find out how one inventor hopes to quench concerns about clean water . Transcript THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED . CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : On HLN , online , on iTunes ; here , there and everywhere , this is CNN Student News ! Thank you for spending part of your Thursday with us . From the CNN Center , I 'm Carl Azuz . First Up : Health Care Address AZUZ : First up , health care reform reclaims the spotlight as President Obama takes up the issue in a speech to Congress . This debate has been heating up for months , with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions . It 's an incredibly complicated issue , so we 're gon na look at some of the main points right now . Some people think the country 's health care system is fine the way it is . Others think it 's broken , but what they do n't agree on is how to fix it . For example , how much would it cost to reform the system , and where would that money come from ? Should there be a government-run health insurance program ? And if so , how might that impact private insurance companies ? Those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers . President Obama says he is n't the first president to take on health care , but he hopes to be the last . He 's been pushing for reform since he took office , and he believes the time for action is now . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : The time for bickering is over . The time for games has passed . Now is the season for action . Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do . Now is the time to deliver on health care . Health Care Response AZUZ : After the president wrapped up his address to Congress , the Republican Party offered a response from U.S. Representative Charles Boustany . The Louisiana representative , who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon , says he agrees with parts of President Obama 's plan . But he thinks it also presents several problems . Last night , he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs . REP. CHARLES BOUSTANY JR , -LRB- R -RRB- LOUISIANA : We need to establish tough liability reform standards , encourage speedy resolution of claims , and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care . Real reform must do this . Let 's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines . I and many other Republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance . Shoutout GEORGE RAMSAY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! Stephen Breyer , Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas are all members of what governmental body ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it : A -RRB- Congress , B -RRB- The U.S. Supreme Court , C -RRB- President Obama 's Cabinet or D -RRB- The Federal Reserve ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Along with six other justices , these people compose the U.S. Supreme Court . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! Campaign Finance AZUZ : It 's their job to interpret our country 's laws , and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections , including the ones coming up next year ! It 's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates . Right now , there 's a limit on that , but some people argue that violates the Constitution . Elaine Quijano is on the case . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR `` HILLARY , THE MOVIE '' : Who is Hillary Clinton ? ELAINE QUIJANO , CNN CORRESPONDENT , WASHINGTON , D.C. : It started small . During last year 's presidential primaries , a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-Hillary Clinton movie by an advocacy group , a non-profit corporation . FROM CITIZENS UNITED AD FOR `` HILLARY , THE MOVIE '' : If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton , wait 'til you see the movie . QUIJANO : But now , the Supreme Court could make a monumental change in how money influences politics , deciding , in the name of free speech , whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending . FRED WERTHEIMER , DEMOCRACY 21 , CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM SUPPORTER : Allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy . QUIJANO : Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process . WERTHEIMER : The little guy would have no role here , because the dominant force in our politics , the dominant force in Washington decision-making , would become corporations . QUIJANO : But David Bossee of Citizens United , the group behind the anti-Hillary Clinton movie , argues that anyone pooling resources , including unions , the health industry , advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association , has free speech rights . DAVID BOSSEE , CITIZENS UNITED : I actually went out and looked for this fight , because I do n't believe the government should have the right to impede people 's entry into the process . And that 's what the Federal Election Commission is trying to do here , squelch our first Amendment Rights . QUIJANO : Interestingly , the American Civil Liberties Union agrees . A final ruling is expected in a couple of months , and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key , with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional . Elaine Quijano , CNN , the Supreme Court . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- Flash Flooding AZUZ : Six months ' worth of rain in two days ! That is what residents in parts of Turkey are dealing with . This massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week , claiming more than 30 lives . In this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low-lying valley . It flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks . Hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea . The country 's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods . He 's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it . I.D. Me RAMSAY : See if you can I.D. Me ! I 'm a rock band originally from Liverpool , England . I made my first U.S. appearance in 1964 . 20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the U.S. charts . And I was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 . I 'm the Beatles : John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr ! The Beatles : Rock Band AZUZ : They were a rock band . Now the Beatles are in Rock Band ! A new game featuring the famous Fab Four is out this week . It lets players jam out on dozens of the group 's biggest hits . Plus , it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll 's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band 's last gig . That 's not the only reason the Beatles are back in the spotlight . All 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves . Purifying Invention AZUZ : Meanwhile , a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own . But we 're not talking about digital , we 're talking liquid . More than a billion people around the globe do n't have access to clean drinking water . Sure , there 're water water everywhere , but if it 's not clean , it can cause serious consequences . Gary Tuchman looks at one idea designed to quench the problem . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- GARY TUCHMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Water : It 's the most abundant resource on the planet , yet every year , millions of people die because they do n't have access to clean water . So Dean Kamen , the inventor of the Segway , decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the `` Slingshot . '' DEAN KAMEN , INVENTOR : We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem : bad water . TUCHMAN : He says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling , distilling and vaporizing it . KAMEN : In goes the bad , and as you can see , out comes the good . That is pure water . TUCHMAN : The machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems , making it more portable . KAMEN : It 's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world . TUCHMAN : Kamen says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function . But until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down , Slingshots wo n't be available to the people who need them most . KAMEN : We 've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water , that we 've all come to take for granted , but we 'll not be able to do that in the future . TUCHMAN : Gary Tuchman , CNN . -LRB- END VIDEO -RRB- Before We Go AZUZ : Before we leave you today , we 've got a story about something that 's pretty darn fast . Usian Bolt may be the quickest person on the planet , but he 's got nothing on Sarah . The cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world 's fastest land mammal . She made the 100-meter dash in 6.16 seconds . Then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt . Now for reference , sprinter Usain Bolt did it in 9.58 seconds . So , cheetah wins . Think you could outrun her ? You 're welcome to give it a shot . Goodbye AZUZ : But you 've got to make sure that she does n't break any rules . After all , she 's a cheetah . Okay , we know a lot of you probably saw that coming , but you just ca n't miss the opportunity to make a cheetah pun . It 's where we cross the finish line for today , but we 'll be back tomorrow to close out the week . We look forward to seeing you then . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .","question":""}
{"answer":"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A boy playing with matches started a Southern California wildfire that scorched more than 38,000 acres , the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department said Tuesday . A firefighter talks on a radio while battling the Buckweed blaze on October 22 . The Buckweed Fire , which destroyed 21 homes on its rampage , began October 21 in the Agua Dulce community . `` Our arson explosive detectives , in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Fire Department investigators , immediately began their investigation , and during the course of the investigation , it led to a juvenile suspect , '' Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Deputy Tony Moore told CNN 's `` American Morning '' Wednesday . `` After talking with that juvenile , he admitted to playing with matches , and accidentally starting the fire in that area , '' he said . Watch what 's next for young suspect '' The boy , whose name and age were not given , is home with his parents , police said . The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney for possible charges . According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection , the Buckweed Fire burned 38,526 acres . Sixty-three structures , 21 of them homes , were destroyed , and three civilians and two firefighters were injured . The sheriff 's department said the fire forced the evacuation of about 15,000 people . As of Tuesday , 18 of 23 wildfires in Southern California were completely under control , and the remainder were at least 70 percent contained , according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . The fires are blamed for 14 deaths and charred more than 508,000 acres , destroying about 1,600 homes . Five people were arrested in arson probes last week , and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday vowed to `` hunt down '' people responsible for setting wildfires . Authorities said Saturday they were following 1,700 tips about a white Ford F-150 pickup seen near the origin of the sprawling Santiago Fire in Orange County . Witnesses reported seeing the 1998-2004 model truck with chrome tubular running boards on Santiago Canyon Road on October 21 at about the time the Santiago Fire started . Authorities said last week they had found evidence at the scene , although they declined to describe it . `` If I were one of the people who started the fires , I would not sleep soundly right now , because we 're right behind you , '' Schwarzenegger said , urging the culprits to turn themselves in .

{"answer":"Riyadh , Saudi Arabia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nayef bin Abdulaziz , Saudi Arabia 's interior minister , has been named the new crown prince of the key oil-producing nation , ascending at a time of regional turmoil amid the populist Arab Spring movement and simmering international issues involving Iran and other neighbors . The news , following a royal decree signed by King Abdullah , was announced early Friday on state-run Saudi Television . The official Saudi Press Agency reported that the decree was issued the previous evening . Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud , the king 's half-brother , died in a New York hospital on Saturday after being ill for some time . His funeral was held three days later in Riyadh . As was the case with his predecessor , the move makes Nayef bin Abdulaziz the heir to the Saudi throne . He will assume his new post at a tension-filled time in the Arab world . The longtime leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya have fallen in recent months during the so-called Arab Spring , while those in Yemen , Syria and elsewhere are holding on to power despite continuing popular unrest . Violence remains a problem in neighboring Iraq , as well as Afghanistan . Iran , a longtime rival of the Saudi royal family 's , is still at odds with much of the international community over its nuclear program , among other issues . Before the announcement , Nayef had been considered a likely successor to his brother as crown prince . He was named in 2009 as second deputy prime minister , a post held by the second in line to the throne . Nayef has served as the Saudi interior minister since 1975 , having overseen the kingdom 's counterterrorism efforts . Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries that has truly dismantled a domestic al Qaeda network , said Christopher Boucek , a Saudi expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . '' Nayef is widely seen as a hard-line conservative who , at best , is lukewarm to King Abdullah 's reform initiatives , '' read a classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks . In addition to his new title , Nayef will remain interior minister , according to Friday 's announcement . The Saudi Press Agency noted that he also has been appointed deputy premier , meaning he will officially hold three positions in the Saudi government . He and others met Thursday with a U.S. delegation that included Vice President Joe Biden , CIA Director David Petraeus and Sen. John McCain . Ascension to the Saudi throne is kept within the royal family , though it does not pass from father to son . Instead , it 's a complex process , and decisions in the conservative kingdom are often cloaked in secrecy . Nayef 's appointment follows the first-ever convening of the Allegiance Council , which the king established in 2006 to discuss and allow for more transparency on succession issues . The king made his decision after receiving their input . Afterward , Abdullah instructed Nayef 's fellow princes to pledge allegiance to him as the new crown prince .

Ricin is made from castor beans . The toxin comes in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid , according to the CDC . It works by getting inside the cells of the body and preventing them from making the proteins they need . As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult .

Holli Chmela , 27 , was last heard from when she and a fellow journalist left Beirut , Lebanon , on October 1 . Holli Chmela , 27 , and her male companion , Taylor Luck , 23 , arrived in Lebanon on September 29 from Amman , Jordan , the embassy said . They left Beirut on October 1 , telling friends they were headed for the northern Lebanese cities of Byblos and Tripoli that day . No one has reported any contact with them since then , the embassy said . `` They were then to cross by land to Syria before returning to Jordan , '' the embassy said . `` Chmela and Luck were due to report to work in Jordan on October 4 . '' Luck is an editor with The Jordan Times in Amman , and Chmela had been working as a freelancer for the newspaper , said Sameer Barhoum , the paper 's editor .

{"answer":"Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Palestinian negotiators put forward proposals on security and borders during talks with Israeli representatives in Jordan , Palestinian media reported Tuesday . Israel 's special envoy , attorney Yitzhak Molcho , and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat met in Amman with representatives of the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States , the European Union , the United Nations and Russia -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock . Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters that `` serious and constructive talks '' had taken place , the official Palestinian Authority news agency WAFA said . He said the talks focused on the two-state solution , according to the Jordanian state news agency Petra . The Israelis said they would consider the Palestinian proposals , and the two sides agreed to meet again in Jordan , the agency cited Judeh as saying . However , no significant breakthrough was made , Judeh acknowledged . `` The gap is wide between the two sides on all issues , '' he is quoted as saying by WAFA . `` The issues are complicated and we do not expect to resolve them in a day or two . '' Petra quoted Judeh as saying , `` We do n't want to raise the expectations about this meeting and we do n't want to underestimate its importance in the same time . '' Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians fell apart more than a year ago over disagreements on the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank . In September , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made a bid for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state , a move Israel called premature without direct talks to address its long-standing security concerns . Filling the vacuum created by the removal of Egypt 's former President Hosni Mubarak , Jordan 's King Abdullah has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians . In November , King Abdullah made a rare visit to the Palestinian political capital of Ramallah in the West Bank , followed by a meeting in Amman a week later with Israeli President Shimon Peres . The United States has voiced its support for the new initiative . `` We are hopeful that this direct exchange can help move us forward on the pathway proposed by the Quartet , '' Hillary Clinton , the U.S. secretary of state , said Sunday night in a statement . `` The status quo is not sustainable and the parties must act boldly to advance the cause of peace . '' But while both sides thanked the Jordanian government for its role in bringing about the meeting , few expected any serious breakthroughs . Speaking to Voice of Palestine radio beforehand , Erakat said the meeting would not constitute the resumption of negotiations , but rather would be one that could lead to the restarting of talks . Former Quartet participant and American diplomat Robert Danin wrote Sunday for the Council on Foreign Relations that , while the resumption of contacts between the two sides would be a positive development , it `` inadvertently makes the situation on the ground riskier . '' `` Abbas is returning to talks without attaining his long-standing demand that negotiations resume with an Israeli settlement freeze , '' Danin wrote . `` Unless he can demonstrate quickly that talks produce tangible benefits for the Palestinians , he will feel compelled to break them off . '' This , Danin said , could add impetus to Abbas concluding ongoing talks with Hamas about forming a Palestinian unity government -- an idea vehemently opposed by representatives of Israel and the United States , who consider the Islamist group a terrorist organization . Sami Abu Zuhri , a spokesman for Hamas , said Monday he was surprised by the meetings . He said Hamas considered them a repetition of a failed initiative and called on the Palestinian Authority to cancel the meeting Tuesday with Israeli representatives . Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told CNN that the meeting of the Palestinians with the Israeli occupying forces `` is a mockery . '' Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN last week that `` if Mahmoud Abbas walks toward Hamas , he is walking away from peace .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Several hundred Sri Lankan Tamil protesters shouted slogans at the British Parliament for a second day Tuesday , urging it to act to end the `` genocide '' against their people in Sri Lanka . Police clash with Tamil protesters outside the Houses of Parliament . `` Stop the genocide ! '' they shouted . `` Stop the war ! '' They waved the red flag of Tamil Eelam , the Tamils ' traditional homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka . The flag is emblazoned with a yellow roaring tiger . Most of the protesters slept overnight on the streets around Parliament Square after beginning their unauthorized protest Monday afternoon . At one point , the protesters blocked the street leading to Westminster Bridge over the River Thames , police said . That led to road closures around Parliament . By Tuesday morning , a solid ring of police had hemmed the protesters in Parliament Square across the street from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben . Roads were open again , but the protest and police presence caused traffic congestion in the area . Hariram Shan , 24 , is a Sri Lankan Tamil who said he has lived in Britain for six years . He said the protesters hope the British government will intervene to stop Sri Lanka 's crackdown on Tamil Tiger rebels , which he said harms civilians . `` They can force economic sanctions , '' Shan told CNN . Dushyanthy Sukumar , 47 , said the Sri Lankan government is retaliating against innocent civilians . `` The Sri Lankan government has now cornered the rebels , the LTTE -LRB- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -RRB- , and what they are doing is killing the people , '' she said . Sukumar , who said she has lived in Britain since leaving her homeland in 1987 , said she is angry at the British government for supporting Sri Lanka . `` The Sri Lankan government is doing their dirty work through this government , '' she said . The Sri Lankan military said Sunday that it had captured the last rebel stronghold and killed five rebel leaders after three days of gunbattles . It said more rebels could still be hiding in a 20-square-kilometer `` safety zone , '' but that it would not enter the area because it is home to some 50,000 people . The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 for an independent homeland for the country 's ethnic Tamil minority . The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead .","question":""}
{"answer":"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About 220 Zimbabweans congregated outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare on Thursday , seeking refuge from election-related violence , embassy spokesman Mark Weinberg said . People seeking refuge sit on a curb and sidewalk outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare on Thursday . By evening , embassy officials were moving `` most of the women and children into safe houses , '' and were trying to get water and blankets for the growing crowd , Weinberg said . Some of the refuge-seekers , identifying themselves as supporters of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change , said militia members supporting President Robert Mugabe 's party destroyed their homes or were hunting them because of their affiliation , according to a journalist at the scene . CNN is not identifying the reporter for security reasons . The journalist said the refuge-seekers , some holding their possessions , sat outside the building Thursday afternoon , waiting to be addressed by a U.S. Embassy official . A few of the people had bandaged wounds , according to the reporter . `` The people I can see right now look very miserable , dejected , confused , '' the reporter said . Watch the refuge-seekers wait outside the embassy '' The MDC has said its members were targeted by supporters of Mugabe during the weeks surrounding March 's presidential election and last week 's runoff . MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff , citing violence , intimidation and allegations of vote-rigging . That left Mugabe as the only runoff candidate , allowing him to claim re-election . Tsvangirai himself fled to South Africa for a short time in March during the campaign season , saying he feared for his safety . He also sought refuge in the Dutch Embassy in Harare on June 22 , shortly after announcing he was withdrawing from the runoff . He returned to his Harare home this week , a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said . Several Western nations denounced the violence and declared Mugabe 's runoff victory illegitimate . Reports of violence have continued after the runoff . On Monday , the MDC claimed that a politician from the party was abducted at gunpoint outside a courthouse in the city of Mutare . The assailants , who the MDC said wore military outfits , took Naison Nemadziva , a lawmaker who recently won a seat in parliament against a member of Mugabe 's party , the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front . The MDC claimed in a press release that the kidnapping was by supporters of ZANU-PF and that police had not been able to find the lawmaker . This week , a resolution from the African Union in Egypt called for negotiations between Tsvangirai and Mugabe , and some European Union officials have called for a coalition government in Zimbabwe with Tsvangirai as its leader . But Tsvangirai this week said the `` conditions prevailing in Zimbabwe ... are not conducive '' to negotiations with Mugabe . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday said Mugabe `` has blood on his hands '' after the violence leading to the runoff and should step down . Mugabe has been Zimbabwe 's only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980 , when it was called Rhodesia .","question":""}

The pictures showed a young man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap . There also appeared to be a large , shadowy form of another person in the back seat of the vehicle , which may have been Carson 's SUV . Police believe Atwater was in the back seat , Curran said .

{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq will not grant an operating license to security firm Blackwater Worldwide , an Interior Ministry official said Thursday . Heavily armed Blackwater guards scan downtown Baghdad , Iraq , from a helicopter in 2003 . Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf said the ministry denied the request mainly because of a September 2007 shooting incident in which security guards employed by Blackwater fired on a crowd and killed 17 Iraqis , according to the government . A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad , who asked not to be named , confirmed the report . `` We have been informed that Blackwater 's ... operating license will not be granted , '' the official said . `` We do n't have specifics about dates . We are working with the government of Iraq and our contractors to address the implications of this decision . '' Blackwater has one of the biggest security contracts in Iraq . The U.S. State Department , which contracted the company to protect American diplomats and other employees , is also `` looking at the implications '' of the decision , said Robert Wood , the department 's acting spokesman . Wood did n't say what specific plans the State Department has to protect its employees , but he told reporters that State will encourage contractors to abide by Iraqi law , as required under the recently approved U.S.-Iraqi security agreement , and will make sure its personnel are protected . `` We 're formulating how to go forward , '' he said . Watch report on Iraq 's refusal to grant license to Blackwater '' Wood refused to say whether two other security companies working in Iraq , Triple Canopy and Dyncorp , would take over security operations , but did say those options were being considered . Earlier this month , five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16 , 2007 , shootings in a Baghdad square . A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter . Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents , but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation . The company does not face any charges . But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life . The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act -LRB- MEJA -RRB- . The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services `` in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . '' A security agreement approved in December 2008 specifies U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in Iraq . Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004 , but the provision was not strictly enforced . Last year , the State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government . Starting January 1 , the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain licenses to operate . CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti installed himself as leader of a new unity government late Thursday , a move that drew condemnation from ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya . Making a late night public announcement , Micheletti said his entire cabinet had resigned to clear the way for a reconciliation cabinet to be named . `` This cabinet is a result of an ample participation of different sectors of civil society as well as the political parties , '' he said . `` Tonight with this new government , we 're answering the call for the unity of all people of Honduras . '' He did not identify any of the new cabinet members . Representatives for Micheletti and Zelaya signed an agreement October 30 to form a reconciliation government that would rule until a new president , to be chosen in a November 29 election , takes office in January . The deal included the possibility of Zelaya 's reinstatement to the presidency , but contained no guarantee . The pact called for the unity government to be named by Thursday . The agreement also stipulated that the nation 's congress , in consultation with the supreme court and other institutions , would vote on whether Zelaya would be returned to power . That vote did not occur Thursday . Zelaya told local media that Micheletti 's actions violated the accord , which he called `` a dead letter . '' The reconciliation government , he said , must be led by the democratically elected president of Honduras . `` How can a person who has not been elected by anyone lead a government ? '' he said . Zelaya was flown out of the country by the country 's military June 28 but secretly returned to Honduras on September 21 , obtaining refuge in the Brazilian Embassy . Micheletti sent Zelaya a letter earlier this week asking him for the names of people the deposed president would like to have in the unity government . Zelaya did not answer the letter . Micheletti said Zelaya 's refusal to answer gave the interim president the right to name all the members of a new government . `` With this agreement , we have made an important step to strengthen our democracy , '' Micheletti said . `` Despite the fact that Mister Zelaya did not send any of his representatives ... we 're still looking for an opportunity for these citizens of Honduras to be integrated in the government of reconciliation . '' The Organization of American States , the United Nations , the European Union and the United States condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated . The United States and others imposed economic sanctions , which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras . Many nations , including the United States , also said they would not recognize the winner of this month 's presidential election if the vote is held under Micheletti 's rule . The United States seemed to shift that position after last week 's accord . Thomas Shannon , assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs , told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol this week that the United States would recognize the winner of this month 's presidential election even if Zelaya is not returned to power beforehand . Shannon played a key role in obtaining last week 's agreement . The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya 's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president . The country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal . Micheletti and his supporters say Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup .","question":""}

{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nonnie Dotson , a nurse in the U.S. Air Force , was decompressing from a hard-fought child support battle when she disappeared hundreds of miles from her home base . U.S. Air Force nurse Nonnie Dotson disappeared on the way to the mall on November 19 , 2006 . Dotson , 33 , was staying with her brother at his home outside Denver , Colorado , when she vanished on November 19 , 2006 . She was supposed to meet friends at the mall for a smoothie . She never showed . The single mother and her 16-month-old daughter , Savannah , lived in San Antonio , Texas , where Dotson worked on a military base as an intensive care nurse . They were staying with Dotson 's brother , Tony , for a few days . Watch why Dotson 's disappearance puzzles investigators \u00c2 '' Dotson had recently emerged from a court battle with Ed Vehle , Savannah 's father . Vehle , who also lived in San Antonio , was ordered by the court to pay $ 10,000 in back child support , as well as $ 900 each month . Dotson won the court order two months before she disappeared . Dotson was just months away from completing her military duty and was trying to decide whether she would move back to her hometown in Colorado or remain in San Antonio . Vehle had declared he had no interest in being a part of their lives . The two met in 2004 and the relationship ended when Dotson became pregnant . Vehle did not want her to have the baby , she told friends at the military base . The friends spoke on condition that their identities would not be made public . Vehle is not a suspect or person of interest in the case , police said . Because things appeared to be going well in Dotson 's life , her sudden disappearance is a mystery to her family and to police . She was hundreds of miles away from home in a safe Denver suburb . She left her brother 's home on Sunday afternoon , and the mall was within walking distance , Tony Dotson said . `` She asked me to look after Savannah for a couple hours and she walked out that door and we never saw her again , '' Tony Dotson added . `` She would never have intentionally left Savannah behind like that . '' Police agree . Since Dotson vanished , there has been no activity on her bank accounts , credit cards or cell phone , police said . Her case is still an open missing persons investigation being handled by the Jefferson County homicide department . `` Unfortunately , we have no real leads as to who is responsible for Dotson 's disappearance , '' said sheriff 's office spokeswoman Jacki Kelley . `` She could be alive and being held against her will . She could have been kidnapped and then murdered . We are not ruling anything out at this time , '' Kelley said . For several weeks after Dotson 's disappearance , Vehle refused to answer questions . He retained counsel . In mid-December 2006 , Vehle and Jay Norton , his attorney , met with police , answering all their questions . Norton said they were able to provide investigators with receipts and cell phone records accounting for Vehle 's whereabouts . Police confirmed that Vehle was nowhere near Colorado before , during or after Dotson 's disappearance . After Dotson 's disappearance , Vehle decided to go to court to pursue full custody of his daughter . Dotson 's parents had been taking care of Savannah . The court last year gave Vehle shared custody with Dotson 's parents .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unrest has spread across the Middle East and North Africa . Here 's a look at what has happened -- and what is happening -- in various countries : ALGERIA Authorities in Algeria said Monday that they would lift a 20-year state of emergency in the `` coming days . '' They acted after anti-government protesters chanting `` change the power ! '' clashed with security forces in the capital over the weekend , witnesses said . The state of emergency was imposed in 1992 to quell a civil war that led to the deaths of what U.S. officials estimate to be more than 150,000 people . About 100 protesters were arrested during the protests in Algiers on Saturday , according to the opposition Algerian League for Human Rights . BAHRAIN Protests were scheduled to take place Monday afternoon in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain , where at least three police officers and one demonstrator were injured in clashes Sunday , the state new agency reported . The injuries occurred during an attack on a police station during protests Sunday evening , the news agency said . After three officers were injured , police fired on protesters with rubber bullets , causing one injury , the news agency said . EGYPT Unrest persisted in Egypt on Monday even after an 18-day revolution toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak , who stepped down Friday . Egypt 's banks remained closed Monday after protests by National Bank workers apparently drove out the head of the institution . The nation 's stock market remained closed until further notice because of turmoil in the banking sector . In addition , current and former police officers continued a peaceful protest Monday in front of the Interior Ministry , saying they want higher pay , shorter hours , better benefits and more respect . And some police officers told reporters they were ordered to shoot protesters during demonstrations last week and threatened with prison if they did not . IRAN Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched along Revolution Avenue in downtown Tehran on Monday , protesting the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , witnesses said . The wave of people remained largely silent as they walked toward the capital city 's Azadi Square , though some clashes between security forces and demonstrators broke out in several parts of Tehran , according to witnesses . Security forces fired tear gas in some places and detained demonstrators in other areas of the city . The Iranian government rounded up activists last week after opposition leaders Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi called for supporters to gather at Azadi Square -- the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . IRAQ Thousands of people rallied this month in cities across the country , protesting rampant poverty , a 45 % national unemployment rate and shortages of food , electricity and water . Most recently , hundreds of angry demonstrators took to the streets of Ramadi -- about 60 miles -LRB- 100 kilometers -RRB- west of Baghdad -- to protest the government 's inability to provide basic services . After the protests began , Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced he would cut his salary in half amid the growing unrest over poor public services and water shortages . State television also reported this month that al-Maliki would not run for a third term when his current one expires in 2014 . JORDAN U.S. Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , traveled over the weekend to Jordan , where King Abdullah II swore in a new government last week following anti-government protests in his country . The new government has a mandate for political reform and is headed by a former general , with several opposition and media figures among its ranks . The appointment of new Prime Minister Marouf al Bakhit was seen as an attempt to shore up support among Jordan 's Bedouin tribes -- the bedrock of the monarchy . Jordan 's economy has been hard-hit by the global economic downturn and rising commodity prices , and youth unemployment is high , as it is in Egypt . Officials close to the palace have told CNN that Abdullah is trying to turn a regional upheaval into an opportunity for reform . LIBYA There were calls made through Facebook for a day of peaceful demonstrations in Libya on Monday . The protests come in the shadow of leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled the country for almost 40 years and had expressed support for former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during the crisis there . It was not immediately clear Monday whether protests had taken place . PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 's Cabinet submitted its resignations to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday , days after the announcement of new elections in September . The Palestinian Territories have not seen the same kind of demonstrations as in many Arab countries , but the government has been under criticism since Al-Jazeera published secret papers claiming to reveal some of the wide-ranging concessions Palestinian officials were prepared to make in negotiations with Israel . Negotiations have collapsed . Abbas ' Palestinian Authority holds sway only over the West Bank . The militant Islamist movement Hamas controls Gaza . SYRIA As protests heated up around the region , the Syrian government pulled back from a plan to withdraw some subsidies that keep the cost of living down in the country . President Bashar al-Assad also gave a rare interview to Western media , telling The Wall Street Journal for a January 31 article that he planned reforms that would allow for local elections and also included a new media law and more power for private organizations . A planned `` Day of Rage '' that was being organized on Facebook for February 5 failed to materialize , The New York Times reported . SUDAN Demonstrators have clashed with authorities on several recent occasions in Sudan . Human Rights Watch has said that `` authorities used excessive force during largely peaceful protests on January 30 and 31 in Khartoum and other northern cities to call for an end to the National Congress Party rule and government-imposed price increases . '' Witnesses said that security forces used pipes , sticks and tear gas to disperse protesters and that several were arrested , including 20 who remain missing . The Sudanese Embassy said that people in Sudan have the right to `` demonstrate as they wish '' but that `` some opportunists capitalize '' on incidents `` to inspire chaos or smear Sudan 's image . '' TUNISIA The European Union 's top foreign policy official , Catherine Ashton , met Monday with government and civil society leaders in Tunisia , the North African country where protests in December sparked unrest that has spread across North Africa and the Middle East . After weeks of demonstrations that started in December , longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country . Since then , Italy has complained about a wave of migrants from Tunisia coming into its territory . YEMEN Clashes broke out between pro- and anti-government protesters in Yemen 's capital , Sanaa , for at least the third day in a row Monday . About 200 anti-government protesters were confronted by about 300 counter-demonstrators , and the two sides threw rocks at each other and brandished daggers and knives . Several protesters were arrested . On Sunday , hundreds of anti-government protesters marched toward the presidential palace , but were blocked by security forces . Protesters attempted to reach the palace on side streets , and riot police reportedly used force in attempting to disperse them . Human rights group Amnesty International condemned the use of force in a statement issued Monday . Clashes also erupted Friday night and Saturday . Yemen 's Embassy in Washington said the opposition coalition had announced its intention to hold a dialogue with the administration . Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years and has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rioting has flared near Belfast on Saturday after the arrests of three men in the killings of two soldiers in Northern Ireland last week , police said . Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs Saturday in Lurgan , Northern Ireland . Petrol bombs have been hurled at police in Lurgan , a town in County Armagh , 20 miles west of Belfast , police in Northern Ireland said . There are gangs of youths on the streets , authorities said , but there have been no arrests or injuries . Police announced the arrests on Saturday and said the three men have been taken to the police service 's Serious Crime Suite in County Antrim . One of them , a dissident republican named Colin Duffy , is from Lurgan . They are the first arrests in connection with the March 7 shootings , which were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years . The two British soldiers were shot dead at a base in Massereene , in Antrim , as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan . The soldiers , Cengiz `` Pat '' Azimkar , 21 , and Mark Quinsey , 23 , had already packed their bags and changed into desert uniforms , authorities said . Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks , authorities said . Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded . The shooting has sparked fears of a return to the sectarian violence that Northern Ireland suffered until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 , a period known as The Troubles . A militant splinter group , the Real IRA , reportedly claimed it had carried out the attack on the soldiers . Two days after the soldiers were killed , a police officer was killed in a shooting southwest of Belfast . Constable Stephen Carroll was one of four officers who were responding to call in Craigavon when his vehicle came under fire and he was killed . Three people have been arrested in connection with the police officer 's death . The Continuity IRA , a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement , said it had killed Carroll , Britain 's Press Association reported . Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings , with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers `` traitors to the island of Ireland . '' Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland . The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army . Danny Kennedy , deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party , which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom , also condemned the attack as `` wicked and murderous .

{"answer":"NASSAU , Bahamas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John Travolta 's lawyer testified Tuesday that the paramedic who drove Travolta 's son to a hospital the day he died later wanted money for documents the driver suggested could be detrimental to the actor . John Travolta 's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16 . Paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial , accused of plotting to extort $ 25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas . Travolta , who testified last Wednesday , is expected to return to the witness stand later in the week . Travolta 's lawyer , Allyson Maynard-Gibson , said Bridgewater approached her in the days after Jett 's death on January 2 , saying she had a client who had a document Travolta might want . Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers , which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability , Maynard-Gibson testified . The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because `` he would not want his name tarnished in media , '' Maynard-Gibson said . Bridgewater told Travolta 's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital , instead of going directly to a local hospital , she said . Maynard-Gibson said she called police , who then videotaped a hotel room meeting between the paramedic and another Travolta lawyer . Those investigators testified Tuesday , and their video was expected to be played in court later . Travolta 's testimony last week was the first time he spoke publicly about his desperate efforts to save his son 's life after he suffered a seizure at the family 's vacation home in the Bahamas . Travolta and his wife , actress Kelly Preston , have been in seclusion for most of this year . Friends have described their deep grief over Jett 's death . Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas , where the family was spending their New Year 's holiday . A family friend with a medical background helped in urgent efforts to revive Jett , Travolta said . `` We continued CPR , and my wife was holding his head , '' Travolta said . His wife sat in the Nassau courtroom , sometimes crying as she listened to the testimony . Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked . Travolta , who is a pilot , said he wanted to fly his son to a West Palm Beach , Florida , hospital instead of driving him to one in Freeport . The paramedic , however , asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability . `` I received a liability of release document , '' he said . `` I signed it . I did not read it . Time was of the essence . '' Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son , they decided to divert to the hospital . At the hospital , Travolta was told his son `` was n't alive , '' he said .","question":""}

Amy Harned , 48 , takes a lot of vitamins and maintains a healthy diet to manage her lupus . The 48-year-old is doing more than protecting herself from dangerous ultraviolet rays . She 's trying to keep the sunlight from triggering a flareup of her lupus . Harned , who lives in Webster , Massachusetts , is among the 1.5 million Americans who suffer from the autoimmune disorder . Lupus causes the body 's immune system to attack its own tissues , causing inflammation and damage . When Harned 's lupus was first diagnosed , she said she `` was really terrified , but gradually I got more information . '' She realized with proper treatment she could lead a somewhat normal life . No two cases are alike , experts say . In fact , there are four types of the illness , ranging from mild to severe . Before effective therapies were developed , the disease was fatal more often , usually from overwhelming infection and kidney failure . Health Minute : Watch more on living with lupus '' The Lupus Foundation of America estimated that more than 16,000 new cases develop every year . More than 90 percent of people with lupus are women , the group says . Experts are n't sure why . `` It clearly has to do with estrogen and estrogen receptors , '' said Lisa Fitzgerald , a Boston , Massachusetts-based rheumatologist . Genetics can play a role as well . Not only does lupus run in families , but , Fitzgerald said , a person may be more susceptible if a relative has other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis . Environmental factors also may increase risk of the disease . Researchers believe that taking certain prescription medications , and even exposure to sunlight , can trigger the illness . Age is another risk factor . The Lupus Foundation says the condition is most often diagnosed when women are in their childbearing years between 15 and 45 . Harned 's symptoms developed 15 years ago , when she was 33 . `` My first symptoms with lupus were -LSB- that -RSB- my hands were swollen , '' Harned recalled . `` They were very stiff , to the point that brushing my teeth was hard just holding the toothbrush . '' The stiffness and achy joint pain are caused by inflammation brought on by lupus , Fitzgerald said . In addition to swollen joints , she said the other symptoms include fatigue , facial rash , fever , chest pain , swollen glands and sores in the mouth and nose . With such varied symptoms , diagnosis can be tricky . The American College of Rheumatology recommends doctors confirm four of 11 criteria for a proper diagnosis . A blood test and urinalysis are two of the ways doctors determine whether a patient has lupus . Researchers have come a long way in the last 50 years when it comes to understanding the condition , Fitzgerald said . `` The prognosis for lupus today is very good , '' she said . `` The survival rate is really over 90 percent in five to 10 years of having the disease . In the 1950s it was probably 50 percent . '' Part of the reason for the improved success has to do with better treatment in managing the condition . Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin , naproxen and ibuprofen offer relief to some patients . Other lupus sufferers might be prescribed an antimalarial drug called hydroxychloroquine . `` It 's a quinine derivative . It 's quite safe , '' Fitzgerald said . `` It can make a big difference for patients who have mild disease . '' Fitzgerald added she also prescribes corticosteroids `` to squelch flareups . '' While they work well , she cautioned they do have side effects . After 15 years of living with the condition , Harned has her own tricks for coping with lupus . In addition to taking daily prescription drugs , Harned controls the symptoms by eating a healthy diet and exercising , getting enough rest and taking what she called `` a ton of vitamins . '' Some experts have touted fish oil and flaxseed as promising complements that may help ease inflammation . Harned also slathers her exposed skin with sunscreen containing SPF 45 . `` There is an aspect of ultraviolet light that can damage DNA in the cells , '' Fitzgerald said . `` This sets off an inflammatory reaction that causes the rash we know as lupus rash . '' While Harned is fully aware there is no cure for lupus , she described herself as someone who is not just managing her illness , but thriving . When she looks toward the future , she said she thinks , `` I had grandparents who lived into their 90s . So that 's what I 'm hoping for , maybe even 100 .

{"answer":"Jackson , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Troy Davis , whose case drew international attention , was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of an off-duty police officer in Savannah , Georgia , prison officials announced Wednesday night . Until the very end , Davis maintained his innocence . After he was strapped to the death gurney , he lifted his head to address the family of the slain officer . He told the family of Mark MacPhail that he was not responsible for the officer 's death and did not have a gun at the time , according to execution witnesses . Davis said the case merited further investigation , talking fast as officials prepared to give him the lethal cocktail . The execution followed the U.S. Supreme Court 's rejection of a stay , allowing the state to proceed . Davis was declared dead at 11:08 p.m. ET . Throughout the day , Davis ' lawyers and high-profile supporters had asked the state and various courts to intervene , arguing he did not murder MacPhail in 1989 . Davis initially had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET . But the proceeding was delayed more than three hours as the justices pondered a plea filed by his attorney . Several hundred people , most of them opposing the proceeding , gathered outside the state prison in Jackson where Davis , 42 , awaited his fate . Others held a vigil in a nearby church . The inmate 's sister , Martina Davis-Correia , was among those who held a vigil outside the prison . Before the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision , she said officials needed to take more time to examine the case . `` When you are looking at someone 's life , you ca n't press rewind , '' she said . More than 100 officers , many in riot gear , stood guard over the largely-quiet gathering , which featured candles , occasional prayers and songs . `` Tonight the state of Georgia legally lynched an innocent man , '' Davis ' lawyer Thomas Ruffin Jr. said . `` Tonight I witnessed something tragic . '' Amnesty International condemned the execution in a statement . `` The U.S. justice system was shaken to its core as Georgia executed a person who may well be innocent . Killing a man under this enormous cloud of doubt is horrific and amounts to a catastrophic failure of the justice system , '' Amnesty said . Anneliese MacPhail , the slain officer 's mother , said she was relieved and that justice was served . Davis ' supporters , who also rallied outside the U.S. Supreme Court building , argued that his conviction was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted , including a jailhouse informer who claimed Davis had confessed . `` There 's a genuine feeling among people here and across the nation that we 're about to do the unthinkable , '' said Isaac Newton Farris Jr. , president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . But prosecutors have stood by the conviction and every appeal -- including the last-minute petitions filed Wednesday -- has failed . Davis ' supporters cheered and hugged each other when news of the earlier delay reached them . Davis ' attorneys started the day by asking a judge in Jackson , where Georgia 's death row is located , to halt the proceeding , citing a new analysis they say shows ballistics testimony at his trial was `` inaccurate and misleading . '' They also note that a federal judge found in 2010 that a jailhouse informer 's testimony that Davis confessed to killing MacPhail was `` patently false '' and that prosecutors knew a key eyewitness account was wrong . `` Clearly , the fact that Mr. Davis ' death sentence rests in part on ` patently false ' and egregiously inaccurate and misleading testimony , evidence and argument renders the death sentence fundamentally unfair , unreliable and therefore violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments , '' his attorneys argued in a motion filed Wednesday morning . That appeal was denied Wednesday afternoon . The state Supreme Court followed suit a short time later , leading his attorneys to turn to the U.S. Supreme Court in the final hour before the execution . Davis has been scheduled to die three times before , most recently in October 2008 . That time , the U.S. Supreme Court halted the execution two hours before it was scheduled to take place . This time , Davis declined to request the special last meal offered inmates prior to execution and was offered a standard meal tray : Grilled cheeseburgers , oven-browned potatoes , baked beans , coleslaw , cookies and a grape drink . `` He has continued to insist this is not his last meal , '' said the Rev. Raphael Warnock , the senior pastor at Atlanta 's Ebenezer Baptist Church . Pope Benedict , South African anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter said the execution should have been called off . Amnesty International and the NAACP led efforts to exonerate Davis , and U.N. human rights officials joined those calls Wednesday . `` Not only do we urgently appeal to the government of the United States and the state of Georgia to find a way to stop the scheduled execution , but we believe that serious consideration should be given to commuting the sentence , '' read a joint statement from the U.N. special rapporteurs on arbitrary executions , judicial independence and torture . But the man who originally prosecuted the case , Spencer Lawton , said those who do not believe there is physical evidence in the case are wrong . `` There are two Troy Davis cases , '' Lawton said Tuesday . `` There is the legal case and the public relations case . We have consistently won in court , and consistently lost in the public relations battle . '' Since Davis ' 1991 trial , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony . The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a district court in Savannah to review his claims of innocence in 2009 , but District Judge William Moore ruled the following year that the evidence did `` not require the reversal of the jury 's judgment . '' The parole board rejected a plea for clemency on Tuesday . In Georgia , only the board -- not the governor -- has the right to grant clemency . And a request that Davis be allowed to sit for a polygraph by his attorneys was also rejected by the state Department of Corrections . Davis ' supporters argue he was the victim of a rush to judgment by police seeking justice for the death of one of their own , as well as widespread racial prejudice in the criminal justice system . Warnock said several other inmates have been proven innocent in recent years . Supporters argued that the original witnesses who testified against Davis were fearful of police and spoke under duress . Other witnesses also have since come forward with accounts that call Davis ' conviction into question , according to his supporters . According to prosecutors , Davis was at a pool party in Savannah when he shot a man , Michael Cooper , wounding him in the face . He then went to a nearby convenience store , where he pistol-whipped a homeless man , Larry Young , who 'd just bought a beer , according to accounts of the case . Prosecutors said MacPhail rushed to the scene to help , but Davis shot him three times . They said Davis shot the officer once in the face as he stood over him . A jury convicted Davis on two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of possessing a firearm during a crime , obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder . The murder charge led to the death sentence . Anneliese MacPhail said earlier this week that she did n't begrudge protesters their opinions . But she said they do n't understand the facts of the case . `` To them the point is the death penalty . Ninety-nine percent have absolutely no idea who Troy Davis is or who Mark MacPhail was , '' she said . `` They 're just following their belief .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Organs donated by a slain Oakland , California , police officer saved four lives , and his donated tissue will enhance the lives of up to 50 others , the California Transplant Donor Network said Wednesday . Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland , California . Officer John Hege , 41 , was pronounced brain dead on Sunday but was kept on life support pending a decision on organ donation . He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents . `` Officer Hege was registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Registry , which his family also supports , '' the donor network said in a news release . `` He chose in death as he did in life to help those in need . His organ donations saved the lives of four adult males from California . '' Hege 's liver , kidneys and heart were donated , the network said , and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday . In a written statement , Hege 's family said , `` Our son John never met a stranger . '' `` John 's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life , '' the family said in the statement . `` In June 2008 , he registered on the Donate Life California Organ and Tissue Donor Registry . We completely and proudly support his decision , and it gives us a great deal of comfort to know that four individuals have received the gift of life because of our selfless and beloved John . `` Even in death he gave to the lives of those in our community whom he had always loved and supported . '' Hege had been with the Oakland police force about 10 years . The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon , 26 , of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding , police said . Authorities said Saturday night that Mixon had an extensive criminal history and was in violation of parole for assault with a deadly weapon . The incidents began about 1 p.m. Saturday in east Oakland , when two motorcycle officers tried to pull over a car for a `` fairly routine traffic stop , '' said Dave Kozicki , deputy police chief . Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help , he said . Those officers were Hege and Sgt. Mark Dunakin , 40 , an 18-year veteran of the force . Dunakin died Saturday . Police launched an intense manhunt to track down the gunman . An anonymous caller directed authorities to a building on an adjacent street where the man was believed to be barricaded , acting Police Chief Howard Jordan said . The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment , hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man , Jordan said . Those two officers -- Sgt. Ervin Romans , 43 , and Sgt. Daniel Sakai , 35 -- died . Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000 . A fifth officer who was grazed by a bullet was treated at a hospital and released , police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday proposed fines against two of the nation 's largest airlines , saying the airlines flew planes on hundreds of occasions in violation of FAA or airline safety standards . US Airways says the problems are in the past . United notes it self-reported its problem . The FAA is seeking a $ 5.4 million fine from US Airways and a $ 3.8 million fine from United Airlines for unrelated violations . Both airlines issued statements Wednesday assuring the public of their commitment to safety . US Airways blamed its problems on the difficulties of merging US Airways and America West maintenance operations in 2007 . United , meanwhile , said it self-reported the incident leading to its proposed fine and has since taken steps to ensure that safety standards are met . The US Airways case involved the greatest number of planes -- eight . The FAA alleges US Airways operated the eight aircraft on a total of 1,647 flights last fall and winter while the planes were in a potentially unsafe condition . Three of the planes were flown while not in compliance with FAA rules known as Airworthiness Directives , or ADs . The FAA issues ADs when it discovers a potentially unsafe condition on a type of aircraft , and it wants airlines to inspect their fleets or conduct preventive maintenance . The FAA said it issued an AD requiring airlines to inspect Airbus A320 aircraft for possible cracking of a landing gear part . But US Airways operated two Airbus A320s on a total of 43 flights without complying with the ordered inspection . The airline also operated an Embraer 190 aircraft on 19 flights without performing an inspection to prevent a cargo door from opening during flight , according to the FAA . The remaining five cases involve the airline 's failure to follow its own maintenance procedures , the FAA said . In a letter to its employees , US Airways Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom called the FAA announcement disappointing . `` It is important to remember that today 's announcement references situations that are in the past , and in several cases , date back to two years ago , '' he wrote . `` Our team has worked cooperatively with the FAA to investigate and correct any discrepancies to the FAA 's satisfaction . '' The United Airlines case involves one aircraft , a Boeing 737 . According to the FAA and the airline , a pilot noticed a low fuel pressure indication while on a flight from Denver , Colorado , on April 28 , 2008 . The pilot shut down an engine and returned to the Denver airport . United mechanics who inspected the engine found that two shop towels had been used to cover openings in the oil sump area , instead of protective caps . The FAA said the aircraft had flown more than 200 times in the unsafe condition before the problem was discovered . A United spokeswoman said the airline reported the incident to the FAA and has taken several measures to prevent a recurrence , including additional training of maintenance workers . Both airlines have 30 days to respond to the FAA 's proposal for fines . In March , Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to settle a complaint that it flew unsafe planes .","question":""}
{"answer":"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal investigators trying to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet landed on a taxiway instead of the runway in Atlanta on Monday morning say the runway was illuminated , but that approach lights and a ground-based instrument that helps pilots line up with the runway were off . The pilots of the plane that landed at the Atlanta airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes . The incident happened at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport , the world 's busiest . But it occurred shortly before dawn , when airport operations are slow . Delta Flight 60 , from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , was cleared to land on a main runway around 6:05 a.m. , but it landed instead on nearby Taxiway M , which runs parallel to the runway , said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen . The departure taxiway , which can be filled with aircraft during peak hours , was empty at the time , and the plane landed safely , officials said . No one was injured , and there was no damage to the taxiway . The Boeing 767 aircraft had 182 passengers and a crew of 11 . The FAA , the National Transportation Safety Board and Delta Air Lines are investigating . The pilots of the aircraft were placed on nonflight status , Delta said . The NTSB on Wednesday confirmed that a `` check pilot '' on the flight was sick , and the crew had declared a medical emergency . It was not clear what , if any , role that played in the mishap . Sources familiar with the incident say that Flight 60 originally was scheduled to land on Runway 27L -LRB- left -RRB- , the active runway at that time , but was `` sidestepped '' to Runway 27R -LRB- right -RRB- . Pilots commonly ask to be `` sidestepped '' to Runway 27R -- and air traffic controllers commonly offer 27R -- because it is closer to the terminal and pilots can shave minutes from a trip . In this case , it is not clear whether the pilot made the request , or the air traffic controllers made the offer . Nor is it clear why the change was made -- whether to shave time from the flight , or because of the medical emergency on the aircraft or some other reason . But after being given permission to land on Runway 27R , the plane went too far to the right , landing on Taxiway M . The runway was marked with yellow lights , while the taxiway was marked with blue lights , one person familiar with the incident said . The NTSB said the runway lights on 27R were illuminated , but a `` localizer '' and approach lights for the runway were off . Officials said the weather at the airport was clear , and the NTSB said the wind was calm at 10 mph . The sky was dark , with twilight still more than an hour away . The NTSB said a `` check airman '' was in the cockpit with the captain and first officer during the flight , but became ill and moved to the cabin for the remainder of the flight . Check airman are company pilots who watch over crew members during significant flights , such as when a first officer becomes a captain , when a pilot is making a maiden international flight , or over mountainous terrain for the first time . The NTSB said it is uncertain why the check airman was on the Delta flight . Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the NTSB and conducting its own investigation . The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying , he said . The incident came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent this year . Close calls in 2007 at some of the busiest U.S. airports prompted the FAA to take action to reduce the risk of runway incursions and wrong runway departures . There were 24 serious runway incursions that year , eight of them involving commercial carriers .","question":""}
{"answer":"State College , Pennsylvania -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Penn State students and alumni held a candlelight vigil late Sunday to honor and remember Joe Paterno , the iconic former football coach . Paterno , 85 , died Sunday at a State College , Pennsylvania , hospital , according to his family . He had been suffering from lung cancer and had recently broken his pelvis . `` It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today , '' said the statement . `` His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled . '' Students braved freezing temperatures to attend the vigil on the lawn of the Old Main building on Penn State 's campus . They held candles , locked arms , and sung the school 's alma mater to say goodbye . Later , they walked over to a statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium , which has become a sort of makeshift memorial . `` He 's more than a coach ; his family 's more than a family , '' said Bethanna Edmiston , a local resident and alumna who met her husband at Penn State . `` It 's extremely difficult for the whole Nittany nation , '' she said . `` Unless you 're part of Penn State , you just do n't understand what it means . '' Share your thoughts on Paterno 's death Earlier on Sunday , many fans were seen crying as they stood at the statue . It features Paterno with his index finger outstretched in the `` No. 1 '' gesture . A quote from Paterno , who spent 61 years at Penn State , is on the wall behind the statue . `` They ask me what I 'd like written about me when I 'm gone , '' the quote says . `` I hope they write I made Penn State a better place , not just that I was a good football coach . '' Edmiston said she moved to State College at age 8 , as Paterno took the reins at Penn State . `` Our family thanks Penn Staters , students & all people for prayers & support for my Dad , '' Paterno 's son , Jay Paterno , tweeted Sunday , `` He felt your support in his fight . '' Family statement : `` He fought hard until the end '' The gathering at the statue has been ongoing since Saturday night , after a family spokesman said Paterno 's condition had worsened . Some shoveled snow so others could walk up and touch Paterno 's outstretched hand on his statue . Signs , flowers and candles surrounded the statue , along with photographs of Paterno . `` You 're our hero , '' one said . Another one , flanked by candles , simply said : `` Coach . '' Jay Paterno tweeted Saturday night that he drove by the statue , and that the love and support inspired his father . `` He died as he lived , '' the family statement said . `` He fought hard until the end , stayed positive , thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been . '' Media falsely report Paterno 's death Several websites that reported Saturday night that Paterno had died later apologized for the error , including the Penn State student news website Onward State , the first to report the erroneous information . Paterno was fired in November amid outrage over the handling of accusations against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky , who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994 . Sandusky has pleaded not guilty . But several of those gathered at the statue Sunday remembered Paterno as a unifying presence both at the university and in State College . `` I want everyone in our whole country to know that Joe united us , '' said Diane Farley , a Penn State alumna and current university employee . `` And I do n't want anyone to point fingers at anyone anymore , and I want them to know that State College is a place that cares , because Joe cared , and there 's just been a lot of confusion in the past six weeks ... We 're all on this Earth together . We 're all going to go out eventually , like Joe , and we need to be a little bit more loving and caring with each other . '' `` They 're just ordinary people , '' Edmiston said of the Paterno family . `` They lived in the same house since they moved there , not a fancy house , just everyday people . They gave everything they had to Penn State -- not only money , but their time , their efforts . It 's just an amazing legacy that he 's left behind . '' Another man said he does n't believe the scandal will tarnish Paterno 's memory . `` It wo n't define him , '' said the man , who did not give his name . `` It was n't who he was . '' The family previously said Paterno had a treatable form of cancer . In December , he was admitted to a hospital after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home in State College . Under Paterno 's 46-year leadership , the Nittany Lions won two national championships , went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times , according to his official Penn State biography . Sports Illustrated : Paterno 's legacy was more than the final chapter At the time of Paterno 's dismissal , Vice Chairman of Trustees John P. Surma said he hoped the school 's 95,000 students and hundreds of thousands of alumni would believe the decision `` is in the best long-term interest of the university , which is much larger than athletic programs . '' Paterno told the Washington Post this month he felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse against Sandusky . `` I did n't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was , '' Paterno told the Post . `` So I backed away and turned it over to some other people , people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did . It did n't work out that way . '' The former coach spoke with a raspy voice during the interview -- Paterno 's first extensive comments since being fired . A Penn State graduate assistant , Mike McQueary , told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky `` with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line . '' He said he had gone to Paterno with what he saw . Paterno said he 'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report , but that he nevertheless reported the allegations to his boss , then-Athletic Director Tim Curley . Curley and Gary Schultz , a former university vice president , have been charged with perjury and failure to report the abuse allegations , which law enforcement did not learn about for several years . They have pleaded not guilty . `` You know , he did n't want to get specific , '' Paterno said about McQueary . `` And to be frank with you I do n't know that it would have done any good , because I never heard of , of , rape and a man . So I just did what I thought was best . I talked to people that I thought would be , if there was a problem , that would be following up on it , '' he told The Washington Post . `` I called my superiors and I said , ` Hey , we got a problem , I think . Would you guys look into it ? ' Because I did n't know , you know ... I had never had to deal with something like that . And I did n't feel adequate , '' Paterno said . `` Joe was Penn State , '' Edmiston said . `` He made Penn State . And it 's really a very sad , sad day for all of us .

{"answer":"Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into Wednesday night , despite violent crackdowns and arrests . Witnesses in Tehran tell CNN the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands . The protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy . Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday , and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-American speeches in front of the building that once housed the U.S. diplomatic corps . Many chanted `` Death to America . '' The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June , following a disputed presidential election . Thousands of protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home , many chanting `` Death to the Dictator '' and others saying , `` Obama - Either you 're with us or with them , '' referring to the U.S. president . Riot police and pro-government Basij militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests . `` We were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets , '' said Soheil , an opposition protester , who gave only one name for security reasons . `` Strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away . I ran into a garage for about 15 minutes . When I went back into the main street , I saw riot police arresting a group of young men , then putting them inside a bank and locking the door . `` Only God knows what will happen to them after that . '' iReport : Iranians take to the streets Soheil , like many other of the demonstrators , took part in the protests this summer . As with previous demonstrations , many images of Wednesday 's protest were uploaded to the Internet on the site YouTube.com -- including video of protesters walking over an image of Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Another clip showed a group of women being beaten by what appeared to be Iranian security forces . Witnesses said many Iranian women took part in Wednesday 's demonstration , and were frequently targeted by the Iranian security forces -- which is what also happened during the summer protests . Video posted on YouTube showed many protesters beaten on the head with batons . Iranian reformists have chosen key anniversaries to protest the hardline government -- the same anniversaries chosen for government-sanctioned anti-American rallies . Wednesday 's was the biggest annual anti-American observance of all . On November 4 , 1979 , Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy . They held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days . There were also small pockets of protest on Wednesday in the southwest Iran city of Shiraz , according to a resident who witnessed the protests . Demonstrators marched down the main street of Shiraz , yelling `` Death to the dictator '' and `` We will not stand down to you , together we are united , '' according to Najmeh , who only gave her first name for security reasons . There was strong police presence on the streets , and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions , she said . Earlier in the day , opposition supporters marched defiantly in Tehran 's Haft-e-Tir Square , witnesses said . Many held up their hands in V-signs . Others shouted `` Allahu Akbar , '' or `` God is great , '' which has become a slogan of protest . Police blocked all roads leading to the square , creating massive traffic jams . Witnesses described helmet-clad security personnel beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas at Haft-e-Tir Square and in a neighborhood a few kilometers north . `` I had never seen that many riot police and security personnel , '' a witness told CNN . `` They were brought in by the busloads . As soon as crowds gathered somewhere , riot police were there within minutes . '' The opposition showed Wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown , people were still willing to take risks . The disputed June 12 presidential election triggered Iran 's most serious political crisis since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah . Led by opposition candidate Mir Houssein Moussavi , thousands of Iranians protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office for a second term . In the election aftermath , the Iranian government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public . But despite warnings from the government , Iran 's reformists have largely refused to back down . They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government 's official number . Both Moussavi and Karrubi were prevented from attending Wednesday 's rallies , according to a reformist Web site , Norooz News . Karrubi 's son told the Web site that his father tried to reach the Haft-e-Tir Square rally on foot , but he was blocked by anti-riot police , sparking clashes with his followers . Police fired tear gas toward Karrubi , hitting one of his guards on the head , and causing Karrubi and some of his supporters to fall to the ground , according to Norooz News . Karrubi and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when , at one point , security forces attacked and damaged Karrubi 's vehicle , the Web site said . Video posted on YouTube showed Karrubi briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters , who chanted , `` Honorable Karrubi , help the people of Iran . '' Iranian authorities had warned Karrubi to not participate in the marches , saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack , according to Norooz News . Moussavi was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office , according to his Facebook page and a report on a reformist Web site . Cell phone and Internet connections were cut in the area where his office is located , and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against Moussavi , the Web sites said . Read analysis from Hamid Dabashi , author of `` Iran : A People Interrupted '' In Washington , President Obama said the world continues to bear witness to the Iranian people 's `` calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights . '' `` Iran must choose , '' he said in a statement late Tuesday . `` We have heard for thirty years what the Iranian government is against ; the question , now , is what kind of future it is for . `` It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past , or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity , prosperity , and justice for its people , '' he said . Obama noted how the embassy takeover reshaped U.S.-Iranian relations . `` This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion , mistrust , and confrontation , '' he said . `` I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past , and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect . '' Obama said America has demonstrated willingness to work with Iran over nuclear issues by recognizing its right to peaceful nuclear power and accepting a recent proposal by the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency . `` We have made clear that if Iran lives up to the obligations that every nation has , it will have a path to a more prosperous and productive relationship with the international community , '' Obama said .

Friday 's closure of California-based IndyMac bank by federal regulators on Friday sparked investor panic that sent shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a wild ride and fueled speculation of a government rescue . On Sunday , the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps to make funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if necessary . IndyMac , which reopened Monday under federal supervision , was once one of the nation 's largest home lenders . Thanks in part to the nation 's mortgage crisis , it lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year and last , and concerns about the bank led customers to withdraw $ 1.3 billion in the last two weeks , prompting the government takeover . Below , CNN 's Ali Velshi and Gerri Willis answer questions about Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and IndyMac and how you may be affected . Q : What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and what do they do ? A : Originally chartered by Congress , both were converted into private companies with shares traded on Wall Street . Neither company directly loans money to prospective home buyers . Instead , they buy mortgages from banks and other lenders on the secondary market , thus freeing up more funds to home lenders . They resell bundled loans as mortgage-backed securities . Read more about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac '' Combined , the two companies own or guarantee almost half of the home loans in the United States , or $ 5.3 trillion of mortgage debt . Q : How did they get their names ? A : Fannie Mae was created in 1938 , during the Great Depression . The nickname comes from the acronym FNMA , which stands for Federal National Mortgage Association . Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private corporation in 1970 to end Fannie Mae 's monopoly over the secondary mortgage market . The name Freddie Mac spawns from the acronym FHLMC , or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. . Q : What 's the connection between the IndyMac takeover and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ? A : Nothing , except both crises stem from the same problem : a drop in home prices and the inability of mortgage-holders to make their payments , thereby leaving banks -LRB- whether it was IndyMac , an actual lender , or Fannie\/Freddie , the secondary banks that had bought mortgages -RRB- holding the bag . Q : Will the government 's actions change the value of my home ? A : Steps the federal government is taking to shore up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is ultimately a positive for the housing industry . Although it wo n't happen overnight , housing prices could be stabilized by the move . The reason ? These two institutions are critical to the smooth functioning of the mortgage underwriting industry . Q : Is my money safe in the bank ? A : Up to certain limits , money is safe in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. . The FDIC guarantees traditional bank accounts up to $ 100,000 and individual retirement accounts up to $ 250,000 . Money beyond those limits is n't guaranteed if a bank fails . In the case of IndyMac , the FDIC says it will cover 50 percent of uninsured balances there . But as a practical matter , consumers should n't count on that . Bottom line : Owning accounts with amounts that exceed the FDIC limits is like driving without a seat belt . Watch : Is your bank safe ? '' Q : How are the government 's moves to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac going to affect mortgages , loans and the federal budget deficit ? A : Shoring up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is good news for consumer lending lending generally because it boosts confidence in the mortgage markets . If you already have a loan , it 's wo n't have immediate consequences . We do n't yet know if it will be successful and how much the two entities might take advantage of the federal governments offer to lend them money . For that reason , it 's difficult to say what the impact might be on the federal budget deficit . Suffice it to say , however , that the buck always seems to stop with the American taxpayer .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leader of this week 's coup in Guinea assured senior officials Thursday `` they are safe , '' a journalist with the state-run newspaper told CNN . Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara with Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare . Coup leader Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara met with Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare and about 30 other top officials at a military camp in Conakry , the nation 's capital , said Ousmane Barry , a correspondent for the state-run Horoya newspaper . Camara has declared himself president of the National Council for Democracy , which he called a transitional body that will oversee the country 's return to democracy . In effect , that makes Camara president of Guinea , which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte . Souare called Camara `` Mr. President '' at Thursday 's meeting , which was witnessed by journalists , Barry said . The two men also discussed Conte 's funeral , scheduled for Friday . Camara has suspended the government , constitution , political parties and trade unions and formed his own government , Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN on Wednesday . The newly formed government , made up of 26 military personnel and six civilians , is negotiating a power-sharing deal that would reflect its ethnic make-up , Diallo said . International institutions , including the African Union , have condemned the coup . `` What we want to see is the transition to a more democratic governing structure for the people of Guinea , '' U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said earlier this week . Guinea , in western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean , has had only two presidents since gaining independence from France in 1958 . Conte came to power in 1984 , when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president , Sekou Toure . The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993 , when Conte was elected president . He was re-elected in 1998 and 2003 amid allegations of electoral irregularities . Worsening economic conditions and dissatisfaction with corruption and bad governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006 , the CIA World Factbook says . A third nationwide strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests that resulted in two weeks of martial law . To appease the unions and end the unrest , the Factbook says , Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007 .","question":""}
{"answer":"Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko refuses to concede defeat in Ukraine 's presidential election and plans to demand a recount in some districts , officials from her party , Bloc Tymoshenko , said Tuesday . Meanwhile , her rival , former Ukrainian prime minister Victor Yanukovich told CNN it is time for her to give up . Yanukovich is leading Sunday 's runoff election . With 99.98 percent of the votes counted , he has 48.96 percent , while Tymoshenko has 45.47 percent , according to the country 's Central Election Commission . Yanukovich 's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until the vote count was final and their candidate named the winner , Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported . In an exclusive interview with CNN Tuesday , Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power . `` This country has been democratic for five years , and that 's been proven again by this election , '' he said . `` Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution '' by failing to acknowledge defeat . A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising . Ukrainian voter Nikolay Gluhovskiy said he supported Yanukovich because Tymoshenko had been a disappointment . `` All the time Yulia Tymoshenko has been in power , we had no prospects , '' he said at a Yanukovich rally Monday . `` Of course , she is a fighter , but in a bad sense . She should n't have promised us so much and done nothing . '' Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday , the Kremlin told CNN . `` Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign , which was highly rated by international observers , and the success achieved at the presidential election , '' the Kremlin 's statement press statement said . The Kremlin statement did not offer congratulations for a Yanukovich win , however . During the 2004 presidential election , then-Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first world leader to congratulate Yanukovich on his victory , a full two days before the electoral commission declared him the winner . Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night , Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down . But Tymoshenko has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts where , she says , voting irregularities took place , officials from her party said Tuesday . The two politicians have fought a bitter battle . Yanukovich has strong links to Russia , and a checkered election history . In 2004 , he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot 's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race . `` The country remembers times when there were presidents announced , they received congratulations , and then things changed , '' Tymoshenko said Sunday , referring to the 2004 race . A pro-Western uprising , known as the Orange Revolution , followed . Yanukovich 's win was annulled , and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote . Yushchenko ran for a second term this year , but , blamed for Ukraine 's faltering economy , he did not make the runoff . This year 's elections , by contrast to those in 2004 , got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which sent observers . The OSCE hailed the process as `` professional , transparent and honest , '' saying it should `` serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. President Barack Obama called Pakistan 's president Sunday to express condolences over the airstrike that killed 24 soldiers near the Afghanistan border more than a week ago , the White House said in a statement . `` The president made clear that this regrettable incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan and reiterated the United States ' strong commitment to a full investigation , '' the statement said . `` The two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship , which is critical to the security of both nations , and they agreed to stay in close touch . '' The conversation between Obama and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was the latest bid to address strained relations between the two nations after a NATO airstrike killed the Pakistani troops on November 26 . After the attack , Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told CNN that Pakistan was re-evaluating its relationship with the United States . NATO later called the subsequent mass casualties caused by the strike `` tragic -LRB- and -RRB- unintended . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have called the incident a `` tragedy '' and offered condolences , though Washington has not issued a formal apology . The issue of U.S. and fellow NATO forces coming into Pakistan has been an especially sensitive topic in that country since May , when U.S. commandos killed then al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders ' consent During an exclusive interview last week with CNN , Gilani said the country wants to maintain its relationship with the United States as long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty . Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect , the prime minister said : `` At the moment -LRB- it is -RRB- not . '' `` If I ca n't protect the sovereignty of my country , how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest ? '' he asked rhetorically . Pakistan has taken several steps aimed at NATO since the attack . That includes an announcement Friday , by Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar , that NATO and International Security Assistance Force supplies could no longer be routed through Pakistan . The country has served a vital supply route for allied forces who have been fighting for more than a decade in neighboring Afghanistan .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man on trial for gunning down a Kansas abortion provider in church said he had no regrets because `` abortion is murder . '' Scott Roeder , 51 , said he shot and killed Dr. George Tiller as services began on May 31 to save the lives of the unborn . `` There was nothing being done and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , '' Roeder said . `` I did what I thought was needed to be done to protect the children . '' Roeder is charged with one count of first-degree murder for the death of Tiller , who ran a women 's clinic in Wichita where abortions were performed , including the controversial late-term procedure . Roeder was the only witness for the defense , which rested its case Thursday . Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert told jurors closing arguments will be held Friday morning , depending on the weather . After the jury left , Wilbert ruled that the jury could not consider convicting Roeder of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter , which is defined as `` an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force '' under Kansas statute . Wilbert said testimony did not support the defense claim that Roeder 's beliefs on abortion justified the use of deadly force against Tiller . Tiller , 67 , was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions . He had already survived one attempt on his life and a clinic bombing before he was slain . During Roeder 's testimony Thursday , Tiller 's widow , Jeanne , and other family members sat in the gallery . Initially stoic , they began to dab at tears as Roeder described putting a gun to Tiller 's head . Asked if he regretted what he did , Roeder said , `` No , I do n't . '' Upon learning that Tiller 's clinic was shut down after his death , he said he felt `` a sense of relief . '' Dressed in a dark suit , white shirt and a red patterned tie , Roeder calmly testified that he had a long-standing belief that Tiller should die . He thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into him , perhaps , or shooting him with a rifle . His main concern , Roeder said , was that he might harm others . Under cross-examination by Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston , he said he also considered cutting Tiller 's hands off with a sword , but decided that would not be effective , as Tiller would still be able to train others . Roeder said that through the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue he learned that Tiller took measures to protect himself -- traveling in an armored car , using a security escort , wearing a bulletproof vest and living in a gated community . He decided to kill Tiller at his church , he said , because `` I felt that actually if he was to be stopped , that was probably the only place he could have been stopped . ... It was the only window of opportunity I saw . '' Roeder said he visited the church four or five times before Tiller 's death . The week before the shooting , on May 24 , he carried a .22 - caliber handgun with him , he testified , but Tiller did not attend church that day . On May 31 , though , the doctor was greeting congregants in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church before Roeder walked up to him and shot him at point blank range . `` The lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop George Tiller , '' Roeder said . `` I shot him . '' Under questioning from Foulston , Roeder acknowledged that he `` somewhat '' admired those who previously had committed violence against abortion providers . He said his anti-abortion beliefs `` go hand in hand '' with his religious beliefs . He said he became born again in 1992 after watching an episode of `` The 700 Club . '' Asked if there are any circumstances in which he believes abortion is acceptable , Roeder said he thought it could be if the mother 's life was in `` absolute '' danger . `` I struggle with that decision , '' he said , `` because I believe that ultimately , it is up to our heavenly father . But if there was a time , that would be it . '' He said he did not believe abortion was justified in the case of rape . `` You are taking the life of the innocent . You 're punishing the innocent life for the sin of the father . Two wrongs do n't make a right . '' Asked about incest , he said his beliefs were the same : `` It is n't our duty to take life , it 's our heavenly father 's . '' Roeder 's testimony was peppered with objections from prosecutors . Many objections were sustained by Wilbert , who has maintained he does not want the trial to become a forum on abortion . In a conference out of the presence of jurors , Wilbert cautioned Roeder , saying specifics on medical procedures would not be allowed . Roeder 's testimony would proceed , Wilbert said , `` on a question-by-question basis . '' Roeder recounted conducting what he called `` sidewalk counseling '' at Kansas City abortion clinics , handing pamphlets and other literature to women as they went inside . `` Some of them did ultimately change their mind , '' he said . In opening statements Thursday , defense attorney Steve Osburn told jurors Roeder `` killed Dr. Tiller because he believed that was the only way , necessary to save the lives of the unborn . '' Defense attorneys claim Roeder was also motivated by authorities ' failure to punish him through the judicial system . Wilbert refused to allow former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline to testify on behalf of the defense . On Wednesday , he refused to allow testimony from current Deputy Attorney General Barry Disney . Kline unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute Tiller in 2006 . Disney charged Tiller with 19 misdemeanor counts , but a jury acquitted the doctor . Wilbert said Roeder can testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs , but to allow testimony from Kline would `` get into legal matters that do not concern this jury . '' And , the judge said , the cases do not give Roeder a basis to state absolutely that Tiller 's actions were illegal , since the doctor had never been convicted . Roeder testified he was `` very frustrated '' by Tiller 's acquittal , saying it `` seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of Kansas to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in George Tiller 's clinic . '' Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue , told reporters outside the courtroom the trial is `` a railroad , a kangaroo court , where they are denying critical evidence about what was on Scott Roeder 's mind when he pulled the trigger . '' `` Perhaps if the Sedgwick County prosecutors had done a better job prosecuting Tiller for how he illegally killed babies , he would still be alive , '' Terry said .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Congress voted to halt planned cuts in Medicare payments to doctors Tuesday , overriding President Bush 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians . President Bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices `` away from seniors to pay physicians . '' The new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect July 1 . The money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized Medicare Advantage program , which the Bush administration strongly supports . Bush spiked the bill Tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be `` taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians . '' `` I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , '' he said in his veto message . The Senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over Bush 's objections , the third time in his presidency that Congress has overridden his veto . The margin in the House of Representatives was a lopsided 383-41 , well beyond the two-thirds majority needed . The American Medical Association lobbied heavily for the bill , warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing Medicare patients if the cuts went into effect . But insurers , which receive government subsidies to offer Medicare Advantage plans , warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed . A total of 21 Senate Republicans joined 47 Democrats and two independents in the override vote . Supporters broke a GOP-led filibuster of the bill last week , aided by the dramatic return of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts . Kennedy 's vote came in his first appearance on the Senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early June . Though he did not vote Tuesday , Kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the `` misguided '' veto . `` It 's a great vote , and a great day for America 's seniors , '' he said in a written statement . Those Republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to Medicare in 2003 , when Congress created privately run , government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage . `` These are not pro-patient policies , '' said Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Arizona . `` Rather , the bill reduces access , benefits and choices for Medicare beneficiaries . '' But critics of the 2003 reforms say Medicare Advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular Medicare , the federal health insurance program for seniors . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $ 12.5 billion by 2013 , largely by reducing Medicare Advantage enrollment . Sen. Patty Murray , D-Washington , said the bill also made `` vital improvements '' by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care . `` Today , we can stand up for Medicare , '' she said . `` We did it last week , when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin , and I believe we can do it today by overriding that veto . '' Congress had passed only two bills over Bush 's objections : a $ 23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $ 300 billion farm bill he spiked in May . The Medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly Americans . Rising health care costs have made Medicare a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age . While the debate was raging over the bill , the AMA said the cuts could lead to a `` meltdown '' of the government 's health care system for the elderly . A recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect . `` We stand at the brink of a Medicare meltdown . ... For doctors , this is not a partisan issue ; it 's a patient access issue , '' AMA President Nancy Nielsen said in a statement after last week 's Senate vote . The AMA ran radio and TV ads over the July Fourth congressional recess targeting 10 Republican senators , seven of whom are up for re-election . The AARP , the nation 's largest organization of retired people , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts . Gerald Harmon , a family physician who practices in Pawleys Island , South Carolina , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer Medicare patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need . `` This Medicare access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , '' said Harmon , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for Medicare . `` It affects your dad when he 's sick . It affects my patients in my practice . This has to be addressed . '' CNN 's Elaine Quijano and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- -- It was a glass half-full , glass half-empty kind of weekend at the box office for `` Funny People , '' writer-director Judd Apatow 's comedic meditation on fame , humor , life , and death . Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in `` Funny People , '' which took the No. 1 slot at the box office this weekend . According to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office , it opened at the top spot with an estimated $ 23.4 million , better than Apatow 's The 40 Year-Old Virgin -LRB- $ 21.4 million -RRB- -- hence , the glass is half full . But that figure is far lower than the debut for Apatow 's `` Knocked Up '' -LRB- $ 30.7 million -RRB- , and it 's the worst opening for a comedy for star Adam Sander since his 2000 turkey `` Little Nicky '' -- hence , the glass is half empty . Of course , `` Funny People '' was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest , and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler 's serious efforts `` Reign Over Me , '' `` Spanglish , '' and `` Punch-Drunk Love , '' Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again . But whether it 's a comedy , drama , or dramedy , `` Funny People 's '' $ 75 million budget is quite the handful of pretty pennies , and with a shaky `` B - '' Cinemascore , the film is going to have a hard time overcoming tepid word-of-mouth -- and we 're back to the half-empty glass . So let 's just move on , shall we ? The cup of a certain adolescent wizard , meanwhile , definitely runneth over .

Of the two other wide releases this weekend , at least the sci-fi family comedy `` Aliens in the Attic '' -- which grossed a meager $ 7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10 . The torture porn flick `` The Collector '' collected a grisly $ 3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place . Box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year , when The `` Dark Knight '' and `` The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor '' both took in over $ 40 million , but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama on Saturday urged a thorough investigation into a deadly explosion at a West Virginia coal mine that killed 29 people , hours after rescue efforts at the mine gave way to an operation to recover the dead . `` This has been America 's worst mining disaster in forty years , and the toll on all West Virginians has been immeasurable , '' Obama said of Monday 's blast at the Upper Big Branch mine . `` We can not bring back the men we lost . What we can do , in their memory , is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability . '' Obama 's statement came just hours after rescue efforts came to a grim end after crews found the bodies of the last four miners unaccounted for in the explosion . Twenty-five people were previously announced dead . `` My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who were lost in this tragic accident , and my gratitude goes out to the rescue teams who worked so tirelessly and heroically to search for the missing , '' Obama said in his statement . The death toll makes the West Virginia mining disaster the worst in the U.S. since 1972 , when 91 miners were killed in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg , Idaho . Of the 29 dead in the West Virginia blast , the bodies of 22 remain inside the mine . The cause of the blast is unknown , and state and federal officials have pledged a full investigation . The explosion has prompted renewed questions about mine safety . Obama said Saturday that `` all Americans deserve to work in a place that is safe , and we must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all our miners are as safe as possible so that a disaster like this does n't happen again . '' Obama will meet next week with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and a Mine Safety and Health Administration official to hear their initial assessment of what caused the blast , along with their recommendations for steps the federal government should take to improve mine safety . Richmond , Virginia-based Massey Energy Co. , which owns the mine , said in a statement released Friday that it will conduct `` extensive '' reviews of the mine accident `` to ensure that a similar incident does n't happen again . '' It said the mine has had less than one violation per day in inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and added that that rate is `` consistent with national averages . '' Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long wall cutting was taking place . The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas , both of which are explosive . West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin said Saturday that even though it 's not clear what caused the explosion , there needs to be a focus on better ventilation and on sensors to alert mine personnel when gas levels become dangerous . `` There was no way to protect them against this , '' he said . `` You just have to prevent it and make sure it does n't happen again .

The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend . Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it , even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $ 2,000 at best . But , aware of the program that started this month , Sable took a $ 4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new , more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser . And Chrysler , eager to sell vehicles , threw in its own $ 4,500 incentive . The $ 9,000 in savings knocked the price to $ 8,900 before taxes and fees . `` I 'll never get $ 9,000 for this old vehicle -LSB- any other way -RSB- . I 'd have been foolish not to take it , '' the 43-year-old Sable , an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore , New York , told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com . He 'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan . iReport.com : Read Sable 's account of the purchase Under the $ 1 billion program , people will be given credits of $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city\/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient . The old vehicles are crushed or shredded . Watch CNN 's Gerri Willis explain the `` cash for clunkers '' program '' The exact credit offered through the program -- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 , or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets . Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type . New cars must have a combined city\/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg . New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg . New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg . The government put Sable 's old Jeep at 15 mpg . His new PT Cruiser , which the program classifies as an SUV , gets a combined 21 mpg . Part of the program 's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road . Caroline Radtke , a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com , was happy to oblige . Radtke and her husband this month got a $ 4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper -LRB- 15 mpg -RRB- to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen , a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg . After the credit , they paid just under $ 26,000 . `` What was going out of my -LSB- old -RSB- vehicle was bad for the planet , and you 're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast , '' Radtke , a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio , Texas , told CNN after filing her iReport . `` After driving it for eight and a half years , I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth . '' The couple would have bought a new car without CARS , but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have , Radtke said . If they had sold the Trooper themselves , they might have gotten $ 3,000 if they were lucky , she said . iReport.com : Radtke 's purchase The CARS program is n't for everyone . The credit wo n't go toward used-car purchases . Also , people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it . But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan , a Salt Lake City , Utah , woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck , which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg . She and her husband already had a newer vehicle , but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes . But lately it started having shifting problems , and it was occasionally slipping going uphill . Like Sable , Callahan , 39 , got $ 4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser . And , like Sable , she also received a separate $ 4,500 credit from Chrysler . She 'll be paying about $ 10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees . The $ 9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler is n't too shabby , considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles . iReport.com : How Callahan got $ 9,000 for her truck `` Without the incentives , I probably would n't have purchased a brand new vehicle , '' Callahan , who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah , told CNN after filing her iReport . Unless it is renewed , the program will end November 1 or when funds allotted by Congress run out , whichever happens first . Trade-ins must be less than 25 years old , and their titles must be free of any liens . Consumers can go to a Web site , cars.gov , to learn the program 's rules .

{"answer":"KATHMANDU , Nepal -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nepal 's government ordered the country 's army chief of staff fired Sunday , touching off street protests and a split in Nepal 's Maoist-dominated ruling coalition . General Rookmangud Katawal gestures after inspecting the guard of honour in New Delhi on December 12 , 2007 . But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal , and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country 's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office , a presidential spokesman said . Nepal 's Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government 's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels , as a 2006 peace deal required . The move prompted the Maoists ' largest coalition partner to quit the government , the party 's leader said . `` Without consensus , the ongoing peace process will not reach its logical conclusion and the drafting of the new constitution will not be possible , '' said Ishwor Pokharel , general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Unified Marxist-Leninist -RRB- . `` The consensus that existed so far has come to standstill . '' Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets for demonstrations Sunday . Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions , there were no serious injuries reported . The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency . Under the deal , more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country 's security forces . But two weeks ago , the government asked Katawal to explain why he went to the Supreme Court to challenge the government 's refusal to extend the tenure of eight brigadier generals in March . Government spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said Sunday that the government was not satisfied with Katawal 's explanation and fired him -- three months before his scheduled retirement -- in a meeting that the Maoists ' coalition partners boycotted . Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country 's parliament . He said the Maoists , led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal , ignored that advice . `` We do not like the way the Maoists ' way of functioning , '' Pokharel said . The Maoists hold 238 of the 601 seats in parliament , while Pokharel 's party has 109 . The Maoists could continue to hold power with the support of smaller parties , but Pokharel said his party is working to form a new ruling coalition . The Cabinet named an interim army chief , but presidential spokesman Rajendra Dahal told CNN that 18 parties in Nepal 's parliament asked Yadav to keep Katawal on the job . There was no immediate reaction from the government on the president 's decision .","question":""}
{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors in Florida are taking a new look at the 2007 death of Anna Nicole Smith to see if recent evidence that California investigators gathered might cause them to open an inquiry . Prosecutors in Florida are reviewing evidence gathered in California for a probe into Anna Nicole Smith 's death . Howard K. Stern -- Smith 's longtime partner and attorney -- and two doctors were charged this month in California with conspiring to furnish drugs to Smith before her fatal overdose . `` Our prosecutors have met with representatives of the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office and the California Department of Justice and discussed the evidence they have turned up in their investigation , '' said Ron Ishoy , a spokesman for Broward County State Attorney Michael Satz . `` We are now examining that evidence to see where it might lead in relation to Ms. Smith 's death here in Broward County in 2007 . '' The Broward County state attorney 's office never opened a probe into Smith 's death but assisted the Seminole police in its investigation in the days afterward . Smith , 39 , was pronounced dead February 8 , 2007 , after being discovered unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood , Florida . A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs . Officials said both prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith 's system , including three anti-depressant or anti-anxiety drugs . Human growth hormone and chloral hydrate , a sleep medication , also were found in toxicology tests , officials said . Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were charged in California with several felonies , including conspiring to furnish controlled substances , unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith 's death . Kapoor and Eroshevich also were charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by `` fraud , deceit or misrepresentation . '' And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address , prosecutors said . `` Anna was the center of a cruel tabloid feeding frenzy , '' Eroshevich 's attorney , Adam Braun , told CNN in a statement after his client was charged . `` In the face of this , Dr. Eroshevich did her best to help the patient while protecting what little privacy Anna had left . Any actions were done with the patient 's well-being in mind and were certainly not criminal . '' Watch allegations over photos and the doctor '' California Attorney General Jerry Brown said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed `` thousands of pills . '' The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star was drugged `` almost to the point of stupefaction , '' Brown said . `` The quantity of the drugs , the variety of the drugs , the combination at any given point , and her continuing to use that -- that , to a professional , is clear evidence of addiction , '' Brown said Friday . `` These cocktails of methadone and anti-depressants and sleeping pills and Xanax , you put all that into a cocktail , it explodes and can cause death , injury and permanent morbidity and disability .

{"answer":"LA PAZ , Bolivia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bolivian officials have declared a health emergency after three deaths attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever , the often-lethal form of a mosquito-borne disease that more than 1,000 Bolivians are thought to have contracted since November . Brazilian soldiers pour insecticide to fight dengue fever in 2008 . Bolivia also is battling the mosquito-borne disease . At least 12 unconfirmed instances of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the first 17 days of 2009 , the official ABI news agency said . About 250 cases of dengue fever , the milder , nonlethal form of the disease , have been confirmed in the past two weeks , said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia in the Los Tiempos de Cochabamba newspaper . Authorities said they have committed more than 20,000 military personnel and 2.5 tons of insecticide to combat the disease . A preteen boy died last week at Children 's Hospital of La Paz , a few days after arriving with internal bleeding , hospital director Christian Fuentes told La Razon newspaper in La Paz , the nation 's capital . `` By that time , there was nothing we could do . He had multiple internal hemorrhages , '' Fuentes said . A 17-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman also died last week , the ABI news agency said , citing the national director of epidemiology , Juan Carlos Arraya . Cases of dengue fever usually spike from November through January , which is Bolivia 's hot and rainy season . Alberto Nogales , the country 's vice minister of health , said the fight against mosquitoes will last until April . Dengue occurs in tropical and subtropical parts of the world , transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of four dengue viruses , the World Health Organization says . Symptoms , which appear three to 14 days after the bite , can include mild to high fever , severe headache , pain behind the eyes , muscle and joint pain and a rash , the WHO says . Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially fatal complication that affects mainly children , the WHO says . Symptoms include fever , abdominal pain , vomiting and bleeding . The disease can not be transmitted directly from one person to another . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are up to 100 million cases worldwide each year . `` It actually is quite common , '' Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC told CNN last year . `` And unfortunately , over the last 30 years or so we 've seen an increase in the number of countries infected with dengue fever . '' Khan attributes the increase in part to population growth . Mosquitoes that carry dengue typically breed in areas near humans . `` This is a disease that occurs where there 's lots of population , '' he said . The WHO says mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in exposed water , including places as shallow as jars , discarded bottles and plant saucers . Last year , 55,000 people in southeastern Brazil contracted the disease . The outbreak was confirmed as causing the deaths of at least 67 people -- almost half of them children under 13 -- and another 58 deaths were under investigation last summer , the Rio de Janeiro state 's ministry of health reported at the time . Final statistics on the outbreak were not immediately available .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man shot his estranged wife to death , along with their son and grandson , before turning the gun on himself as police closed in , authorities in Livingston Parish , Louisiana , said Sunday . Police say Dennis Carter Sr. shot four family members , three fatally , before turning the gun on himself . Dennis Carter Sr. , 50 , also shot and critically injured his pregnant daughter-in-law , the parish sheriff 's office said in a statement . The shootings occurred Saturday night in the town of Holden , Louisiana . Authorities were dispatched to a report of shots fired at a home about 10:40 p.m. Upon arrival , they found three people dead and the fourth -- Amber Carter , 25 -- in critical condition , the statement said . Those killed were Dennis Carter Jr. , 26 , Amber Carter 's husband ; their son Mason Carter , 2 ; and 49-year-old Donna Carter , mother of Dennis Carter Jr. and estranged wife of Dennis Carter Sr. , police said .

{"answer":"New Orleans , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- BP will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , the energy company said Friday . The latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe , collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface , said Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman . The insertion tube was on the sea floor , and engineers planned to move it into place later in the day , Proegler said . The company has lowered a smaller containment dome for use if the insertion tube does not stem the flow of oil into the water , Proegler said . But Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard , said twice Friday that the containment dome , referred to as a `` top hat , '' was the first choice , followed by the insertion tube . Officials could not explain the discrepancy . Neither procedure would be a permanent solution , Allen said Friday in Mississippi . The procedures , he said , `` will reduce the leakage , not stop the leakage . '' The ultimate solution , Allen said , will be achieved by relief wells that are being drilled near the leak site . Those will take weeks , if not months , to complete , BP has said . After much discussion over whether the use of subsea dispersants could cause ecological damage , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said Friday that officials have concluded that it `` is an option we can consider and will move ahead with . '' The decision was made after the results of three tests were analyzed , she said . `` This is not a decision that was made lightly , but it is a series of tradeoffs . You 're really trying to minimize the impact on the environment as best as possible . '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said the company has spent more than $ 450 million responding to the spill and that more than 14,000 people are involved in the effort . To date , more than 1.2 million feet of boom have been deployed and another 400,000 feet of boom have been staged for deployment , he said . In all , the company is trying to accumulate 3.5 million feet of boom . The forecast this weekend and early next week `` looks very favorable to use all tools , '' he said , citing burning , skimming operations and use of surface and subsurface dispersants . Suttles said the spill has had `` limited impact '' on shore , with oil being found in four locations in Louisiana , two in Alabama and one in Mississippi . In Washington , President Barack Obama criticized executives from BP and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe . `` It is absolutely essential that , going forward , we put in place every necessary safeguard and protection so that a tragedy like this oil spill does not happen again , '' Obama said after meeting Friday with Cabinet members to discuss the spill . Read about oil spill responses `` This is a responsibility that all of us share , '' Obama said . `` The oil companies share it . The manufacturers of this equipment share it . The agencies in the federal government in charge of oversight share that responsibility . I will not tolerate more finger-pointing or irresponsibility . '' BP 's efforts to plug the leak come amid growing concern that the company has been low-balling how much oil has poured out of the well . Rep. Edward Markey , D-Massachusetts , sent BP a letter Friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak . Markey , who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment , said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount BP officials have provided . `` The public needs to know the answers to very basic questions : how much oil is leaking into the Gulf and how much oil can be expected to end up on our shores and our ocean environment ? '' Markey said in a letter to BP . `` I am concerned that an underestimation of the flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle management of the disaster . '' Track the oil spill BP has said since the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig that about 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons -- have been pouring out of the well a day . The company says it reached that number using data , satellite images and consultation with the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . `` I think that 's a good range , '' Suttles said Friday . But a researcher at Purdue University said BP 's estimate is low . Associate Professor Steve Wereley said that about 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking each day , based on an analysis of video of the spill . `` You ca n't say with precision , but you can see there 's definitely more coming out of that pipe than people thought , '' he said . `` It 's definitely not 5,000 barrels a day . '' A BP executive rejected that assertion Friday . `` Well , that 's not what our experts , multiple experts , not only from BP , and the industry say , '' said Bob Dudley , BP managing director for the Americas and Asia . `` This crude is what 's called a light-sweet crude . It has lots of gas and when it comes out , it expands very rapidly , a little bit like bubbles in a soda pop . So it 's very difficult to look at it and say that the volume will be much higher . We certainly do n't see that at the surface . '' The dispute over the size of the leak caps a week in which congressional committees grilled executives from BP and two other companies : drilling contractor Transocean Ltd. , which owned the rig , and oilfield services contractor Halliburton , which was responsible for cementing the well shut once drilled . The companies blamed each other . BP pointed to Transocean , which said BP was responsible for the wellhead 's design and Halliburton was responsible for the cement finishing work . Halliburton , in turn , said its workers were just following BP 's orders , but that Transocean was responsible for maintaining the rig 's blowout preventer . iReport : Send your photos , videos Obama took exception Friday . `` I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter , '' the president said . `` You had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else . The American people could not have been impressed with that display , and I certainly was n't . '' Obama said the federal government also was taking responsibility for its role . `` For too long , for a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , '' Obama said . `` It seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies . `` That can not and will not happen anymore . To borrow an old phrase , we will trust , but we will verify . '' As a result , Obama said , the Mineral Management Service will be restructured , with the part of the agency that permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties separated from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting the safety of oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law . `` That way , there 's no conflict of interest , real or perceived , '' Obama said . In addition , Obama said , the administration has ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the Gulf of Mexico , and no drilling permits will be issued until a 30-day safety-and-environmental review is completed . Obama also announced a new examination of the environmental procedures for oil and gas exploration and development . Learn more about efforts to stop the leak BP , the Coast Guard and state and local authorities have scrambled to keep the oil from reaching shore or the ecologically delicate coastal wetlands off Louisiana . They have burned off patches of the slick , deployed more than 280 miles of protective booms , skimmed as much as 4 million gallons of oily water off the surface of the Gulf and pumped more than 400,000 gallons of chemical dispersants onto the oil . On Friday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed off to fishing another part of the Gulf of Mexico over which the federal government has jurisdiction . NOAA has now closed 19,377 square miles -LRB- 50,187 square kilometers -RRB- , which is 8 percent of the Gulf area within 200 miles of the coast , called an exclusive economic zone . The closed area a week earlier had been 4.5 percent . Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the April 20 explosion at the rig , which sank two days later . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead . CNN 's Eric Fiegel , Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S.-led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan has been a tough slog , a nearly eight-year conflict replete with gloom . U.S. Staff Sergeant Robert Brunner secures an area in the Baraki Barak district of Logar Province on August 22 . Lately a lot of the news from Afghanistan seems particularly grim for the United States and its allies . More U.S. troops have been killed there in August than in any month since the war began . There are indications that more U.S. troops could be deployed to the country . The Afghan presidential elections this month were rife with charges of fraud . Corruption plagues the political system . The poppy trade is flourishing . And , in the words of the top U.S. military official , Adm. Mike Mullen , the `` Taliban insurgency has gotten better , more sophisticated . '' Support for the war hit a new low among Americans , a CNN poll found this month . So why do the United States and its allies continue to pour money and troops into Afghanistan ? `` The importance of the place is pretty substantial , '' said Michael O'Hanlon , senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution . Al Qaeda has used that part of the world as a sanctuary , he said . Neighboring Pakistan has been serious about vanquishing the militants there and that helps the fight against militants in Afghanistan . A victory for al Qaeda in a conflict there would represent an important public relations triumph for the militants , he said . He understands why Americans are displeased but said people need to feel that progress is being made in the region . `` We have n't been winning for eight years , '' O'Hanlon said . `` They want to know why . '' U.S. President Barack Obama has tackled the question head-on . The al Qaeda and Taliban militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan represent an urgent threat to the United States , he said in March , just as they were when al Qaeda attacked the United States in 2001 , when the then-ruling Taliban harbored the terror network . `` Many people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question : What is our purpose in Afghanistan ? '' the president said . `` After so many years , they ask , why do our men and women still fight and die there ? And they deserve a straightforward answer . `` So let me be clear : Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9\/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan . `` Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan . And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . '' The questions have come up in Britain , too , where the deaths of 15 British troops in July stirred outrage and criticism of Britain 's strategy in Afghanistan . Prime Minister Gordon Brown told his countrymen that British involvement in that country now is as crucial as it was after the 2001 terrorist attacks . `` In 2001 the case for intervention in Afghanistan was to take on a global terrorist threat and prevent terrorist attacks in Britain and across the world , '' he said . `` In 2009 the overriding reason for our continued involvement is the same -- to take on , at its source , the terrorist threat , and prevent attacks here and elsewhere . '' Obama said the Afghan insurgency `` feeds instability '' in Pakistan and Pakistan extremists have the proven ability to undermine the Afghan government . He cited the importance of confronting the heroin trade that finances the insurgency . Obama has listed several objectives in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan , such as promoting an accountable Afghan government and self-reliant security forces , developing a stable government and strong economy in Pakistan , and disrupting terror networks . Pakistani security forces have been battling militants in the northwestern part of the country , and drone strikes thought to be conducted by the United States have been carried out from Afghanistan against militants in Pakistan . `` The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor , Pakistan , '' Obama said . `` In the nearly eight years since 9\/11 , al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier . `` This almost certainly includes al Qaeda 's leadership : Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri . They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide , to train terrorists , to communicate with followers , to plot attacks , and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan . For the American people , this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world . '' In Britain , Brown said the military effort to clear a region and establish security would be buttressed by Afghan plans `` to build basic services -- clean water , electricity , roads , basic justice , basic health care , and then economic development . '' `` This inevitably takes time , but the important thing is that work has begun , to give the people a stake in the future , '' he said . U.S. Sen. Jim Webb , Democrat-Virginia , said in a recent TV interview that he has `` a lot of concerns about the way we 've articulated our national goals in Afghanistan . '' `` I think that it is extremely important for us to be able to articulate the end point of our strategy , just as it was in Iraq , '' he said . While there is grim news on the ground in Afghanistan , the picture painted by the president in March was a red alert for Americans : It 's a tough but necessary fight that requires patience and resources . `` There are no quick fixes to achieve U.S. national security interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan , '' Obama said . `` The danger of failure is real and the implications are grave .

{"answer":"Seattle , Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators searching for the suspected killer of four Seattle-area police officers have rounded up several of his relatives and friends to keep them from helping him escape , a sheriff 's spokesman said Monday . Police have brought in five or six relatives and other acquaintances of Maurice Clemmons , `` and we expect that number to grow , '' Pierce County Sheriff 's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said . Some of Clemmons ' family and friends have been trying to help him elude police and seek treatment for a gunshot wound , and they have tried to divert investigators by calling in false leads , he said . `` What we 're going to do is eliminate those people , so he 'll have no place to go , '' Troyer told CNN . A raid in the southern Seattle suburb of Renton late Monday was aimed at cutting off Clemmons from that support network , he said . Clemmons , 37 , is an ex-convict with a long rap sheet in Washington and Arkansas , according to authorities and documents . He is wanted in what police called the ambush-style killing of four police officers from Lakewood , near Tacoma , about 40 miles south of Seattle . Witnesses say Clemmons was shot in the torso during the Sunday morning attack , and blood and gauze bandages were found in a truck linked to Clemmons , Troyer said . The sheriff 's department said associates who refuse to cooperate with the investigation could face criminal charges . Clemmons is thought to have slipped away from a home in Seattle 's Leschi neighborhood Sunday night , before police surrounded the residence for about 12 hours . He was not found in the home when the investigators moved in Monday morning , Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters . His escape was `` an unlucky thing for us , and a lucky thing for him , '' Troyer said Monday night . `` But his luck 's going to run out , because he does n't have people to help him do that any more . '' The slain officers , three men and a woman , were killed at a coffee shop in Parkland , a suburb of Tacoma . Early Monday , authorities started identifying Clemmons as a suspect , rather than as someone wanted for questioning . The night before the shootings , Clemmons had threatened to kill police officers , but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings , Troyer said on ABC 's `` Good Morning America . '' Clemmons was accused of child rape and assaulting a police officer in May . He had been released on $ 150,000 bond five days before the shootings , according to court records . After his arrest , Clemmons ' sister told police that he `` had not been himself lately '' and that his behavior was `` unpredictable and erratic . '' `` He had said that the Secret Service was coming to get him because he had written a letter to the president , '' an affidavit quoted her as telling investigators . In addition , neighbors had complained that he had been throwing rocks through their windows . Clemmons ' wife told deputies that she and her husband had argued over a `` newly discovered child , '' and she suggested that was why he went on his rock-throwing spree , according to an arrest affidavit . In 2000 , then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted a 95-year prison sentence for Clemmons , according to documents from the Arkansas Department of Community Correction . He returned to prison in 2001 but was paroled in 2004 . `` Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy , it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state , '' Huckabee 's office said in a statement Sunday night . During his 2008 presidential bid , Huckabee was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate , convicted rapist Wayne DuMond , who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri . Huckabee 's statement brought a sharp response from Troyer on Monday . `` We 're disappointed that Gov. Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington , '' Troyer said . `` We 're guessing that 's probably a spin doctor , not him . '' Sunday 's shooting was the first for the Lakewood police department , which was created five years ago for the town of nearly 60,000 . Until then , the Pierce County Sheriff 's Department provided law-enforcement services there . The slain officers were identified as Sgt. Mark Renninger , 39 ; Officer Ronald Owens , 37 ; Officer Tina Griswold , 40 ; and Officer Greg Richards , 42 . All of them were parents and had been with the department since its inception . `` My worst nightmare has come true , '' Tiffany Ryan , Griswold 's sister , told reporters . `` I ca n't tell you how painful it is to lose my sister . '' Police Chief Bret Farrar told reporters Monday that he has repeatedly been asked how the city 's officers are doing . `` This is how everybody 's doing , '' Farrar said , gesturing to the police force standing behind him . `` They 're here . They 're doing their jobs . They 're working hard . They 're dealing with their loss . ... We 're here to carry on . This is what we do . '' The four officers `` were good people , '' Farrar said , fighting to maintain his composure . `` They were great officers , and we will all miss them very much . '' The Lakewood Independent Police Guild is accepting donations for the officers ' families , said guild president and Lakewood police officer Brian Wurts . Contributions have poured in from as far away as Switzerland , he said . `` I ca n't believe he was out on the street , '' Wurts said of the suspect . `` If they want to rehabilitate them , you can rehabilitate them -- but you rehabilitate them in prison , where they 're supposed to be , '' he added . `` This guy should have never been on the street . '' The coffee shop on Steele Street is a popular hangout for law enforcement officers and is one of 22 Forza Coffee Company locations in Washington . The company 's CEO , Brad Carpenter , is a retired police officer . In a statement on the company Web site , he said the shooting `` hits extremely close to home to me . '' Police said the gunman walked past the officers to the counter as if to order , then pulled a gun out of his coat and began shooting at 8:15 a.m. Sunday . Two of the officers were `` executed '' as they sat at a table , Troyer said . Another was shot when he stood up , and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door , Troyer said . All were in uniform , with their marked patrol cars parked outside . Two baristas and other customers inside the shop were unharmed . `` Just the law enforcement officers were targeted , '' Troyer said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera , a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means `` Shorty , '' is the most wanted man in Mexico . He 's also one of the most wanted men in the United States . Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel , which is battling for turf along the border . For five years , the State Department has kept a $ 5 million bounty on his head , calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security . Guzman , who leads the Sinaloa cartel , is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border . He recently upped the stakes , ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors , according to the Los Angeles Times . The cartel 's tentacles and those of its chief rival , the Gulf cartel , already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta , Georgia ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March . `` No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does , '' said Arabit , who heads the DEA 's office in this year 's border hot spot , El Paso , Texas . See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. . A December 2008 report by the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities . So far , the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico , where the cartels ' running gunbattles with police , the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year . It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007 . Once again , drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year , Arabit said . See who the key players are '' The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker , DEA agents say . But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire . `` It 's coming . I guarantee , it 's coming , '' said Michael Sanders , a DEA spokesman in Washington . Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman 's shoot-to-kill instructions are n't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals ; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials , the Los Angeles Times reported , citing sources and intelligence memos . The move is seen as dangerously brazen , the newspaper reported . In the past , the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement . U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border . The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $ 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border . But $ 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target . Guzman , who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel , is said to be worth $ 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade . He made this year 's Forbes list of the richest of the rich , landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell 's Soup fortune . Popular Mexican songs , called narcocorridos , embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader . `` Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico , '' said security consultant Scott Stewart , invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993 . Stewart , a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor , a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman 's worth . Just a decade ago , Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians , moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean . But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels . The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back . Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits . Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States , according to the DEA . Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine . Marijuana became the cartels ' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007 , bringing in $ 8.5 billion . Cocaine came in second , at $ 3.9 billion , and methamphetamine earned $ 1 billion , a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year . Watch how marijuana became the cartels ' top cash crop '' The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels , but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border , according to the DEA agents , local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN . The cartels ' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa , Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence . The status and alliances of the players continue to shift . Although the DEA and some analysts disagree , others say the Zetas , a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police , are now running the Gulf cartel . `` From what we 've seen , the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel , '' analyst Stewart said . `` In violent times , soldiers tend to rise to the top . '' These soldiers are incredibly well-armed , police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime `` Hummer '' Gonzalez Duran . It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles , including AK-47s ; 287 grenades ; two rocket launchers ; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition . At the very least , the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table . The DEA 's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate . Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , a former military man who is also known as `` El Lazco , '' or `` The Executioner . '' The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border 's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors . The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas ; Sonora Nogales , across from Nogales , Arizona ; and Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , California . Two years ago , the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo , across the border from Laredo , Texas . It 's all about the highways that help move the drugs . Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor , and Juarez has easy access to I-10 , a major east-west interstate , and I-25 , which runs north to Denver , Colorado . Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5 , which heads north all the way to the Canadian border . Some of the battles are internal , Arabit said . Some are with other cartels . And some , he said , can be attributed to the cartels ' `` desperate '' attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers . As soon as he took office in January 2007 , Calderon called out the cartels . He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and , in some cases , do the job of local police . Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office . The violence involves beheadings , running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches . Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight . The cartels ' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets . `` The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq , '' analyst Stewart said . `` It was simple machismo . The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas . '' When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s , the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant , beneficiaries of their location . Today , they are shadows of their former selves , weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders . Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997 . Known as `` The King of the Skies '' for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes , he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest . Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery . Two of them later were killed . His death , along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen , set the stage for the ongoing turf battle . When Cardenas was extradited in 2007 , Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales . Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston , Texas , where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros , Mexico . Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana , and last year , Guzman made a move on that plaza as well . `` Right now , they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar , '' said the DEA 's Elizabeth Kempshall , who heads the agency 's office in Phoenix , Arizona . Phoenix has become the nation 's kidnapping capital , largely because of the cartels ' increasing presence . Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition : `` That is the worst thing for any cartel leader , to face justice in the United States . '' CNN 's Eliott C.

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A registered sex offender has been indicted on 85 counts -- including aggravated murder , rape and kidnapping -- in the deaths of 11 women whose bodies were found at his home , authorities said Tuesday . In addition , Anthony Sowell , 50 , is charged with `` brutalizing '' three women and raping two of them , Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason said . Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Sowell , Mason said . Sowell is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday . Sowell is now charged with 11 counts of aggravated murder with a `` mass murder specification , '' meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion , Mason said . He also is charged with abuse of a corpse , kidnapping and tampering with evidence . The indictment also alleges that Sowell assaulted women on December 8 , 2008 , and on September 22 and October 20 of this year . The September and October victims were raped , and the other woman was punched and choked before she escaped , Mason said . Sowell 's charges in the incidents include attempted murder , rape or attempted rape , kidnapping , robbery and felonious assault . Sowell already faced charges in the September 22 rape and has pleaded not guilty . On October 20 , neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house . Firefighters responded and later notified police . But the woman told officers she fell off the roof while she was at the home `` partying , '' police said earlier . No charges were filed at the time . Mason said , however , that the 51-year-old woman had been invited to Sowell 's home and left , but was lured back in . After being choked and raped , she attempted to escape out a second-floor window as Sowell tried to pull her back in . When he was unsuccessful , he pushed her out , and she lay unconscious in an alley for a while before he pulled her back in the house . Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police , Mason said . It 's possible there are other victims , he said , and he urged anyone who has not come forward to do so . Sowell `` knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it , '' Mason said . As of last month , Sowell was on suicide watch at the request of his public defender , Kathleen DeMetz . She had said a psychiatric evaluation of Sowell had been ordered but was unlikely to happen until after an indictment was filed . Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid said Tuesday that Sowell has been a `` model prisoner , '' is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests . All of the 11 victims were African-American women , authorities have said . Most of them were strangled by ligature -- which could include a string , cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand , officials said . Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks . All that has been found of one woman is a skull that was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home 's basement . Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005 . He was required to register as a sex offender . After the 11 victims were found , police in mid-November used thermal imaging in an attempt to see whether any additional human remains were on the property . They dug certain areas by hand . No more were found . Police and the FBI have said they are looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine whether there are similarities with the remains found at Sowell 's home . The inquiry continues , Mason said Tuesday . Police in Coronado , California , have said they are attempting to determine whether Sowell is linked to a 1979 rape there . Though the statute of limitations has expired , authorities said they would like to provide closure to the victim . Neighbors and police have said that women were seen at Sowell 's home from time to time and that he would offer them alcohol . Police said he also might have offered them drugs . In the September assault , the 36-year-old woman told police that she encountered Sowell while walking in his neighborhood and he took her back to his home , where he became violent and raped her , according to prosecutors . `` While raping her , he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness , '' authorities said in a statement . `` When she regained consciousness , he let her out of the house .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some of the most powerful leaders in American politics came together Thursday to remember Dorothy Height , a woman who dedicated her life to civil rights and justice for the least powerful members of society . President Obama , Vice President Joe Biden , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder led mourners at a memorial service for Height at a packed National Cathedral . Height , a civil rights pioneer , died last week at the age of 98 . She had been chair and president emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women and worked alongside civil rights leaders including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , future U.S. Rep. John Lewis and A. Philip Randolph . She was on the platform when King delivered his `` I Have a Dream '' speech at the 1963 March on Washington . Height 's life was an `` unambiguous record of righteous work , '' Obama said in the service 's eulogy . She `` deserves a place of honor in America 's memory . '' She was a woman of `` quiet , dogged , dignified persistence . '' Height was born in an era when `` Jim Crow ruled the South -LRB- and -RRB- the Klan was on the rise , '' Obama said . `` Progress came slowly . That progress came from the collective efforts of multiple generations of Americans . ... Men and women like Dr. Height took it upon themselves -- often at great risk -- to change this country for the better . '' `` May God bless Dorothy Height and the union that she made more perfect , '' he said . Mourners at the service participated in renditions of `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic '' and the gospel song `` We Are Climbing Jacob 's Ladder . '' Referred to as the `` godmother '' of the civil rights movement , Height was at the center of countless heated debates over social justice in a changing country beginning in the early days of President Franklin Roosevelt 's administration . Among other awards , Height received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994 from President Clinton and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004 . Height led the National Council of Negro Women from 1957 to 1988 , when she became the group 's chair and president emeritus . She was also a key figure in the YWCA beginning in the 1930s . Height was born in Richmond , Virginia , and grew up in Rankin , Pennsylvania . Her civil rights work began in 1933 when she became a leader of the United Christian Youth Movement of North America . She fought to stop lynchings and worked to desegregate the armed forces . Under Height 's leadership , the council worked to help women and low-income families by promoting programs to alleviate hunger and build more affordable housing . The organization also spearheaded voter registration drives and started `` Wednesdays in Mississippi '' in which female interracial groups helped at Freedom Schools , institutions meant to empower African-Americans and address inequalities in how the races were educated . She experienced personal discrimination , writing in her memoir about being rejected from New York 's Barnard College because she was black . `` Although I had been accepted , they could not admit me , '' she wrote in `` Open Wide the Freedom Gates . '' `` It took me a while to realize that their decision was a racial matter : Barnard had a quota of two Negro students per year , and two others had already taken the spots . '' At its 1980 commencement ceremonies , Barnard College awarded Height its highest honor , the Barnard Medal of Distinction .","question":""}
{"answer":"MOGADISHU , Somalia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gunmen attacked a convoy Sunday in Somalia and took several hostages , including two foreign aid workers from the group Doctors Without Borders . Medecins San Frontieres workers , shown here , were abducted and released in March in Sudan . Local staff said a three-car convoy was traveling from Rabbure to Hudur in southwestern Somalia , escorted by local bodyguards , when gunmen seized the group . The district commissioner of Rabbure said the only people released were elders accompanying the staff , with the local and international staff kept as hostages . Doctors Without Borders , widely known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres , did not immediately release the identities or nationalities of the hostages . MSF is an international medical group that works in more than 60 countries . It says it helps people `` threatened by violence , neglect , or catastrophe . '' Michel Peremans , international coordinator for operational communications for MSF Belgium , which operates in the region , confirmed that the organization had lost contact with two of its staff in Somalia . Rabbure is in the Bakole region , which is under the control of the group al-Shabaab , considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department . Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union , which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006 . The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network , and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006 . The ICU 's former leader , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , became president after Ethiopian troops withdrew in January . Al-Shabaab rejected the peace agreement that led to the Ethiopian withdrawal and is now fighting Sheikh Ahmed 's government . Attacks on aid workers in the region are common , and U.N. staff came under attack this year . In Sudan , on the other side of Ethiopia , four workers from Medecins Sans Frontieres were abducted in March and released a few days later . All four -- an Italian doctor , a Canadian nurse , a French coordinator and a Sudanese guard -- worked for the Belgian section of the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres . Sudan last month ordered 13 major aid groups to leave the country after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity .

{"answer":"Johannesburg -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Miffed by a visa delay that led the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to South Africa , Archbishop Desmond Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday , saying it had acted worse than apartheid regimes and had forgotten all that the nation stood for . `` When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government , we never knew until the last moment what their decision was , '' Tutu said at a news conference . `` Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government . `` I have to say that I ca n't believe this . I really ca n't believe this , '' Tutu said . `` You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here . '' The Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time , his spokesman said . Visa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi , India , at the end of August , and original passports were submitted on September 20 , more than two weeks ago , a statement on his website said . However , South Africa 's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa . `` South Africa will not comment on the decision , because it is not our decision , it is his decision , '' according to spokesman Clayson Monyela , who said the visa application was still under consideration . The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events , including a lecture in honor of Tutu 's 80th birthday . Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize . Tutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa 's government , led by the African National Congress -LRB- ANC -RRB- , which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid , or legal racial separation , that was present in South Africa until 1994 . `` You are disgraceful , '' Tutu said about the government . `` You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood . '' The ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed , spokesman Jackson Mtembu said . He said everyone was in the dark about this matter . But he also suggested that Tutu calm down . A comparison to apartheid regimes , he said , was unfair . This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa . In 2009 , South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference , saying it was not in the country 's interest for him to attend . In refusing the 2009 application , South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference , the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup , the global soccer championship it was hosting . `` We can not allow focus to shift to China and Tibet , '' presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said , adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China . The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule , and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy . Speculation surfaced Tuesday that this year 's visit was also affected by South Africa 's relationship with China . South African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties . Motlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage , according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua . But Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China . `` We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest , '' Monyela said . The Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said : `` Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes , Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As thousands gathered Sunday in Washington for a march and rally focused on gay rights issues , lawmakers showed that some of the demonstrators ' key goals face major obstacles ahead . President Obama speaks to a major gay-rights group Saturday night in Washington . Even with President Obama pushing Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act -- a stance he highlighted to one of the nation 's leading gay-rights groups Saturday night , to huge applause -- members of his own party told CNN they 're not in lockstep . `` I 've said in the past I do n't think that 's the way to go , '' Sen. Bob Casey , D-Pennsylvania , told CNN 's John King . He added , `` We can move forward on a lot of measures , but I 'm not sure there 's the support yet for that . '' Sen. Debbie Stabenow , D-Michigan , noted that her state is one of many that has a law prohibiting same-sex marriage . `` So I think , for a number of us , that becomes a challenge , '' she said . Stabenow would not say whether she would vote to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act . The law , signed by President Clinton in 1996 , defines marriage as being between a man and a woman , and ensures that states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states . Clinton has since changed his mind , and said he no longer opposes same-sex marriage . Obama does not support same-sex marriage and has said he believes marriage is between a man and a woman . He does , however , support civil unions for same-sex couples that offer similar rights and protections . The two Democratic senators on Sunday expressed support for the president 's stances on several other key issues regarding gay rights , including legislation expanding the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity . The bill passed the House last week . Both also expressed support for the president 's efforts to end the military 's `` Do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy . On NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Sen. Carl Levin , D-Michigan , said he thinks the president will succeed on that front . `` I think he will and he can , but it has to be done in the right way , which is to get a buy-in from the military , which I think is now possible , '' Levin said . `` Other militaries in the West -- the British and other Western armies -- have ended this discriminatory policy . We can do it successfully , but it ought to be done with thoughtfulness , with care and with a buy-in from the military . '' Retired Gen. Richard Myers , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said , `` Gays can serve in the military ; they just ca n't do so openly . And they do , and there are lots of them , and we 're the beneficiary of all that . '' Myers did not weigh in on whether the change should happen , but said he agreed with Levin that the `` senior military leadership needs to be part of this , the Pentagon needs to be part of this . '' But retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey disagreed . `` There 's no question that it 's time to change the policy . The key to it is n't buy-in from the military ; it 's for Congress to change the law . They ought to do so , and I 'm confident that the military will move ahead on it , '' he said . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , rejected McCaffrey 's suggestion . `` It 's my belief that if you do n't have buy-in from the military , that 's a disservice to the people in the military . They should be included in this . I 'm open-minded to what the military may suggest , but I can tell you I 'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally , '' Graham told NBC . `` If this policy about ` Do n't ask , do n't tell ' changes , it should be done based not on politics , but on reason . '' In his speech Saturday night to the Human Rights Campaign -- the nation 's largest gay rights group -- Obama praised the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledged to deliver on major campaign promises that critics say he 's left on the back burner . `` For nearly 30 years , you 've advocated for those without a voice , '' Obama said . `` Despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open .

The new policy applies to flights in the United States as well as flights to and from Canada , Latin America and the Caribbean . Some airlines have been adding fees to once-free benefits , such as snacks . Despite this cost-cutting , airlines are finding it harder to survive as they get squeezed by soaring fuel costs . `` With record-breaking fuel prices , we must pursue new revenue opportunities while continuing to offer competitive fares , by tailoring our products and services around what our customers value most and are willing to pay for , '' said John Tague , United 's executive vice president and chief operating officer . United said it estimates that the $ 15 fee will apply to one out of three customers , and the potential revenue from baggage handling service fees , including those for checking a first and second bag , will be approximately $ 275 million a year . The move comes a month after American Airlines announced a $ 15 service charge for the first checked bag . Delta , Continental and Northwest told CNN they are not charging for passengers ' first checked bags . However , a spokesman for Northwest said the airline is well aware of changes in the industry . `` We are always keeping an eye on what our competitors are doing , '' the spokesman said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- There is an old adage which goes something like this : `` The cheap man always pays more in the long run . '' Consumer Reports analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database . Consumer Reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars . Consumer Reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher-priced alternative . The report , which appeared in Consumer Reports ' Annual April Auto Issue , was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the Consumer Reports database . In short , the report concluded that a car 's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class . For example , at about $ 17,500 , a Mitsubishi Lancer is priced $ 5,000 less than a Mini Cooper . But when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle , the Lancer could cost drivers about $ 3,000 more to own over the first five years , according to the study . And the purchase price of a Toyota Highlander is about $ 3,000 more than a V6 Ford Explorer -- but the Explorer 's total cost of ownership is an extra $ 6,500 over those five years . The study took into account such factors as depreciation , fuel costs , interest paid on the car loan , insurance , maintenance , repair costs and sales tax . Online subscribers to www.ConsumerReports.org can compare the costs for one , three , five and eight years of ownership . `` We think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around , and settled on a couple of different cars they like , and then have to decide on one or the other , '' noted Cliff Weathers , Consumer Reports ' deputy editor , autos . `` We 're giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision , a tie-breaker , if you will . `` If they 're trying to decide between a Pontiac Solstice and Mazda Miata , for example , they can go to our Web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that five-year period . And in this particular case , the answer would be the Miata -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey . '' Depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase . `` Depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership , '' Weathers explained . `` Depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years . '' Different models depreciate faster , and more significantly , than others . In order to calculate depreciation for this owner-cost comparison , Consumer Reports started with the price that a typically-equipped model generally sells for . If a particular model often sells at a largely-discounted price that was also factored in . Consumer Reports then deducted the wholesale trade-in value of the car at the end of the period , based on data from their Used Car Price Service , Weathers explained . In those cases when Consumer Reports did n't have depreciation data for a new model , it used estimates based on comparable vehicles . The Fuel Factor The second-biggest factor in cost-of-ownership , after depreciation , is fuel costs , which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs . `` Fuel economy can really make a big difference , '' Weathers said . `` If you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon , and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon , that 's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years , if you 're driving 12,000 miles a year . '' Consumer Reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to Consumer Reports ' annual reader survey . Consumer Reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of December 2007 or , if applicable , the price of premium or diesel fuel . Fuel costs were an especially big factor with SUVs , the comparison revealed . Drivers who buy a Dodge Nitro could pay more than $ 10,000 to fill up the tank over a five-year period , for example . But the fuel costs for a similar-sized , more fuel-efficient Toyota RAV4 V6 would be $ 2,000 less during that period . Consumer Reports ' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five-year ownership costs . That figure is based on a five-year loan , with a 15 percent down payment , using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by Bankrate.com in December 2007 . Auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years , according to the Consumer Reports comparison . Car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver 's age , location , and driving record . Auto insurance costs , in some cases , dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs . As an example , Weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and a similarly-priced Acura TL . `` Insurance for the Lancer can cost you $ 2,500 a year or more , based our 2007 figures , '' notes Weathers . `` Meanwhile , the annual car insurance rates for the Acura TL can cost as little as $ 900 . '' Maintenance & Repairs Surprisingly , maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership , Weathers said . The maintenance and repair cost figures used in Consumer Reports ' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual Car Reliability Survey . One notable conclusion reached in the Consumer Reports study is that Lexus models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone , even though Lexus owners reported excellent reliability . The Lexus ES350 racks up an average of $ 2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years . Meanwhile , owners of a comparable Lincoln MKZ can expect to pay only half that much . Another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the Range Rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs , costing about $ 2,000 in the fifth year alone . Meanwhile , the comparable Toyota Land Cruiser costs only $ 600 in that year to maintain and repair . Some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs . For its study , Consumer Reports used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007 . With hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry , Consumer Reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel-sipping vehicles . The report concluded that Toyota Prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models . Specifically , the sale price of a Prius is about $ 7,500 higher than a similarly-sized Chevrolet Cobalt , but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $ 2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs , although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well . Weathers pointed to another interesting finding : `` There are some vehicles , namely BMW , that are very inexpensive to own over first five years , because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period , under the warranty , '' he says . `` But if we take it forward , the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive .

{"answer":"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Department of Veterans Affairs has launched an investigation into whether there is a connection between improperly sterilized endoscopy equipment and a veteran 's positive HIV test . Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , requested that the VA look into potential contamination at its facilities . This comes after more than 10,000 veterans were possibly exposed to HIV and hepatitis at three VA facilities while undergoing colonoscopies and other procedures with equipment that had not been properly cleaned . The VA sent letters to those veterans offering free testing for hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV . `` The VA prides itself on being accountable , and we are extremely concerned about this matter , and as a result we have initiated an investigation , '' Dr. Michael J. Kussman , the VA 's undersecretary for health , said in a news release Friday . `` We have an obligation to provide those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation the care they deserve . '' Along with the positive HIV test , the VA says 16 other veterans have tested positive for hepatitis B and hepatitis C at two VA facilities . Of all the 17 positive test results , 11 were at the VA 's Murfreesboro , Tennessee , facility , and six were from the VA 's Augusta , Georgia , hospital . Thousands of other veterans are being tested at the VA hospital in Miami , and the VA says it is waiting to verify results there . So far , 3,174 veterans have been notified of their test results . VA officials decline to say where the veteran who tested positive for HIV was treated . Watch more on the contamination controversy '' Officials stress that the positive results do n't necessarily mean the equipment is to blame . The VA is conducting an epidemiological investigation at the facilities to determine if the veterans who have tested positive for hepatitis have similar strains of the virus . Meanwhile , lawmakers are also calling for an investigation . In a letter last month to Gen. Eric Shinseki , the secretary of Veterans Affairs , Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , requested that the VA Office of Inspector General `` begin an investigation into the potential problems of contamination ; whether any patient has contracted an infection from unsterilized equipment ; and , most importantly , how we can prevent such problems from happening again . '' The VA says it 's reviewing procedures at other facilities . So far , it says , it has encountered no additional problems . In the meantime , the VA has brought in additional personnel to help with testing and counseling in Miami , Murfreesboro and Augusta . It has also set up a toll-free number that VA patients and their families can call , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for additional information : 1-877-575-7256 . The VA says it will pay for treatment for the infected vets even if they did n't get hepatitis or HIV from the dirty equipment . `` We are making sure to take corrective measures to ensure veterans have the information and the care necessary to deal with this unacceptable development , '' Kussman said .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CNN has reported President Obama has personally met with four leading candidates for the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy . The president is expected to announce his nominee in coming days so the Senate can complete the confirmation process in time for the new Supreme Court session in the fall . Justice John Paul Stevens , who turned 90 last month , announced that he will retire shortly after the Supreme Court 's term ends in late June . Here are summaries of the four people believed to be finalists for the Stevens seat , and a list of arguments for and against their nominations : Elena Kagan U.S. Solicitor General Year born : 1960 Hometown : New York -LRB- Manhattan -RRB- Experience : Solicitor general ; Harvard Law School dean ; White House associate counsel Education : Princeton University ; Oxford University ; J.D. , Harvard Law School Fun fact : Former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall , who nicknamed her `` Shorty '' Top cases argued as solicitor general -LRB- in support of federal laws or executive action -RRB- : \u2022 Campaign finance reform -LRB- Citizens United v. FEC , 2009 -RRB- : Congressional efforts to restrict `` independent spending '' by corporations and unions in federal political campaigns . Supreme Court ruled against the government in January . \u2022 Terror support -LRB- Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 2010 -RRB- : Whether the government 's power to criminalize `` material support '' of a terrorist organization goes too far in restricting civil liberties . Supreme Court ruling pending . \u2022 Religious monuments -LRB- Salazar v. Buono , 2009 -RRB- : Can a war memorial shaped like a cross remain on government parkland , or does it violate the constitutional separation of church and state ? Justices ruled for the government , saying the cross should remain . Why she may be chosen : Her lack of a substantive paper trail on hot-button issues may blunt initial conservative criticism over where she stands on these topics . She has a reputation as a political pragmatist and consensus-builder who enjoys the support of liberal and conservative academics . That perceived ability to reach across the aisle could help Kagan on a divided high court . Her relative youth -LRB- she would be the youngest member of the court -RRB- could give Obama a longer judicial legacy . She also would provide greater gender diversity to the bench . Why she may be passed over : That lack of judicial experience may raise concerns about whether she would be a `` reliable '' vote on the left . Some liberal groups have also raised concerns that Kagan -- as solicitor general -- has articulated a more robust defense of executive power by the White House than many civil rights and human rights groups would like . Judge Diane Wood 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , Chicago , Illinois Year born : 1950 Hometowns : Plainfield , New Jersey ; Houston , Texas Experience : Federal appeals judge ; University of Chicago law professor ; government lawyer in the Carter , Reagan and Clinton administrations Education : B.A. , J.D. , University of Texas Fun fact : Talented oboe player who plays in local orchestras Top cases as federal appeals judge : \u2022 Abortion protests -LRB- National Organization for Women vs. Scheidler , 2001 -RRB- : Wrote the opinion allowing extortion and anti-racketeering -LRB- RICO -RRB- laws to be used against a group of anti-abortion protesters . The case was reversed twice by the Supreme Court , 8-1 and 8-0 . \u2022 First Amendment -LRB- Doe v. Lafayette , 2004 -RRB- -- Dissented in a case that ruled a convicted sex offender could be banned from an Indiana city 's parks . The offender admitted observing minors there but left without molesting them . \u2022 Religious displays -LRB- Bloch v. Frischolz and Shoreline Towers Condominium Association , 2008 -RRB- : Disagreed in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a Chicago family from putting up a Jewish decoration on their doorpost . Her strong dissent prompted Wood 's entire court to reconsider , which then reversed and adopted her views on the issue . Why she may be chosen : Sharp intellect and consensus-building skills have served her well on a court dominated by conservative judges . Her gender , Midwest base , non-Ivy league education and long academic record would bring diversity to the high court . She also would be the only Protestant on the bench . Wood 's working mother status would be seen as a political plus for a White House courting female voters . Why she may be passed over : Her judicial record on abortion , religion and immigration cases could present serious roadblocks . Conservatives have privately said she would be the least acceptable of the top contenders , and vow a political fight over her nomination . Her age -LRB- she turns 60 on July 4 -RRB- also could hurt her chances . Judge Merrick Garland D.C. Circuit , U.S. Court of Appeals , Washington Year born : 1952 Hometown : Chicago Experience : Federal appeals judge ; Justice Department lawyer in the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations Education : B.A. , J.D. , Harvard University Law School Fun facts : Met President Richard Nixon as a 17-year-old high school student as part of Presidential Scholars program .

Gates , 2008 -RRB- : Wrote opinion that concluded the government improperly classified a Guantanamo detainee as an enemy combatant . \u2022 Discrimination -LRB- Barbour v. WMATA , 2004 -RRB- : Allowed a Washington , D.C. , government worker to sue for disability discrimination . He was supported in the ruling by then-colleague and good friend John Roberts , now chief justice . \u2022 Environment -LRB- Rancho Viejo v. Norton , 2003 -RRB- : Parted ways with Roberts by refusing to rehear a case over federal protection for the rare arroyo toad , and sided against a California developer who challenged the Endangered Species Act . Why he may be chosen : Little controversy is noted in his personal and professional lives . Colleagues call him a brilliant legal mind , well-respected by nearly everyone . He is viewed as a liberal moderate , and many conservative activists say they could support his nomination . That tacit endorsement could erase any protracted political fight , if the White House seeks a smooth , swift confirmation . Why he may be passed over : Many liberals question his ideological credentials , and fear that as the replacement for the left-leaning Stevens , Garland could move the court incrementally to the right on a number of key issues . He would add little diversity to the court , being a white male with an Ivy League background . Judge Sidney Thomas 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , San Francisco , California ; he is based in Billings , Montana Year born : 1953 Hometown : Bozeman , Montana Experience : Federal appeals judge ; private attorney Education : Montana State University ; J.D. , University of Montana Law School Fun fact : Enjoys skiing and hiking with his wife and two sons , friends say Top cases as federal appeals judge : \u2022 Strip searches -LRB- Bull v. City and County of San Francisco , 2006 -RRB- : Wrote opinion striking down San Francisco 's body-cavity strip search policy for all newly arrested inmates .

Poway Unified School District , 2006 -RRB- : Supported a San Diego high school that banned a student from wearing a T-shirt reading `` Homosexuality is Shameful , '' saying such expressions are disruptive and that gay students and school personnel have a right to be free of such messages , especially in school campus settings . \u2022 Terror prevention -LRB- Public Citizen v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission , 2009 -RRB- : Dissented in this national security case , where the majority said federal regulators could not be ordered to require greater safety measures at nuclear power plants . The commission `` owes the public a rational and reasonable explanation why it would exclude from its -LSB- safety -RSB- rule consideration of terrorist air attacks , '' Thomas said . Why he may be chosen : Western roots would add real regional diversity to the court , and his home-state education may be seen as a plus for a bench dominated by Ivy leaguers . Little is known about him inside the Beltway , but colleagues praise his low-key demeanor , plain-talking intelligence and quiet sense of humor . Why he may be passed over : On a court with a majority of five white males , Thomas would not add much diversity , if the president deems that an important quality . His low profile may not give him many strong supporters among the president 's closest aides . Friends privately say Thomas himself is downplaying his chances , and that he is surprised just to be considered among the finalists and to have had a personal meeting with Obama on the vacancy .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera , a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means '' Shorty , '' is the most wanted man in Mexico . He 's also one of the most wanted men in the United States . Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel , which is battling for turf along the border . For five years , the State Department has kept a $ 5 million bounty on his head , calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security . Guzman , who leads the Sinaloa cartel , is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border . He recently upped the stakes , ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors , according to the Los Angeles Times . The cartel 's tentacles and those of its chief rival , the Gulf cartel , already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta , Georgia ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March . `` No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does , '' said Arabit , who heads the DEA 's office in this year 's border hot spot , El Paso , Texas . See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. . A December 2008 report by the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities . So far , the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico , where the cartels ' running gunbattles with police , the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year . It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007 . Once again , drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year , Arabit said . See who the key players are '' The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker , DEA agents say . But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire . `` It 's coming . I guarantee , it 's coming , '' said Michael Sanders , a DEA spokesman in Washington . Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman 's shoot-to-kill instructions are n't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals ; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials , the Los Angeles Times reported , citing sources and intelligence memos . The move is seen as dangerously brazen , the newspaper reported . In the past , the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement . U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border . The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $ 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border . But $ 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target . Guzman , who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel , is said to be worth $ 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade . He made this year 's Forbes list of the richest of the rich , landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell 's Soup fortune . Popular Mexican songs , called narcocorridos , embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader . `` Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico , '' said security consultant Scott Stewart , invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993 . Stewart , a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor , a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman 's worth . Just a decade ago , Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians , moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean . But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels . The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back . Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits . Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States , according to the DEA . Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine . Marijuana became the cartels ' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007 , bringing in $ 8.5 billion . Cocaine came in second , at $ 3.9 billion , and methamphetamine earned $ 1 billion , a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year . Watch how marijuana became the cartels ' top cash crop '' The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels , but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border , according to the DEA agents , local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN . The cartels ' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa , Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence . The status and alliances of the players continue to shift . Although the DEA and some analysts disagree , others say the Zetas , a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police , are now running the Gulf cartel . `` From what we 've seen , the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel , '' analyst Stewart said . `` In violent times , soldiers tend to rise to the top . '' These soldiers are incredibly well-armed , police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime `` Hummer '' Gonzalez Duran . It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles , including AK-47s ; 287 grenades ; two rocket launchers ; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition . At the very least , the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table . The DEA 's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate . Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , a former military man who is also known as `` El Lazco , '' or `` The Executioner . '' The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border 's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors . The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas ; Sonora Nogales , across from Nogales , Arizona ; and Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , California . Two years ago , the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo , across the border from Laredo , Texas . It 's all about the highways that help move the drugs . Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor , and Juarez has easy access to I-10 , a major east-west interstate , and I-25 , which runs north to Denver , Colorado . Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5 , which heads north all the way to the Canadian border . Some of the battles are internal , Arabit said . Some are with other cartels . And some , he said , can be attributed to the cartels ' `` desperate '' attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers . As soon as he took office in January 2007 , Calderon called out the cartels . He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and , in some cases , do the job of local police . Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office . The violence involves beheadings , running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches . Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight . The cartels ' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets . `` The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq , '' analyst Stewart said . `` It was simple machismo . The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas . '' When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s , the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant , beneficiaries of their location . Today , they are shadows of their former selves , weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders . Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997 . Known as `` The King of the Skies '' for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes , he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest . Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery . Two of them later were killed . His death , along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen , set the stage for the ongoing turf battle . When Cardenas was extradited in 2007 , Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales . Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston , Texas , where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros , Mexico . Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana , and last year , Guzman made a move on that plaza as well . `` Right now , they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar , '' said the DEA 's Elizabeth Kempshall , who heads the agency 's office in Phoenix , Arizona . Phoenix has become the nation 's kidnapping capital , largely because of the cartels ' increasing presence . Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition : `` That is the worst thing for any cartel leader , to face justice in the United States . '' CNN 's Eliott C.

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms , vehicles and other public places , according to an inspector general report . The officers , with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , `` did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and , as a result , lost a significant number of firearms '' between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008 , the report said . In all , 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period , according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner . Of those , 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers ' control -- for instance , ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer . Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes . But 74 percent , or 179 guns , were lost `` because officers did not properly secure them , '' the report said . Following a review of the draft report in December , Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy , according to a response in the report . A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment . The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms . `` Instead , DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms , '' it said . `` Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient , personnel did not always follow them . '' The inspector general cited several examples of `` inappropriate practices . '' A customs officer , for instance , left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store . The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside . `` A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler , '' the report said . In addition , an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home . Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon , according to the report . Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant , and it was gone when he returned . `` Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot , a bowling alley and a clothing store , '' the report said . `` Although our review focused on CBP and ICE , other components described similar incidents . For example , a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle ; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later , '' said the report . `` Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons . '' Of the 179 lost because of laxity , 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost , the report said . That resulted from the agencies ' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms , as well as `` a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm . `` Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen , our analysis showed that these firearms were lost -LRB- stolen -RRB- because officers left the firearms unsecured , '' according to the report . `` All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms . '' The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer , the report said . The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers , but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard , the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center .","question":""}

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected in November 2007 . As a student of History at the University of Gdansk in the late 1970s , a period of growing discontent with the Communist regime in Poland , he became actively involved in the creation of the opposition Students ' Solidarity Committee , founded in reaction to the murder of student activist Stanislaw Pyjas by the State Security Service .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alexander Haig , who managed the Nixon administration during the Watergate crisis and served a controversial stint as secretary of state under President Reagan , died on Saturday . He was 85 . Haig died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland , after he was admitted there on January 28 , spokesman Gary Stephenson said . `` He served his country well . For that he should be remembered , '' said William Bennett , who was secretary of education during the Reagan administration . `` He carried himself well . He carried himself with dignity and honor . '' The White House issued a statement mourning Haig , saying he `` exemplified our finest warrior-diplomat tradition of those who dedicate their lives to public service . '' A top official in the administrations of three presidents -- Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan -- Haig served as Nixon 's chief of staff during the Watergate political crisis , a scandal that dogged the administration in the 1970s . `` There was a time during the Watergate crisis when President Nixon was nearly incapacitated , '' said political analyst and CNN contributor David Gergen , who worked with Haig during the Nixon and Reagan administrations . `` He had a hard time focusing , so obviously obsessed with the scandal and the gathering storms around him . I watched Al Haig keep the government moving . I thought it was a great act of statesmanship and service to the country . '' Haig became secretary of state during the Reagan administration and drew controversy for his much-criticized remark on television after the president was shot and wounded by John Hinckley in March 1981 . `` As of now , I am in control here in the White House , '' Haig said as Vice President George H.W. Bush was headed to Washington from Texas . Haig said he was n't bypassing the rules ; he was just trying to manage the crisis until the vice president arrived . However , he was highly criticized for his behavior , and many observers believe it doomed his political ambitions . Born December 2 , 1924 , in Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania , a suburb of Philadelphia , Alexander Meigs Haig Jr. was raised by his mother after he lost his father at age 10 . He attended the University of Notre Dame for two years before transferring to the U.S. Military Academy in 1944 . After his graduation in 1947 , he served in Japan and later served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's staff in Japan during the Korean War . He also served in Vietnam , where he earned the distinguished service cross for heroism in combat . He also won the Purple Heart and Silver Star twice . Haig served as supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe for five years . There was an assassination attempt on him in Brussels in 1979 as he was being driven to NATO headquarters . A public official known for his loyalty , Haig had hawkish foreign policy views , and Gergen said he could be tough and `` combustible . '' `` He was first and foremost a soldier , '' Gergen said . Haig was assistant to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the Nixon White House and was involved in the Paris peace agreements that brought an end to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . He was long rumored to be Deep Throat , the Washington Post 's inside source on the Watergate break-in and cover-up that eventually destroyed Nixon 's presidency . W. Mark Felt , then a high-ranking FBI official , declared in 2005 that he was the source . `` Great tensions '' in the Reagan administration simmered over his stances , and Gergen said , `` There was a sense in the White House that he was grabbing too much power . `` He wanted to be the , quote , vicar of foreign policy , and there was a lot of pushback from the White House on that . He felt that he had been guaranteed by Ronald Reagan a role as a strong secretary of state and the reins of power would be in his hands . He resented the White House staff trying to manage him , '' Gergen said . `` My own sense is that he has been underappreciated , '' he said . TIME : Read why Haig left the Reagan White House As secretary of state , Haig tried shuttle diplomacy to head off war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982 , but he failed . He opposed Reagan 's handling of Iran and disagreed with the president 's plan on aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua . He eventually left the Reagan administration after 18 months and made a run for president in 1988 , pulling out before the New Hampshire primary . He backed Bob Dole instead of George H.W. Bush when he dropped out . Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton announced Haig 's death to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Saturday and called him a patriot .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Union leaders , the White House and congressional Democrats have agreed to limit the reach of a tax on high-end health insurance plans that would help pay for a proposed overhaul of the U.S. health care system , union leaders involved in the talks said Thursday . The proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $ 23,000 to $ 24,000 for families and from $ 8,500 to $ 8,900 for individuals , AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters . Dental and vision benefits wo n't be counted toward that amount after 2014 , he said . Health plans covered by union contracts would not be subject to the 40 percent tax until 2018 -- a transition period union leaders said is comparable to those offered to other private insurers . The threshold for taxing other plans will be adjusted by 1 percent above the annual rate of inflation , and plans involving large numbers of women or the elderly will get breaks as well , Trumka said . The changes will reduce the $ 150 billion expected to be raised over 10 years by about $ 60 billion , he said . And union plans would be able to enter the health care exchanges set up under the bill in 2017 , he said . The tax on what have been dubbed `` Cadillac '' health care plans is a key feature of the Senate health care bill , but it has drawn opposition from Democrats in the House of Representatives and from unions . President Obama , who has made health care his top priority in Congress , supports the excise tax as a way to contain the rise of health-care costs . Trumka and other top union officials have held a series of talks at the White House for the past three days as congressional negotiators tried to merge the two bills together . He warned earlier this week that congressional Democratic candidates could risk losing labor 's support if the final bill included a tax on high-cost health plans . But he said that despite all-but-total Republican opposition in both houses of Congress , supporters of health care reform stood `` on the threshold of a milestone . '' `` We do n't look at this as the end of our fight for real reform , but another step along the way in the quest for real reform , '' Trumka said . Labor leaders said the changes they negotiated would help not only union members , who make up about 12 percent of the U.S. work force , but all working families . But Don Stewart , a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , dismissed the plan as `` a sweetheart deal . '' `` Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill , '' he said . `` Another sweetheart deal is n't going to turn that around . '' A CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Thursday found much stronger support for the financing plan in the House bill , which would impose a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on incomes higher than $ 500,000 for individuals or $ 1 million for couples . The survey found 61 percent of the public favors the House provision , while the Senate bill drew 29 percent support . Trumka told reporters that leading Democrats were behind the compromise . But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , said she had not seen anything in writing Thursday evening . Rep. Joe Courtney , D-Connecticut , a leading opponent of the excise tax , said the proposal was more fair than the current Senate bill . `` However , the devil is in the details , and I will reserve judgment on any compromise until I have had the time to review the proposal , '' he said in a written statement . Obama did not directly address the plan as he addressed reporters ahead of a House Democratic Caucus meeting Thursday night . But he dared Republicans to run in the November midterm elections on a platform of rolling back `` something that Washington has been talking about since Teddy Roosevelt was president . '' `` If Republicans want to campaign against what we 've done by standing up for the status quo and for insurance companies over American families and businesses , that is a fight I want to have . If their best idea is to return to the bad policies and the bad ideas of yesterday , they are going to lose that argument . '' Democratic negotiators planned to return to the White House late Thursday . A senior leadership aide said Democratic leaders and White House officials want to send the bulk of the health care package to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate soon -- even as soon as the end of this week . The aide said the controversial issues of abortion and immigration are not likely to be resolved by then , but because they would have no impact on the cost of the bill , negotiators could work out those details separately . House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Maryland , said negotiators are working to get agreement on the overall health care package by the end of this week . `` That 's been the goal . But it 's a goal , it 's not a deadline , '' Hoyer said . CNN 's Dana Bash , Deirdre Walsh , Ted Barrett , Lisa Desjardins and Matt Smith contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo lifted martial law in the country 's south , which she declared after the massacre of 57 people last month , Philippine news outlets reported Saturday . The order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. -LRB- 8 a.m. ET -RRB- Saturday , the Philippines News Agency -LRB- PNA -RRB- and CNN affiliate ABS-CBN said . Military troops will remain in Maguindanao province to keep the peace despite the move , said Victor Ibrado , chief of staff of the Philippine armed forces , PNA said . Arroyo imposed martial law December 4 but lifted it Saturday after deciding it had achieved its objectives , Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said , according to PNA . Local government was now back in power and the justice system was functioning again , he said . Authorities have said the November 23 massacre in Maguindanao province was a politically motivated attempt to keep an opponent of the politically powerful Ampatuan family from running for governor . Thirty journalists were among those killed . The martial law allowed arrests without warrants , and at least six members of the Ampatuan family -- including a local mayor -- were arrested , according to ABS-CBN . Authorities raided a warehouse and ranch belonging to the family last weekend and confiscated firearms , ammunition and vehicles , Maj. Randolph Cabangbang , deputy of operations for the eastern Mindanao command , told CNN . Ermita said Saturday that three charges of multiple murders were filed in court , and that 24 people were charged with rebellion . The Philippine National Police has referred nearly 900 other cases to the Department of Justice , he said . Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines . The Maguindanao massacre , however , is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history , according to state media . The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael `` Toto '' Mangudadatu , who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao . He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr. , the father of the accused mayor , saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself . Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao , which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation .","question":""}
{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The attackers who planted a car bomb outside a courthouse in Northern Ireland Monday night gave only 17 minutes warning before the explosion , the Police Service of Northern Ireland told CNN Tuesday . `` It is a miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured , '' PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott said . `` It is only thanks to a member of the public contacting us that we are not dealing with fatalities this morning . '' The car was packed with about 250 pounds -LRB- 113 kilograms -RRB- of explosives , police estimate . A local hospital in the town of Newry got a warning call at 10:20 p.m. local time -LRB- 7:20 p.m. ET -RRB- and a business was phoned two minutes later . The bomb went off at 10:37 p.m. , a police representative said . That `` is not enough time to evacuate a public area , '' a police representative said . British police spokesmen traditionally do not identify themselves by name . A member of the public reported a car being abandoned at about 10 p.m. , she said . That appears to have given police extra time to respond . Baggott blamed the attack on `` dissident republicans , '' pro-Irish militants who reject the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that sharply reduced violence in the province . They `` simply want to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of the past , '' Baggott said , condemning `` cowardly attacks '' by `` terrorists '' who `` want to destroy all that is good about Northern Ireland and have no place in a modern civilized society . '' `` This is not an attack on a court building , this is an attack on people whose lives depend on the well-being of Newry , '' he added . `` This is an attack that broke and damaged places of worship ... damaged the ability of Newry to be at the heart of our economic success . '' Newry is about 35 miles -LRB- 56 kilometers -RRB- south of the provincial capital , Belfast . Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's office `` strongly condemned '' the bombing , saying Tuesday it was the work of a `` tiny minority . '' The `` attack '' is `` entirely unrepresentative of the views of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland , '' said a statement from Brown 's Downing Street office . The court building was badly damaged and businesses in the area were evacuated , police said . Northern Ireland was wracked for decades by violence between pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans . About 3,000 people died in the `` Troubles , '' as the violence was known , before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out in 1998 . There has been sporadic violence since then . A booby-trapped car exploded on January 8 , severely injuring Constable Peadar Heffron . A car bomb partly exploded outside the headquarters of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland on November 21 , and another under-car booby trap exploded on October 22 in east Belfast , injuring a woman , the PSNI said . Two soldiers and a policeman were shot dead in separate attacks in March 2009 . The two biggest parties in the province , the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the pro-Irish Sinn Fein , reached a deal earlier this month to bring police powers under local control , averting a crisis that had threatened to force new elections .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three Staten Island men are charged with violating voting rights , accused of assaulting African-Americans after Barack Obama 's win in the November presidential election , authorities said Wednesday . A grand jury indicted Ralph Nicoletti , 18 , Michael Contreras , 18 , and Brian Carranza , 21 , on charges of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights . All three pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday afternoon . According to the indictment , the three `` knowingly and intentionally '' conspired to intimidate African-Americans `` in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right , to wit , the right to vote . '' Nicoletti and Carranza are white , and Contreras is Latino . They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . At the arraignment , Nicoletti and Contreras were ordered held without bail , while Carranza was released on a $ 200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device . Contreras ' attorney , public defender Len Kamdang , could not be reached for comment . Nicoletti 's attorney , Bob LaRusso , had no comment . Prosecutors said in court filings that on the night of November 4 , the defendants were at a `` makeshift outdoor clubhouse '' in the Rosebank section of Staten Island when they learned of Obama 's victory . At that point , prosecutors said , Nicoletti drove Contreras , Carranza and another friend to the predominantly African-American Park Hill neighborhood in Staten Island . Their purpose , prosecutors said , was to assault African-Americans because of Obama 's win . Their first victim , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office , was 17-year-old Ali Kamara , whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton . Kamara escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs . `` The first swing that swung -- it hit my head . It cut my head , '' Kamara told CNN affiliate WABC . `` I got staples on my head now . '' Kamara said he hid in a neighbor 's backyard until the boys moved on . Continuing to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island , the group assaulted a second African-American man , pushing him down , the federal prosecutors alleged . They then allegedly accosted a Latino man , demanding to know how he voted , and shouted profanities about Obama at a group of African-Americans at a hair salon . Next , prosecutors said , the group targeted Ronald Forte , a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American who was walking along Blackford Avenue in predominantly African-American Port Richmond . Forte is white , but because he was wearing a hoodie , the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was African-American . According to the indictment , the men decided to assault Forte with the police baton as they drove by , but at the last moment , Nicoletti swerved the vehicle directly into the 38-year-old man instead . Forte was thrown onto the hood of the car , shattering the front windshield . According to Staten Island Real Time News -LRB- silive.com -RRB- , Forte was in a coma for 45 days , returning to his family 's home in New Jersey in mid-December , said his mother , Eileen . She added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems . `` He 's not good . He 's never going to be good , '' she said . `` Every day , I just see something different , and it 's so scary . '' U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell decried the attacks . `` Violence and intimidation aimed at interfering with the constitutional rights of every citizen , including the right to vote , will not be tolerated , '' he said in a written statement . According to the U.S. Attorney 's Office , Nicoletti has an extensive history of violent criminal activity including burglary , car break-ins , firebombing , assault , and marijuana and cocaine distribution . He is also a member of the `` Rosebank Crew '' -LRB- RBK -RRB- founded by his now-incarcerated younger brother , Anthony Nicoletti . Investigators found a cache of weapons and police batons stolen from vehicles owned by police , as well as letters from Nicoletti 's brother urging Ralph to maintain RBK loyalty and not cooperate with authorities . Nicoletti and three others approached Contreras three weeks ago at his house , believing he was cooperating with authorities , according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney 's Office . They allegedly attacked him and called him a snitch , according to a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pamela Chen and Margo Brodie to the judge in the case . The letter petitions for home confinement , drug testing and other pretrial release conditions for Nicoletti and Carranza . The judge has not responded to the request .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Maryland man believed to have shot and stabbed his wife and three young children to death before killing himself with a shotgun was having money problems and left a note saying he suffered from `` psychological issues , '' authorities said . Five people , including three young children , were found dead in this house in Middletown , Maryland . Christopher Wood , 34 , may have slashed at least some of his family members in the killings and used a small-caliber handgun on others , Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said . He was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun wound at the foot of the bed where the bodies of his wife and 2-year-old daughter lay , the sheriff said . Wood 's sons were 5 and 4 years old , authorities said . His wife , Francie Billotti Wood , was 33 . The boys were found in their beds in a single bedroom , the sheriff said . Authorities did not release the names of the children . `` These are horrific incidents , '' said Jenkins , who said he could n't remember another homicide in the past 20 years in Middletown , a one-stoplight town northwest of Baltimore . `` No one should ever have to be exposed to this . '' Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home . While the notes did n't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings , they did provide some insight into possible problems . `` There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood , '' Jenkins said . There was `` a mention of some medication '' in that note , according to the sheriff . Jenkins said the sheriff 's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Wood 's home . He said investigators also have learned of money problems for Wood , a salesman for CSX Railroad . `` We are aware there were some , maybe , debt problems -- some financial problems , '' Jenkins said . Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies went to the home shortly after 9 a.m. after Mrs. Wood 's father called .

'' Watch views from the crime scene '' He said the road the Woods lived on is a shortcut to the church and he would often see the children while riding a scooter he uses when the weather is good . `` They would always stop and wave and get big eyes as the scooter came by , '' he said . `` They were very happy kids . '' Jenkins said autopsies will be performed on the bodies over the next few days and that it could be weeks before the results are ready to be released . Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home .

Pakistani army trucks move military equipment into the troubled Buner district Thursday . So far , 14 militants have been killed in the past 24 hours , Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said . The operation is still ongoing in the districts of Dir and Buner , which was recently seized by the Taliban in violation of an agreement with Pakistan 's government . Pakistani forces have completely secured Daggar , the main town in Buner and the scene of heavy fighting on Wednesday , Abbas said . The Daggar operation resulted in the deaths of 50 militants , but freed 18 Frontier Corps personnel who had been abducted by militants , he said . Fifty-two of their colleagues are still believed to be held by their suspected Taliban kidnappers . This week 's military operation has resulted in more than 180 militant casualties since Sunday , while the military has suffered one death and one injury , according to Abbas . He said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week . Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night vision technology , Abbas said Thursday . Most of this week 's casualties happened on Tuesday , when Pakistani fighter jets launched airstrikes , killing at least 70 militants in the Dir district , according to the Pakistani military . The operation is part of the Pakistani army 's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions . The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan . As a result , the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan , which have rankled relations between the two countries . The military campaign has apparently not stopped Washington from carrying out unmanned drone attacks on Pakistan 's soil . A suspected unmanned aerial vehicle killed six people Wednesday night in the village of Kaniguran in the tribal district of South Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan , Pakistani intelligence sources said . Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are American airstrikes on its territory . The U.S. military in Afghanistan has not commented on the strikes , which typically target Taliban fighters in the border region . But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled drones . U.S. President Barack Obama is `` gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan , '' he told reporters Wednesday night . Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . '' But he stressed he was more concerned about the ability of Pakistan 's civilian government to `` deliver basic services , '' and not `` that they 're immediately going to be overrun '' by the Taliban . Pakistan 's recent military crackdown has led to an exodus of civilians from the region . At least 33,000 residents have left their homes in the midst of the recent fighting , according to Amnesty International . Civilians fleeing from Lower Dir in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province join more than 500,000 people already displaced by the fighting , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said . The Pakistani military completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in Dir Tuesday , and is now focusing on the Buner district , Abbas said . About 300 militants entered Buner a few days ago , in violation of the Taliban 's recent agreement to leave the district , he said . Buner is about 60 miles from Islamabad , but Abbas said the militants pose no threat of entering the capital . The fighter jets pounded targets in Buner and the Swat Valley in an effort to block the militants ' entry and exit points , according to Abbas .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj arrived home in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum early Friday after nearly six years in the U.S. Navy prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj at a hospital in Khartoum after his release from Guantanamo Bay . `` I was so happy that I cried , '' al-Hajj told the Qatar-based Arabic news network by phone from his hospital room , where he was taken after arriving at the airport . `` It is our right to be happy and to rejoice , but we also miss our brothers that we left behind and who live in very difficult conditions . '' An official with the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer brought to an end a matter that the United States and Sudan considered to be `` of great mutual concern . '' Al-Hajj , a Sudanese citizen in his late 30s , was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by Pakistani intelligence officers and handed over to the United States , which accused him of being an `` enemy combatant . '' A senior Pentagon official confirmed the journalist 's release . Al-Hajj was held without being charged or given a trial , Al-Jazeera reported . The cameraman was on a legitimate assignment and carried a work visa at the time of his capture , the network said . It also reported that the U.S. plane that carried al-Hajj had about 20 other former detainees aboard who also had been released from Guantanamo Bay . The plane dropped off a Moroccan national , identified as Al-Saeed Bou Jaadiya , the network said . Al-Jazeera aired video showing a bearded al-Hajj being carried from the plane in Khartoum by U.S. military personnel and laid on a stretcher . He was transported to Al-Amal Hospital . `` He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher , '' said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital . `` He was exhausted and very sick , and he 's receiving the necessary care in the hospital . '' Khanfar said he was awaiting word from doctors on his medical condition . In a statement , U.S. Charge D'Affaires Alberto Fernandez of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer `` is a result of many factors and the work of many hands . An important one was the cooperation between the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Intelligence and Security Service . '' Al-Hajj had been on a hunger strike for more than a year and was being force-fed , said Zachary Katznelson , a lawyer who has worked on al-Hajj 's case since August 2005 and last visited him three weeks ago . `` Al-Hajj is remarkably thin , '' Katznelson said . `` He looks like an ill man . '' The journalist was conscious , but did not appear to speak to anyone as paramedics rolled his stretcher inside . Family members stooped to kiss him as the gurney passed . `` I would have hoped they were here with me now . I look forward to the moment , '' al-Hajj said told Al-Jazeera before being reunited with his family . Earlier , al-Hajj 's wife spoke to the network about his release . `` Now I can think differently , '' Asma Ismailov said . `` Now I can plan my life differently . Everything will be all right , God willing . '' Al-Hajj 's young son , Mohammed , said he would `` kiss his head '' when he sees his father . `` I 'll tell him that I love him and I need him . '' The Sudanese government told Al-Jazeera that al-Hajj faced no charges in Sudan and is a free man . The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj 's release , including one that prevents him from any political activity . Reporters Without Borders , which campaigned for al-Hajj 's release , said in a statement that the cameraman `` never should have been held so long . '' `` U.S. authorities never proved that he had been involved in any kind of criminal activity , '' the worldwide press freedom group said . The organization said al-Hajj was accused of gun-smuggling for al Qaeda and running an Islamist Web site , although no evidence supporting those charges was produced . `` We are delighted that Sami al-Hajj can finally be reunited with his family and friends , '' said Joel Simon , executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists . `` But his detention for six years , without the most basic due process , is a grave injustice and represents a threat to all journalists working in conflict areas .

{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Actor Charlie Sheen checked into a rehab clinic `` as a preventive measure , '' his publicist said Tuesday . Sheen will `` take some time off '' from his acting job on the CBS series `` Two and a Half Men '' while he undergoes rehabilitation , publicist Stan Rosenfield said . In a joint statement , executives from CBS and Warner Bros. . Television and `` Two and a Half Men '' creator\/producer Chuck Lorre said they `` support Charlie Sheen in his decision today to begin voluntary in-patient care at a treatment center . We wish him nothing but the best as he deals with this personal matter . Production on ` Two and a Half Men ' will be temporarily suspended . '' Rosenfield 's short statement did not say what issue Sheen needed to address with rehabilitation or the kind of facility he is entering . The announcement comes a day after a lawyer for Sheen 's wife , Brooke Mueller , confirmed she had switched rehab facilities in her battle with substance abuse . There was no information given about who was caring for the couple 's twin boys . Sheen , 44 , and Mueller , 32 , were involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen , Colorado , on Christmas Day that resulted in a felony assault charge against Sheen . Mueller 's lawyer said Monday that she pulled out of The Canyon , a Malibu , California , rehab center , over the weekend after a `` major breach of her privacy . '' She immediately checked into `` a private , secure facility '' to continue her substance-abuse rehabilitation so she can be `` the best mother '' to her children , attorney Yale Galanter said . Galanter said he was planning a lawsuit against the rehab center after confidential details of Mueller 's treatment there were given to journalists over the weekend . `` I am going to make them pay like you ca n't believe for screwing over my client , '' Galanter said . `` You can quote me on that . '' A call to The Canyon by CNN was not immediately returned . Mueller voluntarily entered rehab in the wake of the Christmas Day incident with Sheen , Galanter said . Aspen police charged Sheen with felony second-degree assault , felony menacing and a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief . He was booked under his birth name , Carlos Irwin Estevez . Sheen and Mueller married in 2008 . Their twin sons -- Max and Bob -- will have their first birthday in March . Separately , a Los Angeles county social worker visited Sheen 's home Sunday to check on his children , Sheen 's publicist said . `` The visit from -LSB- the department of children and family services -RSB- was routine and procedural , '' Rosenfield said . Los Angeles County was asked by Pitkin County , Colorado , child protection officials to check on the family as part of a follow-up to Sheen 's arrest in Aspen , Rosenfield said . Agency officials declined to confirm or comment on the visit because of privacy laws . CBS did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment . Sheen 's history of trouble began in 1990 when he was dating actress Kelly Preston . Reports surfaced then that Preston had been shot in the arm . In 2001 Sheen told Playboy magazine that it was a `` complete accident . I was n't even in the room . She picked up a pair of my pants . ... A little revolver fell out of my back pocket , hit the bathroom floor and went off . It shot a hole through the toilet and she got hit in the leg with shrapnel . '' The couple split soon after the incident and Preston married actor John Travolta in 1991 . In 1994 Sheen was the only celebrity client whose name was publicly released during the trial of `` Hollywood Madam '' Heidi Fleiss . In 1996 , adult film actress Brittany Ashland accused Sheen of throwing her on the floor and splitting her lip . Sheen pleaded no contest to battery charges and was fined $ 2,800 . He entered rehab in 1998 after an alleged drug overdose . During the course of his divorce from model-turned-actress Denise Richards in 2006 , Richards filed a restraining order against Sheen , saying he tried to kill her . Sheen released a statement at the time saying : `` Obviously , what has taken place is vile , is unconscionable , is without merit , is a transparent and immature smear campaign . She 's claiming certain things . It 's baseless . '' CNN 's Alan Duke , Brittany Kaplan , Marc Balinsky and journalist Jo Piazza contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health officials on Friday reported a slight decrease in H1N1 flu activity nationwide . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 43 states now have widespread flu activity , compared with 46 states last week and 48 states at the beginning of November . `` It 's still much greater than we would ever see at this time of year , '' Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the CDC 's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said in a news conference . Schuchat added that while some parts of the country are seeing a small decline in flu cases , other areas , including Maine and Hawaii , have seen a bit of a surge . It 's too early to know if the worst is over in terms of the flu season , she said . `` Even though we saw a little bit of a decrease this week , it is still higher than the peak activity in many years , '' she said . Flu season does n't usually start until December . But when the H1N1 virus emerged in April , the spread of the flu never stopped , effectively stretching last year 's flu season into the new one . The CDC also said 21 more deaths from H1N1 in children were reported in the past week , bringing the official toll of confirmed pediatric H1N1 deaths in the United States to 171 . Schuchat said the number does n't reflect the true picture . `` We believe the estimates we provided last week give a better picture of the full toll that the virus has taken in the first six months of the pandemic , '' she said . Last week the CDC reported that it estimated 540 children had died from complications of this flu virus so far . In an effort to limit further spread of the virus as millions of Americans begin traveling for the holidays , the CDC has launched a public awareness campaign . Schuchat urged everyone to take simple precautions . `` Travel only when you are well , '' she told reporters . `` Wash your hands often . ... Cover your cough and sneeze with tissues or with your sleeve . ... And get vaccinated against flu , particularly if you 're in a targeted population . '' Watch why Santa wants a flu shot More people will be able to get vaccinated , according to the CDC , because more vaccine continues to be available . States have been able to order a total of 54.1 million doses of H1N1 vaccine so far , Schuchat said . `` That number is 11 million doses more than we were at a week ago . '' In response to a report from Norway that a couple of people died from a mutated form of the H1N1 virus , Schuchat said the CDC is aware that the mutated form had been identified , but that H1N1 vaccine and antiviral medications still are effective against H1N1 . Some cases of H1N1 that show resistance to the antiviral Tamiflu have been identified in North Carolina and Wales . But Schuchat said Tamiflu-resistant influenza viruses have been `` quite rare '' so far . Tamiflu does n't cure the flu , but can reduce symptom severity and duration of illness by about a day if taken within the first day or two of getting sick .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Ginny Bank was 14 when her mother sat her down and said they needed to see a gynecologist . While pregnant with Ginny in the mid-1960s her mom had taken a synthetic estrogen known as diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- , which at the time was prescribed to prevent miscarriages and complications . Later that decade , however , doctors connected the drug to a rare form of vaginal cancer that was turning up in young women exposed to DES in the womb . Bank 's first Pap test came back abnormal . Over the next several decades she endured countless abnormal results , biopsies , and preventive surgeries , but fortunately she never developed cancer . But in her early 30s DES came up in a different context , when she consulted a fertility specialist after trying for several months to get pregnant . `` I was filling out a questionnaire before my appointment , and there it was : ` Did your mother take DES ? ' '' Bank recalls . `` Before then , no one had ever told me I 'd have a problem getting pregnant . '' Health.com : A top doctor reveals 8 fertility misconceptions Cancer , it turns out , is just one of the potential health problems faced by the millions of women like Bank who were exposed to DES in the womb . According to a new government study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine , these so-called DES daughters are at higher-than-normal risk for an array of reproductive complications and other problems , including infertility . Researchers at the National Cancer Institute analyzed data from three separate studies that have followed more than 4,000 DES-exposed women since the 1970s . Compared with a control group of unexposed women , DES daughters were found to have higher rates of infertility -LRB- 33 % versus 16 % -RRB- , miscarriage -LRB- 50 % versus 39 % -RRB- , preterm delivery -LRB- 53 % versus 18 % -RRB- , and ectopic pregnancy -LRB- 15 % versus 3 % -RRB- . The DES-exposed women were also 82 % more likely to develop breast cancer after age 40 , and more than twice as likely to experience menopause before age 45 . For most of the health conditions included in the study , the increase in risk was even greater for DES daughters who had been exposed to especially high doses of the drug . Health.com : 25 breast cancer myths busted `` Investigators tend to just study disease rather than people . But this actually looks at ... the risk for an individual woman who 's been exposed and tells her what exactly it means to her , '' says Robert Hoover , M.D. , the lead author of the study and the director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the NCI , in Bethesda , Maryland . `` When you look at it that way , the numbers are somewhat staggering . '' As many as 10 million people were exposed to DES in the womb between 1938 , when the drug appeared on the market , and 1971 , when the Food and Drug Administration urged doctors to stop prescribing it . -LRB- As if the health fallout were n't reason enough , researchers had also discovered that DES was n't effective at preventing miscarriages . -RRB- Many of the potential health complications identified in the new study have been raised in previous research , in some cases with conflicting results . A 2010 study of DES daughters conducted in the Netherlands , for instance , found no link between exposure and breast-cancer risk . -LRB- Fifty-three DES daughters who developed breast cancer have brought a lawsuit against several DES manufacturers ; the lawsuit is currently under way in Boston . -RRB- Health.com : 5 simple things that could cut your breast cancer risk Researchers ca n't explain the apparent link between DES exposure and health problems , but lab experiments in animals have suggested that the drug may cause harmful cell changes or compromise immune function , the study notes . Despite the long history of DES research , the `` vast majority '' of health professionals working today know very little about the drug , says Candy Tedeschi , a nurse practitioner in Great Neck , N.Y. , who worked for 20 years in a state screening center for DES daughters operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` They either have never heard of it , or they think that it 's long over with -- that the women affected are all dead , '' Tedeschi says . `` Hopefully this -LSB- study -RSB- will have a bigger impact and get doctors looking at some of the risk factors for these women that they were n't already . '' Hoover and his colleagues recommend that doctors and researchers continue to monitor women who were exposed to DES in the womb . Some researchers have also begun to look for abnormal health patterns in the daughters of DES daughters , a group known as the DES granddaughters . Health.com : Can pregnancy predict your risk of breast cancer ? Bank , now 47 , does n't have to worry about passing any DES-related problems on to a daughter . Tests conducted in her early 30s showed that she had the hormone levels and reproductive system of a 45-year-old , as well as a very small uterus . -LRB- Like most DES-exposed women , Bank ca n't conclusively prove DES directly caused these abnormalities . -RRB- After an unsuccessful round of in vitro fertilization , Bank sought solace in an online advocacy and support group , DES Action , and a year later adopted a baby boy . Her experience has made her `` very wary '' of prescription drugs and dietary supplements that have n't been well-researched , even though she works as a consultant for the dietary-supplement industry in Boulder , Colorado . `` I do n't know what I 'm going to do when I get to menopause and have hot flashes , because I certainly do n't want to take hormones , '' she says . Health.com : Can supplements ease menopause symptoms ? For his part , Hoover says the new study reiterates the importance of continuing to make clinical research safer and more thorough in the future . `` If it was n't for this small group of women with this bizarre cancer back in the '60s , we would n't know anything about what turned out to be a major public-health disaster , '' he says . `` It 's a wake-up call for us to wonder how many other drugs might be out there that are also causing all sorts of adverse health effects .

{"answer":"Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli government ministers Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a temporary freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank in an effort to restart peace talks with the Palestinians . The Security Cabinet voted 11-2 in favor of the measure which calls for a 10-month freeze on new building permits and the construction of new residential buildings in the West Bank . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it `` a very big step toward peace '' and said he hoped the Palestinians would `` take full advantage '' of the opportunity to restart talks during the 10-month window . `` I hope the Palestinians and the Arab world will work with us to forge a new beginning ... for our children and for theirs , '' he said . In Washington , the top U.S. envoy for the region , George Mitchell , said he hoped to use the time to begin negotiations on permanent status issues , which include security for Israelis and Palestinians , borders , refugees and the status of Jerusalem . `` My personal and fervent wish is that we will , during this process at some point , have a resolution of borders so there will no longer be any question about settlement construction , '' Mitchell told reporters . `` It falls short of a full settlement freeze , but it is more than any Israeli government has done before , and can help move toward agreement between the parties , '' Mitchell told a briefing at the State Department . He said he plans to return soon to the region . Mitchell shrugged off a suggestion he might be discouraged after more than 10 months of failing to relaunch peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians . `` You ca n't take as final the first ` no , ' the second ` no ' or even the hundredth ` no , ' '' said Mitchell , who helped negotiate a peace agreement in Northern Ireland and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom . `` You ca n't get discouraged by setbacks and you ca n't be deterred by criticism . You have to be patient , persevering and determined . '' Mitchell also released a statement from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , which said the announcement helps move the issue forward . `` We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines , with agreed swaps , and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet Israeli security requirements , '' the Clinton statement said . `` Let me say to all the people of the region and world : our commitment to achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering , '' the Clinton statement added . Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , a representative of the Middle East Diplomatic Quartet made up of the European Union , the United States , the Russian Federation and the United Nations , called the announcement `` an important step towards creating the possibility for serious and credible negotiations for a two-state solution . `` The key , as I have said consistently , is to combine a credible political negotiation with real change on the ground , in institution-building , security performance and economic development , '' Blair said . But Danny Danon , a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu 's Likud Party and chairman of the Settlers Council , opposed the announcement . `` If the prime minister will implement the ideology of the left , he will not get the support of his own party , '' he said . `` All the things he wrote in his books , said in his speeches , he so eloquently preached for , he does exactly the opposite , '' said Danon , calling the move a `` disappointment . '' Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said the proposed temporary freeze would be inadequate : `` The exclusion of Jerusalem is a very serious problem for us , '' he told reporters on Wednesday . Palestinian officials , including Fayyad , have called on Israel to freeze construction in Jerusalem as well . The Palestinians want Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state . In recent weeks , Netanyahu and other members of his cabinet have made clear that a construction freeze would not be implemented in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem . Israel views Jerusalem as a separate issue to be hammered out in final status talks with the Palestinians . The measure would not affect buildings already under construction for the existing Jewish residents in the West Bank , Netanyahu said . Construction of public building would also continue , government officials have said . The Israeli government is under tremendous pressure -- particularly from its ally , the United States -- to halt settlement construction in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank . Continued construction has been a key stumbling block in restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks . The Israeli Security Cabinet is a subset of the larger Israeli Cabinet . It has historically been used by prime ministers to approve quick action on defense and diplomatic matters . CNN 's Michael Zippori and Kevin Flower contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes . Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over allaged war crimes in Darfur . Al-Bashir landed in Qatar on Sunday and met with Qatar 's emir , Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani . On Monday , he expressed his gratitude to the Arab League Summit . `` We appreciate your support for Sudan in many areas , '' al-Bashir said . `` This support will , God willing , lead to issuing clear and unequivocal decisions -- rejecting the decision -LSB- the ICC arrest warrant -RSB- . '' U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also attended the meeting but avoided any confrontation with al-Bashir . The U.N. leader focused instead on efforts to have humanitarian aid workers allowed back into Sudan . Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant . The March 4 arrest warrant is the first issued for a sitting head of state by the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal , based at The Hague in the Netherlands . But the ICC has no arrest powers and depends on its 106 member states to take suspects into custody . Qatar , site of the summit , is not a member of the tribunal . Sudan refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC , and has made no efforts to hand over two other officials indicted by the court . Al-Bashir has called the charges an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan . The International Criminal Court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government 's campaign against rebels in Darfur , in western Sudan . The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict . Qatar had been mediating talks between Sudanese officials and representatives of one of the rebel factions , who signed a confidence-building agreement in February . At the State Department , deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur . `` We would hope that while -LSB- al-Bashir -RSB- is in Doha that the Arab League would focus on the immediate and urgent needs of the people on the ground in Sudan and address the humanitarian situation in Darfur and meet the priorities of the comprehensive peace agreement , '' he said . `` The discussions should be on how to stop the violence and support the people . `` The presence of Bashir at this conference should be used as an opportunity to bring forth the international concern to what is happening in Darfur and southern Sudan .

The king of kings in Africa . The imam to Muslims . My international position does not allow me to be reduced . Thank you . '' State Department spokesman Duguid declined to comment .

In the books -- which also included 1971 's `` Rabbit Redux '' and a 2001 novella , `` Rabbit Remembered '' -- onetime basketball star Harry `` Rabbit '' Angstrom negotiates marriage , divorce , wealth and health problems , never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life . `` Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection , but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood , and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman in naming `` Rabbit , Run '' to Time 's `` All-Time 100 Novels '' list . Updike was incredibly prolific , penning essays , reviews , short stories , poetry and memoirs . His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker , including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams ' final game , `` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu . '' `` No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John , '' said David Remnick , the editor of the magazine , in a statement . `` Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine , loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young . `` We adored him , '' Remnick continued . `` He was , for so long , the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him . '' The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years , including 327 book reviews , 170 short stories and 154 poems . He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts . `` John Updike 's place among America 's literary greats is forever secure , as is his special place in every Red Sox fan 's heart for his magnificent ` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu , ' '' Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D-Massachusetts -RRB- said in a statement . `` We honor his memory and his contributions , and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own . '' Updike never won a Nobel Prize , but one of his characters , Henry Bech , received one in `` Bech at Bay '' -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . His works , particularly given their sexual content , could be as divisive as they were poetic . Many critics accused him of misogyny , and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream . `` It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book , '' the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001 . But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers , the cover of Time magazine -LRB- for 1968 's `` Couples '' -RRB- and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain 's Literary Review . He was criticized by Norman Mailer , hailed by fellow author -LRB- and Updike obsessive -RRB- Nicholson Baker in `` U and I '' and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a `` Simpsons '' episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book . '' -LSB- I -RSB- was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield , '' Updike said , noting that the hardest part of his performance was `` producing a chuckle . '' John Hoyer Updike was born March 18 , 1932 , in Reading , Pennsylvania , and grew up in Shillington . From an early age he took to reading and writing , and earned a full scholarship to Harvard , where he headed the Harvard Lampoon . Upon graduation , he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England . By the time he was 23 , he had been offered a position at The New Yorker , which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years . Updike 's first novel , `` The Poorhouse Fair , '' came out in 1959 . The next year , in `` Rabbit , Run , '' he introduced Angstrom , who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction . When introduced , Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife , the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life . Over the course of the `` Rabbit '' books , the character would routinely infuriate his spouse , mistresses and offspring , try to make things right , and never quite succeed . His attitude did n't help . `` Men are all heart and women are all body . I do n't know who has the brains . God maybe , '' the character said in `` Rabbit , Run . '' `` Rabbit , Run '' was successful , as were Updike 's other '60s books , including `` The Centaur '' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- , which featured a teacher much like Updike 's father , and the short story collection `` The Music School '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . But it was `` Couples '' that made Updike a household name . The book , about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts , became a No. 1 best-seller . Updike 's interests ranged widely . He wrote about an African state in `` The Coup '' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- . He discussed the relationship between science and religion in `` Roger 's Version '' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . He revisited `` Hamlet '' in `` Gertrude and Claudius '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . And he created a group of promiscuous witches in `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil . Though Updike 's work routinely sold well , he was painfully aware of the decline of what 's come to be called `` literary fiction . '' In a 2000 interview with Salon , he lamented its difficulties . `` When I was a boy , the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher 's shelf . I mean , Steinbeck , Hemingway , some Faulkner . Faulkner actually had , considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are , quite a middle-class readership , '' he said . `` But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent . You do n't feel that now . '' And yet , Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word , and the pleasure brought by jotting , tuning , refining -- creating -- a new story , even as the years drifted by . `` An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that , as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them , will outlast him for a while , '' he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year . `` The pleasures , for him , of book-making ... remain , and retain creation 's giddy bliss . Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best . '' Updike 's most recent novel , `` The Widows of Eastwick , '' came out in 2008 . A collection of stories , `` My Father 's Tears and Other Stories , '' is due out later this year .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge on Thursday denied a request for President Barack Obama to testify at a court martial for a U.S. Army flight surgeon who refused to deploy to Afghanistan until he saw proof that Obama was born in the United States . The judge , Army Col. Denise Lind , said any evidence or witnesses related to Obama 's citizenship is irrelevant to the charges against Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin , who has 17 years of service in the U.S. military . After failing to deploy with his unit in April , Lakin was charged with missing a movement , disobeying a lawful order and dereliction of duty . The Uniform Code of Military Justice says the maximum punishment for both offenses -- missing his plane and disobeying lawful orders -- is a dishonorable discharge and up to two years in confinement . A guilty verdict could also result in forfeiture of Lakin 's pay , which totals $ 7,959 a month , according to a charge sheet provided by a group sponsoring his defense . Lakin 's lawyers argued that all military orders stem from the commander-in-chief . Without evidence that Obama is eligible to be president , they say , the doctor 's deployment order was illegal . In addition to putting Obama on their witness list , Lakin 's lawyers had asked Lind to order Obama 's official birth records from Hawaii be brought to court for trial . `` If the president is ineligible , you need to know that , '' Lakin 's civilian attorney , Paul Jensen , told Lind . `` Col. Lakin needs to know that , the government needs to know that , America needs to know that . '' The prosecutors in the case argued that Obama 's eligibility is not relevant because the officers who ordered Lakin to go to Fort Campbell and then ordered him to answer questions about why he did n't go were his proper superiors in the military chain of command , and they gave him legal orders . Jensen later conceded that point . The judge ruled that the matter of Obama 's eligibility is not relevant because he did not give any orders in the case . She pointed out that while the president is commander-in-chief of the military , it is Congress that is constitutionally empowered to raise armies , pay them and equip them . Any contention that any orders are invalid if the president is ineligible `` is erroneous , '' the judge said . Lind also said that military law says that a soldier 's personal beliefs or convictions are not sufficient to allow that soldier to determine that an order is illegal . The soldier has to have `` no rational doubt '' that the order is illegal before he or she can ignore it . Finally she ruled that a military court martial is not the forum in which to determine a president 's eligibility , because the Constitution says only Congress has the power to impeach and remove the president . Afterward , Jensen said he respected the judge 's ruling , but called it distressing . `` It completely deprives us of any opportunity to present a defense in this case , '' Jensen said . The court martial is set to begin in October , but Jensen said he 's not giving up on the matter of Obama 's eligibility . `` We will be giving the Army Court of Criminal Appeals in the next week or two the opportunity to take up the issue , and we are going to fight on for justice to be served in this case . '' Lakin is among 27 percent of Americans who doubt or deny that Obama is American-born , according to a recent CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll . They compose the birther movement , which demands that Obama present a birth certificate signed by the doctor who delivered him in 1961 . CNN and other news organizations have thoroughly debunked the rumors about the president 's birthplace . The Obama campaign released a copy of a birth record issued by the state in 2007 , called a `` certification of live birth , '' and allowed reporters to examine the document in person in 2008 . Last year , Hawaiian state officials issued a statement that they had personally viewed the president 's original Hawaiian birth record , called a `` certificate of live birth , '' and verified it to be authentic . State law bars the release of the original certificate . In addition , two Hawaiian newspapers ran notices in 1961 announcing Obama 's birth in the state .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The widow of an Internal Revenue Service employee killed when a disgruntled taxpayer flew his plane into a seven-story building in Austin , Texas , last week is suing the pilot 's wife , according to court documents . Valerie Hunter , the wife of Vernon Hunter , is accusing Sheryl Stack , wife of Andrew Joseph `` Joe '' Stack III , of negligence , alleging she knew or should have known that her husband was a threat to others and , thus , could have prevented the attack , according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Travis County District Court . `` Stack was threatened enough by Joseph Stack that she took her daughter and stayed at a hotel the night before the plane crash . -LSB- She -RSB- owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to others including -LSB- Vernon Hunter -RSB- , '' the suit says . The lawsuit also seeks to bar the release of Vernon Hunter 's autopsy report , saying that , if made public , it would cause Hunter 's family to suffer `` severe and irreparable emotional distress . '' Hunter was killed February 18 when , authorities say , Stack flew his Piper Cherokee PA-28 into a northwest Austin building that housed nearly 200 IRS employees . Authorities say Stack set fire to his $ 230,000 home in Austin before embarking on his fatal flight . Police have said Sheryl Stack spent the previous night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why . Police said they had received no calls of domestic violence from the house . The only calls to police were made a couple of years ago and concerned barking dogs , officials said said . A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government , particularly the IRS . `` I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different , '' the online message said . `` I am finally ready to stop this insanity . Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let 's try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They share a deep sorrow : an idealistic American who tried to protect the Kurds of Iraq , a Canadian general who refused to follow orders in Rwanda , a French priest who fought for the soul of Cambodia . CNN 's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe , Africa and Asia for `` Scream Bloody Murder . '' Each one tried to focus the world 's attention on the world 's most heinous crime : genocide . Each time , they were shunned , ignored or told it was someone else 's problem . To understand why , CNN 's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe , Africa and Asia for a two-hour documentary , `` Scream Bloody Murder . '' Having reported on mass atrocities around the world , this time Amanpour traced the personal accounts of those who tried to stop the slaughter . The yearlong CNN investigation found that instead of using a U.N. treaty outlawing genocide as a springboard to action , political leaders have invoked reason after reason to make intervention seem unnecessary , pointless and even counter-productive . Map : See the locations featured in the documentary '' December marks the 60th anniversary of the U.N.

Read the 1948 Genocide Convention -LRB- pdf -RRB- `` The Genocide Convention should have stopped genocide , but it did n't , '' said Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel . Intervention is a daunting challenge , he believes , because of a tendency to minimize accounts from refugees and victims . `` It 's better not to believe , because if you believe , you do n't sleep nights . And how can you eat ? How can you drink a glass of wine when you know ? '' See images from locations in the documentary '' 1970s : Cambodia Father Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud was a Catholic missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge guerillas -- communist revolutionaries -- seized power in 1975 . They expelled all foreigners from the country . But working from France , Ponchaud gathered refugee accounts and monitored radio broadcasts to document the slave labor , torture and executions the Khmer Rouge were using to kill one-fourth of Cambodia 's population . He published his findings in a major French newspaper and wrote a book , `` Year Zero . '' But even so , Ponchaud tells Amanpour , `` No one believed us . '' Watch a behind-the-scenes look at the making of ` Scream Bloody Murder ' '' 1980s : Iraq CNN found that intervention is often weighed against political and economic costs . Declassified U.S. government documents show that while Saddam Hussein was gassing Iraqi Kurds , the U.S. opposed punishing Iraq with a trade embargo because it was cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. farm exports . According to Peter Galbraith , then an idealistic Senate staffer determined to stop Hussein from committing genocide , the Reagan administration `` got carried away with their own propaganda . They began to believe that Saddam Hussein could be a reliable partner . '' Read once-secret U.S. documents 1990s : Bosnia Even extensive news coverage may not lead to intervention . During the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s , the media reported on the Bosnian Serbs ' ethnic cleansing of Muslims : the siege of Sarajevo , the concentration camps , the use of rape as a weapon of war . It was like watching `` a color remake of the black-and-white scenes we 'd seen in World War II , '' said U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke , whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power . Holbrooke was an early advocate for a U.S.-led military operation against the Bosnian Serbs . `` I took a stand that I believed was correct , '' he told Amanpour . `` I did n't think it was so controversial . '' But it would take three years -- and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica -- for Holbrooke to make his case within the Clinton administration . 1994 : Rwanda In Rwanda , where Hutu soldiers and militias massacred their Tutsi countrymen , the Clinton administration tried to avoid characterizing the ethnic slaughter as genocide . According to an internal memo , the State Department worried that under the 1948 Genocide Convention , using the term `` genocide '' could force the U.S. `` to actually ` do something . ' '' The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda , Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire , begged for additional troops . Instead of reinforcements , Dallaire got an order to withdraw completely . He would not leave Rwanda . `` I refused a legal order , '' he told Amanpour , `` but it was immoral . '' His tiny U.N. force was not enough to stop the slaughter of more than 800,000 people . 2003 : Darfur Some human rights advocates consider Darfur , the western region of Sudan , to be the scene of the first genocide of the 21st century . The atrocities in Darfur grow out of a civil war between rebels from Sudan 's African tribes and the country 's Arab-led government . In 2003 , when the rebels attacked government outposts in Darfur , a U.N. human rights monitor warned that in the `` escalating conflict , '' Sudan 's government may be `` engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur . '' At the time , world attention was on Iraq , where the United States was fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein . The early warning on Darfur `` disappeared into a big hole , '' according to Mukesh Kapila , then the U.N. 's top official in Sudan . Even when the U.N. Security Council put Darfur on its agenda , it took more than three years to authorize a robust peacekeeping force . `` There was no lack of information , '' says activist Eric Reeves . `` There was a lack of will to stop genocide .

{"answer":"COLOMBO , Sri Lanka -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Angered by what he perceived as the systemic discrimination of the minority Tamils by successive Sri Lankan governments , 18-year-old Velupillai Prabhakaran , armed with just a revolver , set out in 1972 to right the perceived wrongs by forming a militant group . Sri Lanka 's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft . That group eventually morphed into the Tamil Tigers , who have engaged in a brutal 25-year insurgency for an independent Tamil state that has left more than 70,000 dead . Along the way , the group has been declared a terrorist organization in 32 countries , pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and , according to the FBI , invented the suicide belt . It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so . Over the weekend , the militants offered to `` silence '' their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks , usurping them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country , and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land . Watch more on the possible end to the conflict '' On Monday afternoon , the Sri Lankan government said it had killed Prabhakaran . If the rebels now follow through on their announcement , the action will potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia . Who are the Tamils ? The Tamils are an ethnic group that makes up about 12 percent of Sri Lanka 's population of about 20 million . They mostly dominate the northern and eastern part of the country . Tamils are mostly Hindu and speak Tamil . That sets them apart from Sri Lanka 's majority group , the Sinhalese , who make up 74 percent of the population . They are Buddhists and speak Sinhala . The tension between the two ethnic groups date to the British colonization of the country -- an island in the Indian Ocean , south of India . At the time , the country was known as Ceylon . Many Sri Lankans regarded the Tamils as British collaborators and resented the preferential treatment they received . The tables turned when the country achieved independence in 1948 and the Sinhalese majority dominated government . It was the Tamils then who claimed they were being discriminated against in politics , employment and education . By the 1970s Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state . It would be called Tamil Eelam . In this climate Prabhakaran emerged with his militant group , formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . Who is Prabhakaran ? Prabhakaran operated from a secret jungle base in the northeastern part of the country , granting few media interviews and remaining an elusive figure to even many Tigers . He was reputed to wear a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow rather than risk capture . And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops . As a result , few Tigers have been captured alive . To Prabhakaran 's supporters he was a hero fighting for the rights of his people . The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with disregard for civilian casualties . He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime . In 1975 , three years after forming his group , Prabhakaran was accused of fatally shooting the mayor of Jaffna , his birthplace . Prabhakaran was also accused of masterminding the killing of then-Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu . Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi 's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka . Two years later , a Tigers ' suicide bomber , allegedly acting under Prabhakaran 's orders , detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka 's then-president , Ranasinghe Premadasa , during a rally . Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka '' Who are the Tamil Tigers ? The Tigers reportedly number about 10,000 , recruited from villagers in Tamil-dominated areas and unemployed Tamil youths who think they were passed over for jobs because of their ethnicity . Their armed struggle began in July 1983 when the Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers . It led to , what was until then , the largest outburst of violence in the island 's history . Hundreds of Tamils were killed , thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fled to south India . Despite being vastly outnumbered , the Tigers have -- until now -- shown no signs of being overpowered by the Sri Lankan military . The Tigers are infamous for suicide bombings , with men and women strapping on suicide vests for more than 200 attacks against Sri Lankan citizens and dozens of high-profile political leaders . In addition to perpetrating the attacks that killed Gandhi and Premadasa , the rebels have carried out the assassinations of two lawmakers and four ministers . A suicide bomber targeted Sri Lankan then-President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 while she was campaigning for re-election . She was wounded but survived . The Tigers , however , have refrained from targeting Western tourists out of fear that foreign governments would crack down on Tamil expatriates who raise money for them abroad , the U.S. State Department said . Have there been peace talks ? Periodically fighting has briefly halted because of a handful of peace agreements . By February 2002 the Tigers had dropped their demands for a separate homeland in exchange for a power-sharing deal with the government . Norway and some other countries agreed to monitor the ceasefire . A year later the rebels dropped out of the negotiations , saying they were being marginalized . They launched a suicide bombing campaign soon after . What led to renewed fighting ? In January 2008 the Sri Lankan government announced it was annulling the nearly six-year-old truce with the rebels , declaring that it would crush the rebels . The fighting intensified with security forces driving the rebels from their strongholds in the east and north of the country . The government asked the rebels to lay down arms ; the rebels vowed to continue . Caught in the crossfire were civilians , thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed . International aid groups expressed concern that both the government and the rebels disregarded civilian safety even in no-fire zones and hospitals . Both sides blamed the other for civilian casualties and exaggerated accounts of their victories . With journalists not allowed into the battle zones , their claims could not be independently confirmed . On Sunday , the Tigers posted an `` urgent statement '' on a pro-rebel Web site , saying the battle had reached `` its bitter end . '' `` We have decided to silence our guns , '' the statement said . Euphoria gripped the war-wracked nation . And Sri Lanka 's President Mahinda Rajapaksa readied to announce to Tuesday that military operations had ended . But one last order of business awaited : The capture , dead or alive , of Prabhakaran . In the past , the Tigers have emerged from near-defeat . But if Prabhakaran 's death is confirmed , the government is optimistic that it can write off the Tigers .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly seven years after the remains of federal intern Chandra Levy were found in a Washington park , a jailed laborer from El Salvador faces a murder charge in her death , authorities said Tuesday . Ingmar Guandique is serving a 10-year sentence for two assaults in the park where Levy 's body was found . A judge on Tuesday signed an arrest warrant for Ingmar Guandique , 27 , who is serving a 10-year sentence for two assaults in Rock Creek Park that occurred around the time of Levy 's disappearance . Her remains were found in Rock Creek Park about a year after she was reported missing . `` We believe Levy was a random victim of Guandique , who attacked and killed her as she jogged in Rock Creek Park , '' said Jeffrey Taylor , U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia . Guandique 's public defenders said the case was far from over , and urged the public not to jump to conclusions . `` This flawed investigation , characterized by the many mistakes and missteps of the Metropolitan Police Department and every federal agency that has attempted to solve this case , will not end with the simple issuance of an arrest warrant against Mr. Guandique , '' the federal public defender 's office said in a statement ... We look forward to trying this case before unbiased jurors who will not rush to judgment . '' Guandique faces a first-degree murder charge . A conviction on the charge would bring a mandatory sentence of 30 to 60 years in prison , Taylor said . The massive publicity surrounding the Levy case was largely a result of her romantic affair to then-Rep . Gary Condit , a California Democrat . Police questioned Condit many times in connection with the slaying , but the congressman was never considered a suspect . Watch the police announce arrest '' A California native working as an intern for the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Levy , 24 , disappeared May 1 , 2001 . Her remains were found in May 2002 by a man walking his dog in a remote area of the park . Guandique has been imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution-Victorville , a medium-security facility northeast of Los Angeles , California . Officials hope to transfer him from California to the nation 's capital in 45 to 60 days . He 's serving his sentence on the two assault convictions in California because there are no prisons in the District of Columbia . Those convicted of federal crimes in the capital are sent to various federal prisons across the country . Guandique was considered a person of interest in 2002 in connection with Levy 's death , authorities said Tuesday . Before the new charges , his projected release date from prison was October 5 , 2011 . According to officials at Tuesday 's news conference -- and the affidavit supporting the arrest warrant for Guandique -- circumstantial evidence played a large role in the case . Authorities presented no evidence Tuesday of anyone seeing Guandique and Levy together . Timeline of Levy 's disappearance '' But the affidavit said a witness reported seeing and running from a man in the park , and she said she believed that occurred on the same day as Levy disappeared . Upon seeing a photograph of Guandique in the interim , the woman thought he looked like the man who followed her in the park , the affidavit said . Another witness reported seeing Guandique with `` a fat lip and scratches on his face '' about the time of Levy 's disappearance , the affidavit said . The witness added that Guandique said he was injured by his girlfriend during an argument . Interviewed by police , Guandique 's girlfriend at the time said that while he was violent with her on occasion , `` at no time during any of the arguments or fights did -LSB- she -RSB- ever strike Guandique or cause any injuries to his face or neck . '' Two other witnesses reported that Guandique told them he committed crimes against women , including rape and murder , according to the affidavit . And another witness last month told police Guandique admitted his involvement in Levy 's killing , as well as that he tried to rape two other women in the park at knifepoint , the affidavit said . When news emerged last month that Guandique 's arrest was imminent in the Levy case , the same witness told police Guandique `` became very anxious and said something to the effect of , ' -LSB- Expletive -RSB- , it 's over . They got me now . What am I gon na do ? ' '' Authorities searching Guandique 's cell in California in September found a photograph of Levy that apparently had been taken from a magazine , the affidavit said . Speaking last month as news emerged that an arrest in the case was imminent , Levy 's mother , Susan , said , `` It 's a bittersweet situation for me as the mother of a daughter who is no longer here . I want justice . I want to know that the person who did it is in jail and will not do it to anybody else . '' She added , `` Every day the elephant is there . Every day you get a knot in your stomach . It does n't go away . It 's a life sentence for the families and relatives that miss their loved ones . We have a life sentence of hurt .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The presidents of Sudan and Chad signed a non-aggression agreement late Thursday , aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two African nations . Chad President Idriss Deby , right , and Sudan 's President Omar al-Beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar , Senegal , between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby , the president of Chad . Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq . Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . The rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad . They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena , the capital of Chad , in early February . As recently as Thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border . Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby 's regime . The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region . Kingsley Amaning , the U.N. 's humanitarian coordinator for Chad , said more than 10,000 people from Darfur , in Sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad . They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there . The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , Kingsley said .

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik arrived at the federal prison in Cumberland , Maryland , Monday to begin a 48-month prison sentence , prison authorities said . Kerik reported to the medium-security facility , which houses some 500 inmates , at approximately 1 p.m. ET , authorities said . Kerik -- nominated by President George Bush in 2004 to be homeland security adviser , only to later withdraw from consideration -- was sentenced to four years in prison last February . He pleaded guilty to charges including lying to Bush administration officials during his 2004 nomination . Ed Ross , a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons , said Kerik will be expected to perform a number of manual jobs including plumbing , landscaping and food service at the prison , which also has a minimum security camp . On the eve of his imprisonment , Kerik maintained his prosecution was unjust , and said he had to prepare his two daughters , ages 7 and 10 , for his departure . `` Words can not express my disappointment in the prosecutors and the judge 's behavior , and his sentence that followed , '' Kerik wrote on his blog Sunday . `` I have repeatedly expressed remorse for what I may have done , however , unlike many , I ca n't remain silent in the face of what I believe has been a gross injustice , which I pray will be remedied by an appellate court . '' He said he made his two daughters watch the movie `` Rocky Balboa '' for the scene in which Sylvester Stallone 's character tells his son that the world can be an unfair place but one has to persevere . `` As I prepare to serve my sentence , I have had to likewise prepare Angelina and Celine , my 7 - and 10-year-old daughters for what is next to come , and had to teach them that there are times when we are put in situations which are beyond our control and that no matter how undeserved , unsought , or unwanted , we must find the strength , courage , and perseverance to carry on and move forward . '' Kerik , 54 , pleaded guilty in November to tax fraud and six other felonies . He has been under house arrest in Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , since then . In court papers , prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was `` any possible concern '' about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating his apartment or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors . Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on various corruption charges , including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York . He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts in November . Kerik was New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 , a tenure that included the September 11 , 2001 , attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people . He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country 's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003 , and President Bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004 . However , Kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status . In 2006 , he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while working as city corrections commissioner . Under his plea agreement , he paid $ 221,000 in fines and avoided jail time . His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who said his endorsement of Kerik had been `` a mistake . '' Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in 2008 , according to court papers released in October . Kerik 's sentence exceeded the 27 - to 33-month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors . `` With great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences , '' said U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson during the sentencing on February 18 . Kerik ended his blog post Sunday , saying : `` Finally , I can only hope that history will judge me based on my 30 years of public service to our great nation , and not by tabloid headlines , my imperfections , or the mistakes that I may have made .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators expanded their search into Texas Monday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma Sunday night . Authorities also are trying to find the dead woman 's estranged husband , the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement . The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo , Oklahoma , late Sunday , the bureau said . Her mother , Tonya Hobbs , 37 , was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night , the bureau said . Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs ' estranged husband , Lester William Hobbs , at his sister 's home , the bureau said . Lester Hobbs , 46 , and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbs ' car , said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her . Lester Hobbs is not Aja 's biological father , police said . Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert , Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said . Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport , Texas , and the alert was issued preemptively , she said . Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night . Authorities did not say how Hobbs died , but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her . The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs , and was parked at his relatives ' home , Richard Goss , agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation 's Lawton , Oklahoma , office , told reporters Monday . Hobbs ' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja , and one of them pried open the door and discovered Tanya Hobbs ' body , he said . Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone , Goss said . The Hobbses were separated , but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile , Goss said . The couple had been together for about five years . A medical examiner was performing an autopsy , the bureau said , and police want to question Lester Hobbs about the death . He and the girl are believed to be traveling in his car , a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW .

{"answer":"Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man who allegedly shot his ex-wife and seven other people to death in the deadliest shooting in Orange County , California , history pleaded not guilty Tuesday , prosecutors said . An Orange County Superior Court judge scheduled an April 24 , 2012 , preliminary hearing for Scott Evans Dekraai , 41 . Dekraai is charged with eight counts of first-degree murder and a felony count of attempted murder in the October 12 shooting at the Salon Meritage hair salon in the small coastal community of Seal Beach , a district attorney 's spokeswoman said . The first-degree murder charges carry the special circumstance of multiple murder . The attempted murder count is for a ninth victim who was wounded . Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty . Dekraai is being held without bond . Dekraai and his ex-wife , Michelle Fournier , 48 , were battling over custody of their 8-year-old son , and the dispute was the motive in the shooting , Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in October . The prosecutor called Dekraai `` a methodical and merciless killer . '' On the morning of the shooting , Dekraai and Fournier got into an argument about child custody , authorities said . `` We 're sort of guessing . We believe that the custody battle was n't going well for him . We do n't know the contents of their conversation or anything , '' Rackauckas said . Hours later , the gunfire rampage at the salon , just blocks from the ocean , unfolded , authorities said . `` He also considered the people who were friends and who worked with his ex-wife were enablers , and he did n't have much use for them either , '' Rackauckas said . The gunman was armed with three weapons -- a 9 mm Springfield , a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum , and a Heckler & Koch .45 -- and was wearing body armor during the shooting rampage , Rackauckas said . He used at least two of those guns , the prosecutor said . Rackauckas summarized the mass shooting , saying Dekraai `` walked through the salon shooting anyone close enough to hit . He stopped to reload during this spree , and he continued gunning people down . He was not satisfied with murdering his intended target , his ex-wife . For almost two minutes , Dekraai shot victim after victim , executing people by shooting them in the head and chest . `` He shot eight people inside the salon . But he was not done . He then walked out of the salon and shot a ninth victim , a male who was sitting nearby in a parked Range Rover . The reason for this rampage : revenge , '' he said . `` We believe that the defendant committed this unimaginable act of violence because he wanted to kill his ex-wife over a custody dispute concerning their 8-year-old son . He was willing to end any life in his path , and he did . Clearly this two-minute murder spree could not have been about loving his son , '' the prosecutor said . While Dekraai allegedly carried out the mass murder , his son was sitting alone in the principal 's office at school , waiting for his mother or father to pick him up , authorities said . `` That little boy is also a victim . He is now left to mourn the murder of his mother and grow up with the knowledge that his father -LRB- allegedly -RRB- committed a mass murder , '' Rackauckas said . `` What sick , twisted fatherly love is this ? '' In addition to Fournier , of Los Alamitos , the people killed were salon employee Victoria Ann Buzzo , 54 , of Laguna Beach ; David Caouette , 64 , of Seal Beach , who was in the vehicle outside the salon ; salon employee Laura Lee Elody , 46 , of Huntington Beach ; salon owner Randy Lee Fannin , 62 , of Murrieta ; salon client Michele Daschbach Fast , 47 , of Seal Beach ; salon client Lucia Bernice Kondas , 65 , of Huntington Beach ; and salon employee Christy Lynn Wilson , 47 , of Lakewood , authorities said . Dekraai allegedly shot Caouette , who was in the parked vehicle , in the head through a closed front passenger side window , authorities said . The ninth victim , Harriet Stretz , 73 , of Los Alamitos was at the salon getting her hair done by her daughter , Laura Elody , who was among the victims . `` We do know that the victims were shot multiple times each , '' Rackauckas said . About 20 people were inside the salon during the shooting , and many of them were `` playing dead , hiding in back rooms , trying to get back behind things , just trying to stay out of his way , '' Rackauckas said . Police arrested Dekraai without incident as he was trying to leave the scene in a vehicle two blocks from the salon , police said . Dekraai was in possession of the three guns and `` a significant amount of ammunition in his truck , '' according to prosecutors . In the past several months , Fournier complained to Seal Beach police about Dekraai picking up their son from school earlier than the court-ordered mandate , Tim Olson of the Seal Beach police said . That matter was forwarded to family court , and Olson said he did n't know of the complaint 's disposition . In 2007 , in Long Beach , Dekraai 's father-in-law applied for a temporary restraining order , but there was no follow-up , Rackauckas said . An online search of Orange County court records shows the couple filed for divorce in 2007 . A child custody evaluator was appointed by the court in April , records show . Fournier said in court papers that Dekraai was mentally unstable , had threatened to kill himself or someone else and `` was almost manic when it comes to demanding absolute right to control our son , '' CNN affiliate KTLA said . The couple was in court the day before the shooting , and a judge had kept custody between them equal , KTLA said . In 1994 , Dekraai filed for bankruptcy , according to court records . The Salon Meritage is located on the Pacific Coast Highway in Seal Beach , which residents describe as a small and `` fairly intimate '' coastal town . `` We have multiple years with zero homicides , so this obviously is an unusual and tragic circumstance , '' Seal Beach police Sgt. Steve Bowles said . The shooting is the deadliest in Orange County history . In 1976 , Edward Charles Allaway shot nine people , killing seven , at California State University Fullerton .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Barack Obama on Monday detailed what his campaign called a four-part `` economic rescue plan '' for the middle class . `` I 'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system , provide relief to families and communities , and help struggling homeowners , '' Obama said at a campaign event in Toledo , Ohio . `` It 's a plan that begins with one word that 's on everyone 's mind , and it 's easy to spell : J-O-B-S . '' Obama 's plan comes as aides to Sen. John McCain said their candidate would likely wait to lay out any further plans until the Treasury issues a report or recommendations on what to do with the bailout . McCain has already unveiled a plan to buy $ 300 billion in troubled mortgages and renegotiate the terms directly with homeowners . On Friday , he endorsed the idea of suspending the current requirement that seniors start drawing down their retirement plans -- IRAs and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s -- once they reach age 70 1\/2 . Obama on Monday proposed a temporary tax credit for firms that create new jobs in the United States over the next two years , and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs and 401 -LRB- k -RRB- s in 2008 and 2009 . The Democratic candidate called for new legislation that would give families the option of withdrawing as much as 15 percent of their retirement savings -- up to a maximum of $ 10,000 -- without facing a tax penalty this year or next . He also called for a temporary lifting of taxes on unemployment insurance benefits . The Illinois senator also proposed a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for homeowners acting in good faith , and a new effort to address the growing credit crisis at the state and local level . Under the Obama plan , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury would provide much the same kind of backing to state and municipal governments as the recent federal bailout did to the commercial credit market . `` We ca n't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now -- who do n't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow ; who do n't know if next week 's paycheck will cover this month 's bills , '' Obama said . `` We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class ... and we need to do it right now . '' The McCain campaign said Obama 's economic rescue plan was a political move that would not provide solutions . `` It is clear that the economy is hurting , that Americans need across-the-board tax relief , and yet Barack Obama has proven unwilling to break with the left-wing of his party and stand up for the American taxpayer , '' spokesman Tucker Bounds said . Fact check : Obama 's tax plan and small businesses `` Interestingly , Barack Obama called -LSB- for -RSB- a moratorium on foreclosures , which is a policy he had previously labeled ` disastrous ' when it was proposed by a political opponent . Proving yet again that Barack Obama 's positions on the issues are tied to elections , not solutions for the American people , '' he said . During the primaries , Obama criticized Sen. Hillary Clinton 's plan , which , unlike his , included a freeze on interest rates . Earlier Monday , McCain delivered a speech that a senior aide predicted would `` begin a turnaround for the campaign . '' On the new tone , the aide said the campaign decided to go `` back to basics '' with McCain on what he can offer . McCain told voters Monday that they should elect him because `` what America needs in this hour is a fighter . '' `` I will fight to take America in a new direction from my first day in office until my last . I 'm not afraid of the fight , I 'm ready for it , '' McCain said at a rally in Virginia Beach , Virginia . Watch what 's going on in battleground Virginia '' `` Let me give you the state of the race today and some straight talk . We have 22 days to go . We 're 6 points down . The national media has written us off , '' McCain said to a sea of boos . CNN 's most recent poll of polls shows Obama leading McCain by 8 percentage points , 50 to 42 percent . `` Sen. Obama is measuring the drapes , and planning with Speaker -LSB- Nancy -RSB- Pelosi and Sen. -LSB- Harry -RSB- Reid to raise taxes , increase spending , take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections , and concede defeat in Iraq . ... But they forgot to let you decide . My friends , we 've got them just where we want them , '' he said . Obama 's campaign dismissed the Arizona senator 's remarks as a `` political speech about where he is in the polls . '' Watch where the election stands '' `` Less than 12 hours after his campaign announced that Sen. McCain would finally have some new ideas on the economy , he decided that it was more important to give a new political speech about where he is in the polls , '' said Obama-Biden communications director Dan Pfeiffer . McCain advisers downplayed weekend reports that the Arizona senator would be unveiling several economic proposals over the final three weeks of the campaign , saying it was likely he would lay out one or two new ideas , but not the swarm that had been rumored . They also downplayed a Sunday suggestion by McCain surrogate Lindsey Graham that a new economic plan rollout might focus on plans to cut taxes on capital gains and dividends , saying that the South Carolina senator had good ideas but that they had not yet been approved by the campaign . CNN 's national poll of polls consists of six surveys : ABC\/Washington Post -LRB- October 8-11 -RRB- , Fox News\/Opinion Dynamics -LRB- October 8-9 -RRB- , Newsweek -LRB- October 8-9 -RRB- , Reuters\/C-SPAN\/Zogby -LRB- October 10-12 -RRB- , Gallup -LRB- October 10-12 -RRB- and Diageo\/Hotline -LRB- October 10-12 -RRB- .

{"answer":"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was in stable condition and recovering from head injuries Friday night after a car wreck that killed his wife , Susan , medical sources told CNN . Tsvangirai and his wife , Susan , were en route to the prime minister 's hometown of Buhera . The crash , on a busy two-lane highway between Tsvangirai 's hometown of Buhera and the capital city of Harare , comes just weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival , President Robert Mugabe . Analysts say the crash is bound to raise suspicion of foul play , with one former U.S. diplomat calling for an outside investigation , saying it is not the first time that a political foe of Mugabe has been killed or injured in a car crash . Members of Tsvangirai 's political party , the Movement for Democratic Change , said Friday that it was too early to tell whether the crash is anything other than an accident . Tsvangirai 's aide and driver also were injured in the head-on collision with a large truck , according to his spokesman , James Maridadi . Movement for Democratic Change spokesman Nelson Chamisa said he spoke to Tsvangirai at the hospital , and the party leader was in `` relatively stable '' condition . An MDC spokesman describes ` critical ' accident '' Sources at The Avenues Clinic in Harare said that Tsvangirai was in stable condition with minor head injuries and that the prime minister was alert and talking . One source said the attending doctor had told him of his wife 's death . Another said that doctors were planning to keep Tsvangirai overnight for observation and that specialists were checking his condition . Tsvangirai , Zimbabwe 's main opposition leader , took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe after a contentious election . Tsvangirai 's MDC reached the power-sharing agreement with Mugabe in September after months of angry dispute that included violence . More than 200 deaths , mainly those of opposition supporters , were reported leading up to and in the aftermath of the election . `` I 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in Zimbabwe involving an opposition figure , '' said Tom McDonald , the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe from 1997 to 2001 . `` President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it 's sort of his M.O. of how they get rid of people they do n't like . '' Watch more on the fatal crash '' McDonald cited the 2001 death of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi , Employment Minister Border Gezi 's death in 1999 and the death last year of Elliot Manyika , a government minister and former regional governor . All three died in car crashes . `` This is several , '' McDonald said . `` So , when I hear that Tsvangirai was in an accident , it gives me pause . '' McDonald , now an attorney with the Washington law firm Baker Hostetler , urged a full investigation by outside authorities . One analyst who studies the region said the collision could `` exacerbate '' the fragile unity government . `` There will undoubtedly be suspicions about the cause of the crash and whether there was foul play involved , '' said Jennifer Cooke , director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . `` At a time when there needs to be confidence-building measures , this incident potentially raises suspicions and undermines the potential for greater cohesion of the government . -LSB- There is -RSB- huge potential for the agreement to be manipulated by Mugabe . '' McDonald , however , was quick to say that traffic accidents are common in Zimbabwe . The highway on which Tsvangirai was traveling is a two-lane road where tractor-trailers are common , vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and drivers often are inexperienced , he said . `` It 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , '' he said . The collision occurred on the Harare-Masvingo Road as Tsvangirai and his wife headed to his hometown of Buhera , south of the capital , Harare , his spokesman said . The couple , who were married in 1978 , have six children , according to the British Broadcasting Corporation . Last month , Susan Tsvangirai told a BBC affiliate that the past decade had been an `` endurance test '' for her husband and his MDC colleagues . `` People went through hell , but they stuck to their ideals to seek change through democratic means , '' she said . `` This was a struggle that we endured with MDC cadres , activists , supporters and peace-loving Zimbabweans . `` To them I say thank you so much for the support they gave the MDC to reach this momentous period . '' A former miner and union organizer , Morgan Tsvangirai first ran for president in 2002 against Mugabe , who has been the country 's leader since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980 . Since then , Tsvangirai has been charged with treason twice and accused of plotting to assassinate Mugabe . Tsvangirai was arrested and allegedly beaten in 2007 . The criminal charges against him were dropped . CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse , Alan Silverleib and Doug Gross contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's office contacted the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan about reports the ambassador warned against sending more U.S. troops to the country , a Karzai spokesman told CNN Thursday . Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over Karzai 's government . One official , who spoke on condition of not being identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables , said the two communications `` expressed concern and reservations about troop increases in Afghanistan '' until more is known about Karzai 's government after his recent re-election . Separately , a senior U.S. official also confirmed the existence of two Eikenberry classified cables . The official said Eikenberry expressed reservations about troop increases because of lingering concerns about Karzai and uncertainties about the government he is going to put in place . The second official also asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables . In Kabul , Eikenberry 's office would not confirm to Karzai 's office the reports about the cables , Karzai spokesman Seyemic Herawi said . Herawi said Karzai will not comment on the reports without more information from the U.S. Embassy . Should more troops be sent to Afghanistan ? Share your thoughts Eikenberry previously expressed worry about corruption in Karzai 's government and its ability to partner with the United States to fight the Taliban . A senior State Department official told CNN that President Obama 's administration has questions about Karzai 's behavior , suggesting it has been inconsistent . Asked for an official response on reports of the cables , the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it does not comment on private messages , but did confirm that there had been correspondence between Eikenberry and the president . In Washington , State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declined to comment Thursday on Eikenberry 's communications . `` We are not going to get into the details of this kind of advice , '' Kelly said . `` This is a privileged channel of communication . They have the right to receive this advice in a confidential way , '' Kelly said . `` Ambassador Eikenberry has been providing this kind of advice and analysis to the president and secretary since he arrived , '' he said . `` The president really deserves the right to be able to gather all of this information from all of the different principals , people involved in the shaping of this policy . '' Earlier , White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said , `` We wo n't discuss classified documents publicly , but , as we have said for months , success in Afghanistan depends on having a true partner in the Afghan government . '' Initial reports of cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times , Washington Post and Los Angeles Times . All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials , without identifying them . The developments came as Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended , and then asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops , a senior administration official told CNN . The war council -- comprising top Cabinet , Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops . The meeting lasted more than two hours , according to the senior administration official . `` The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he 's been presented , '' the senior official said . `` The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended . After years of substantial investments by the American people , governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner . '' In particular , Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government , the official said . Earlier , a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country . The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops ; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops . The combat brigades would be brought in gradually , in three-month intervals , according to the military official . The troops would be spread across the country , mainly focusing in the south and southeast , where much of the fighting is , according to the military official . The option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks , the official added . That is only one option , the senior administration official emphasized . Three other options , the official said , would be `` different mixes , '' or `` different components of it . '' Despite reports to the contrary , Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan , White House officials said . Such reports are `` absolutely false , '' Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . And anyone who suggests otherwise , `` does n't have , in all honesty , the slightest idea what they 're talking about . '' Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan . The letter , signed by 10 Republican committee members , said success in Afghanistan will require enabling local leaders to govern and secure their country without substantial international assistance .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bea Arthur , the actress best known for her roles as television 's `` Maude '' and the sardonic Dorothy on `` The Golden Girls , '' has died of cancer , a family spokesman said Saturday . Bea Arthur , right , with `` Golden Girls '' co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008 . She was 86 . Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles , her family by her side . She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet , he said . No funeral services are currently planned , Watt said , adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers . Arthur 's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear 's `` All in the Family '' as Edith Bunker 's cousin , and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series . In the '70s , `` Maude '' was ahead of the social curve , tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography , race relations and , in an episode titled `` Maude 's Dilemma , '' abortion . That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter -LRB- Bill Macy -RRB- decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child . But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women 's liberation -- a big deal for the shy , Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City . During the Depression , Arthur 's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge , Maryland . By the time she was 12 , Arthur was nearly 5 feet , 10 inches tall , and self-conscious about her height . But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting . Along the way , she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about , but she kept the last name -- Arthur . The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway . Critics delighted in her haughty , serpent-tongued deliveries . Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called `` Once Upon a Tune , '' but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on `` Studio One , '' `` Kraft Television Theatre '' and `` The Sid Caesar Show . '' Arthur drew attention in `` Threepenny Opera '' on Broadway with Lotte Lenya , but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in `` Fiddler on the Roof . '' In 1966 , Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play `` Mame , '' playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role . Eight years later , she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball , but by then she was already well-established as Maude . Arthur left `` Maude '' in 1978 , making television and some film appearances afterward . She starred in a short-lived series , `` Amanda 's , '' in 1983 and then joined the cast of `` The Golden Girls '' in 1985 with Betty White , Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bucking tradition , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bypass Europe and travel to Asia on her maiden voyage overseas , diplomats familiar with the planning said Tuesday . Bill Clinton looks at his wife Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she is sworn in on February 2 . Clinton is expected to visit China , Japan and South Korea on her first trip overseas . The diplomats said she may also add other stops , including one in Southeast Asia . The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton 's schedule was still being finalized . The State Department has not commented on her travel plans . Making Asia Clinton 's first overseas destination illustrates the Obama administration 's desire for a broader partnership with China and its commitment to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue , as well as strengthening ties with Tokyo and Seoul , the diplomats said . The White House said President Barack Obama told Chinese President Hu Jintao in a Friday phone call that he looked forward to `` to early contacts and exchanges between senior officials of our two countries . '' Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month she hoped to make an early trip to Southeast Asia , in particular Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation where Obama spent part of his childhood . Clinton said she wanted to restart Peace Corps programs there , which were suspended in the 1960s . Traditionally U.S. secretaries of state make Europe or the Middle East their first official trip overseas . But given that Vice President Joseph Biden is headed to Europe this week for a security conference in Germany , and special envoy George Mitchell is currently in the Middle East , Clinton is free to break with tradition . However British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and German Foreign Secretary Walter Steinmeier will be Clinton 's first foreign guests to the State Department on Tuesday . Clinton was sworn in as America 's 67th secretary of state on Monday -- for a second time . Watch Clinton being sworn in '' Biden administered the oath to Clinton in a ceremonial star-studded gathering at the State Department , with actor Chevy Chase and designer Oscar de la Renta among those on hand . `` It is an overwhelming honor ... to assume this position , '' Clinton said . `` We have a lot of work to do -LSB- to ensure that -RSB- America 's future can be even brighter than our storied past .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attorneys representing Casey Anthony invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 60 times during a deposition given in a civil suit against her , according to a transcript of the proceedings . In addition , Anthony 's attorney Charles Greene asserted he would also invoke the Fifth Amendment on her behalf if questioning delved into the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter , Caylee . Anthony , who was acquitted in July of murder charges in Caylee 's death , is being sued in civil court by a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez . When Caylee was reported missing in July 2008 -- a month after she was last seen -- Anthony maintained she had been kidnapped by her nanny , Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez . Authorities were never able to find the nanny . But they did find Gonzalez , who claimed she never met Anthony or her daughter . Gonzalez 's attorneys claim , according to questions asked of Anthony in the October 8 deposition , that Gonzalez was questioned by the police in Caylee 's disappearance , was kicked out of her apartment complex , lost her job and that she and her two daughters received death threats as a result of media attention in the case . Anthony herself said little in the deposition , but did acknowledge she was aware she was being sued by Gonzalez . She also said she has not spoken to her brother , Lee , in the past six months , and has not spoken to her parents , George and Cindy Anthony , since October 14 , 2008 . However , Greene did not permit her to answer questions including whether she had ever met Gonzalez ; whether a person named Zenaida was ever a nanny to Caylee ; or whether defense attorney Jose Baez 's assertion during Anthony 's criminal trial , that Zenaida Gonzalez was one of Anthony 's `` imaginary friends , '' was true . She also was not allowed to answer questions about whether she considered herself a good mother to Caylee ; the last day she saw the 2-year-old alive ; and whether she drowned in the Anthonys ' pool in June 2008 , as the defense claimed during Anthony 's criminal trial . Asked why he was invoking Anthony 's right against self-incrimination , Greene said , according to the transcript , `` I need not explain our factual basis other than to tell you that it could tend to incriminate and provide a link in the chain of evidence that could be used against -LRB- Anthony -RRB- . '' Asked by Gonzalez 's attorney John Morgan what pending criminal case that applies to , Greene said , `` We made our objection and that 's all I 'm going to state . '' Morgan told Greene he anticipates a hearing before a judge on a motion to compel Anthony to answer some of these questions . Greene said that taking it to a judge is `` the best thing to do . '' While Anthony was acquitted on murder charges in Caylee 's death , she was convicted on four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child 's disappearance . She was given credit for time already spent behind bars , however , and was released from jail July 17 . She has remained in seclusion since then , although a judge ruled she must serve a year of probation stemming from her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges . The transcript of the deposition notes that Anthony participated via videoconference from `` an undisclosed location . '' `` I hope that you and your counsel understand that we did not ask questions that many people may have wished we did concerning your employment history then or now , where you live , where you stay , '' Morgan told Anthony as questioning wrapped up . '' ... We did this , this deposition , in pursuit of truth and not in pursuit of sensation . '' Anthony has also been ordered to repay more than $ 217,000 to authorities for the costs of investigating Caylee 's disappearance .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran 's supreme leader took verbal jabs at the United States Saturday in his first public reaction since the United States accused Iran of plotting to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeled the allegations `` meaningless and absurd . '' `` They -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- want to isolate Iran , '' Khamenei said over chants of `` down with America '' in a speech before thousands in the western Iranian city of Gilangharb . Also , an Iranian official said claims by the United States that a high-level U.S. diplomat had met Wednesday with an Iranian counterpart over the plot were untrue . `` There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries , and there was not such a contact , '' said Alireza Miryousefi , press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations . The United States had reported having had `` direct contact with Iran '' about the alleged plot . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland disclosed the contact to reporters . A senior administration official told CNN it occurred Wednesday and was initiated by the United States . Two State Department officials said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice met with Mohammad Khazai , Iran 's permanent representative to the United Nations . Ahead of Saturday 's rebuttal of the claims of diplomatic contact , Iranian officials had previously declined to confirm the meeting . U.S. authorities have accused Iran of being involved in a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States , Adel Al-Jubeir , in spring 2012 . The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force , a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard , which formally answers to Khamenei . Manssor Arbabsiar , a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen , and Gholam Shakuri , an Iran-based member of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , are accused of conspiring to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to bomb a restaurant , where the ambassador would have been . Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel , according to officials and an FBI agent 's affidavit . Reza Aslan , a religious scholar and author , told CNN on Saturday that the described plot `` just does not fit the Quds Force 's M.O. -LRB- modus operandi -RRB- . '' Using a drug cartel would be risky and a Quds Force agent would be more reliable than Arbabsiar , a used-car salesman in Texas , he said . `` It 's sloppy . It 's uncharacteristic , '' said Aslan . `` It really does not serve Iran 's interest in any legitimate way . '' Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East , Africa and elsewhere , Aslan said . `` Doing so on U.S. soil is unmistakably an attack on the United States , not on Saudi Arabia .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the U.N. Children 's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge 's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man . UNICEF 's Ann Veneman said consent can not be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision . `` Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework , the marriage of a child is a violation of that child 's rights , '' said Ann Veneman , executive director of UNICEF . `` The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Consent can not be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision . '' The most recent ruling , in which the judge upheld his original verdict , was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza , where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl 's mother , seeking a divorce for her daughter . Have your say by clicking here A relative said the judge , Sheikh Habib al-Habib , `` stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty . '' The family member , who requested anonymity , added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter . The case , which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups , came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality . The judge ruled that the girl 's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , Abdullah al-Jutaili , the mother 's attorney , told CNN at the time . The girl 's father , according to the lawyer , arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man , who is a close friend of his . At the time of the initial verdict , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , al-Jutaili told CNN . The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty , she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court , the lawyer said . Last month , an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting al-Habib 's verdict , and sent the case back to him for reconsideration . Under the complicated Saudi legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect , but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing . The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month , according to the relative . The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently . While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. . `` It is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , '' Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in remarks last January , according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper . `` A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married . Those who think she 's too young are wrong , and they are being unfair to her . '' Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry . `` We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , '' he said , according to the newspaper . `` We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women . '' Sharia law is Islamic law . Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism . CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment . Christoph Wilcke , a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch , told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages . `` We 've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men , '' Wilcke said . Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children , `` It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts , and in many realms beyond the court . '' In December , Zuhair al-Harithi , a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission , said his organization is fighting against child marriages . `` The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia , '' al-Harithi said . `` Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed . '' He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place . Wajeha al-Huwaider , co-founder of the Society of Defending Women 's Rights in Saudi Arabia , told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to `` keep us backward and in the dark ages . '' She said the marriages cause girls to `` lose their sense of security and safety . Also , it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured . It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jupiter is sporting a new scar after an unseen object hit the gaseous planet this week , NASA scientists say . This NASA image shows a large impact near Jupiter 's southern pole . An amateur astronomer in Australia noticed the new mark -- seen through telescopes as a dark spot -- on the planet early Monday and tipped off scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory -LRB- JPL -RRB- in Pasadena , California , who then confirmed it was the result of a new impact , NASA said . It 's not clear what the object was that crashed into Jupiter 's poisonous atmosphere . Glenn Orton , a JPL scientist , told the magazine New Scientist that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in Jupiter 's neighborhood , or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to have detected before impact . The object created a mark on Jupiter that has the about same diameter as Earth , though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across , said Anthony Wesley , the amateur astronomer who first noticed the scar . The mystery object was likely moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers -LRB- 31 to 62 miles -RRB- per second when it struck near Jupiter 's south pole , Wesley told CNN . `` That generates an unbelievable amount of energy when it collides with pretty much anything , but especially with something the size of Jupiter , '' he said . It is only the second time scientists have been able to observe the results of such an impact on Jupiter . The first happened 15 years ago , when comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into 21 pieces and hit the planet 's atmosphere . `` Given the rarity of these events , it 's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations , '' JPL astronomer Leigh Fletcher said in a NASA interview . Thermal images taken by NASA show the scar as a bright spot , which means the crash warmed the lower atmosphere in that area , New Scientist said . Researchers also found hints of higher-than-normal amounts of ammonia in the upper atmosphere . The Shoemaker-Levy comet also churned up extra ammonia , the magazine said . Jupiter 's new spot is n't likely to last long -- probably just one to two weeks , Wesley said . He pointed out the impact scars from the Shoemaker-Levy debris lasted only two to three weeks before disappearing . Seeing an Earth-sized spot appear so tiny on Jupiter 's surface led to some to wonder Tuesday whether our planet might be in danger of a similar collision . But Wesley said that should n't be a concern because Jupiter functions almost like a celestial vacuum cleaner , sucking up any objects that would be of danger to Earth and its neighbors . `` Jupiter is doing a very good job in scooping up a lot of this material that 's still floating around in the solar system , '' he said . `` It 's just got so much gravity as it swings around the outer part of the solar system , it can really pull in and swallow up many of the cometary objects and debris left over from the formation of the solar system . `` So it 's doing a good job in keeping us safe by cleaning out a lot of these bits and pieces . '' Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system . Its colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium , with tiny amounts of methane , ammonia , phosphine , water , acetylene , ethane , germanium , and carbon monoxide . The chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of Jupiter 's clouds . The temperature at the top of those clouds is about 230 degrees below zero Fahrenheit -LRB- 145 degrees below zero Celsius -RRB- , but it is far hotter near the planet 's center . The core temperature may be about 43,000 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 24,000 degrees Celsius -RRB- , hotter than the surface of the sun . The most outstanding feature on Jupiter 's surface is the Great Red Spot , a storm of gas that swirls at a speed of about 225 miles -LRB- 360 kilometers -RRB- per hour at its edge . The spot -- which has been shrinking -- has a diameter equal to about three times that of Earth .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Susan Atkins , a terminally ill former Charles Manson follower convicted in the murder of actress Sharon Tate , on Tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison . Susan Atkins , Califorina 's longest-serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot . Atkins , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said . In June , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live . The California Board of Parole Hearings ' decision -- posted Tuesday on its Web site -- came after a public hearing on Atkins ' request . It means the request will not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced Atkins . The court would have had the final say on Atkins ' release . Her attorney , Eric P. Lampel , called the parole board 's decision `` unfortunate . '' '' -LSB- The board -RSB- ignored the vast majority of evidence presented , '' Lampel said . `` There was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses . It apparently fell on deaf ears . '' Known within the Manson Family as Sadie Mae Glutz , Atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including Tate , in August 1969 . According to historical accounts of the murder , Atkins stabbed Tate , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski . By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times . Atkins ' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized Los Angeles and left seven people dead . It polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars . Atkins told a 1993 parole board that Tate pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down . `` She asked me to let her baby live , '' Atkins said . '' ... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . '' Three of Tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back . Atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman . One of the first people Atkins confessed to was Virginia Graham , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the Manson Family was responsible for the murders . Graham said last month she believed Atkins should die in prison . `` She showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none , '' Graham said . `` So why should anybody show her mercy at this time ? '' Sharon Tate 's sister , Debra , has staunchly opposed Atkins ' release . `` She will be set free when judged by God , '' Debra Tate has said . `` It 's important that she die in incarceration . '' Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said Monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be `` an affront to people of this state , the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims . '' Cooley noted in his letter that Atkins was initially sentenced to death , like others in the Manson Family , including its leader , Charles Manson . Their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time . California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday he was also opposed to releasing Atkins . `` I do n't believe in -LSB- compassionate release -RSB- , '' the governor told reporters . `` I think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time . '' Even if Atkins is dying , Schwarzenegger said , `` Those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I 'm not for the compassionate release . '' Earlier , Suzan Hubbard , director of adult prisons in California , also recommended against granting Atkins ' request . Vincent Bugliosi , who prosecuted Atkins and other members of the Manson Family , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money . Through Monday , the cost for Atkins ' medical care since she was hospitalized March 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton . Terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show . In 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , Thornton has said . Ten were approved . Atkins , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is California 's longest-serving female inmate . According to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse , she is now a born-again Christian . During her incarceration , the site says , Atkins worked to help at-risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others . The Web site does not mention Atkins ' illness . Lampel said last month Atkins is paralyzed on one side . `` She can talk a little bit , '' Lampel said . `` She ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee . '' Atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes . `` I know the pain I caused Mrs. Tate , '' she said at a parole board hearing in 1985 . ln May , authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County , California , ranch where Manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there . Nothing was found , authorities said . CNN 's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"KANSAS CITY , Missouri -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the potential costs of pulling out of Iraq in a speech Wednesday . President Bush draws parallels Wednesday between the cost of pulling out of Iraq and `` the tragedy of Vietnam . '' `` Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left , '' Bush told members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars , at their convention in Kansas City , Missouri . `` Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president said . The White House billed the speech , as it did next week 's address to the American Legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad . Bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki , after voicing some frustration with him on Tuesday . `` Prime Minister Maliki 's a good guy -- good man with a difficult job and I support him , '' Bush said . `` And it 's not up to the politicians in Washington , D.C. , to say whether he will remain in his position . Watch Bush reiterate his support for al-Maliki '' Sen. Edward Kennedy , D-Massachusetts , said Bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history : `` America lost the war in Vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people , '' Kennedy said in a statement . Sen. Joe Biden , Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , invoked his own Vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech : `` It 's the president 's policies that are pushing us toward another Saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid . '' Biden said Bush continues to cling to the premise that Iraqis will rally behind a strong central government , but he believes that will not happen . `` There 's no trust within the Iraqi government ; no trust of the government by the Iraqi people ; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services ; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon , '' Biden 's statement said . But House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said more Democrats are `` bucking their party leaders '' in acknowledging progress in Iraq . `` Many rank-and-file Democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy they 've repeatedly opposed , '' Boehner said in a statement . `` But Democratic leaders , deeply invested in losing the war , would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress . '' Former presidential adviser David Gergen said Bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case . `` By invoking Vietnam he raised the question , ` if you learned so much from history , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ? ' '' Gergen said . Gergen said he did agree with Bush in one respect , though : `` He 's right , initially when we pulled back in Vietnam there were massive killings . '' On Tuesday , Bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in Iraq , saying if the Iraqi government does n't `` respond to the demands of the people , they will replace the government . '' Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Wednesday shot back at criticism of his government , including pointed remarks from a U.S. senator who called his administration `` nonfunctioning '' and urged Iraq 's parliament to turn it out of office . Speaking at a press conference in the Syrian capital of Damascus , al-Maliki characterized such comments as `` irresponsible '' and said they `` overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy . '' Government spokesman Ali Dabbagh told CNN that al-Maliki was referring to comments made Monday by Sen. Carl Levin , the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee , who called on Iraq 's parliament to turn al-Maliki 's `` nonfunctioning '' government out of office when it returns in two weeks . Levin said al-Maliki 's government was `` too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders '' to reach a political settlement that would end the country 's sectarian and insurgent violence . In his speech , Bush said withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility , citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam . `` Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' Bush said . President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in Iraq until the report comes out in September . It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill , particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . Earlier this month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin . Bush 's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . A recent CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war , and 72 percent say the Petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion . The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq . In addition to his analogy to Vietnam , Bush referred to previous conflicts in Asia in talking about the war against terror in Iraq . `` There are many differences between the wars we fought in the Far East and the war on terror we are fighting today , '' Bush said . `` But one important similarity is that at their core , they are all ideological struggles . `` The militarists of Japan and the Communists in Korea and Vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity . They killed Americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others . '' Bush said history proved skeptics wrong about Japan 's ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from Iraq wrong . `` In the aftermath of Japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy . Then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' Bush said . `` Today , in defiance of the critics , Japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The H1N1 flu virus could cause up to 90,000 U.S. deaths , mainly among children and young adults , if it resurges this fall as expected , according to a report released Monday by a presidential advisory panel . The report urges speedier production of the H1N1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by September . The H1N1 virus , commonly known as swine flu virus , could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the American population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million U.S. hospital admissions , the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported . The report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a `` plausible scenario '' involving large outbreaks at schools , inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective . Up to 40,000 U.S. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year , with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65 . With seasonal flu and H1N1 , this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place `` enormous stress '' on intensive care units nationwide , which normally operate near capacity , the report says . An H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September , at the beginning of the school year , and infections may peak in mid-October , according to the report . However , the H1N1 vaccine is n't expected to be available until mid-October , and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity , the report says . Watch more on H1N1 predictions for this fall '' The potential `` mismatch in timing '' could significantly diminish the usefulness of the H1N1 vaccine , the report says . `` Even with the best efforts , this will cause some illness , some severe illness and unfortunately , some deaths , '' Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Monday . `` But a lot so far has gone remarkably right , '' Frieden said . `` There 's a vaccine well on its way to being distributed , diagnostic tests available in well over 100 laboratories , treatments pre-positioned around the country ... and guidance issued for health care providers , schools , businesses and other communities . '' Among the report 's recommendations are for government agencies to : \u2022 Prepare several `` planning scenarios '' to determine demand for supplies and care . \u2022 Set up surveillance systems to track information about influenza-like illnesses . \u2022 Develop plans to protect the public 's most vulnerable groups , such as pregnant women and those with pre-existing medical conditions . \u2022 Speed up the production of the H1N1 vaccine and have an initial batch -- enough to vaccinate up to 40 million people , especially those who are at risk of serious disease -- by mid-September . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the government 's preparation and guidance for the public was based on the need to strike a balance `` on a continuum of being paralyzed with fear versus complacency . '' So far , clinical trials for the H1N1 vaccine have not indicated adverse side effects beyond what are experienced with the seasonal flu vaccine , Sebelius said . However , there would be no formal decision to launch a vaccination campaign until those trials were complete , she said . That decision would be hers , she said , and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary . Pregnant women , health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population , Sebelius has said . Adults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the H1N1 virus . H1N1 preparation guidelines for the nation 's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago . The plans are available at the Web site www.flu.gov . The H1N1 vaccine would require two shots , the second three weeks after the first . Immunity to the virus would not kick in until two weeks after the second shot . The World Health Organization declared the H1N1 virus a global pandemic on June 11 . More than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring , a WHO official said last week . CNN 's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia 's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar , the president 's hometown , after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday . An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu , Somalia , on Saturday . Jowhar is a major town 55 miles -LRB- 88 kilometers -RRB- southeast of Mogadishu , the capital . `` All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets , '' a local journalist said . The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government , which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu . Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union , which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006 . The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network , and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006 . After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday , the rebels started conducting `` search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town , '' the journalist added . The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town , where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces , said the journalist , who requested anonymity for safety reasons . The town 's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia 's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia , which has waged days-long attacks in the capital . In the latest round of violence , one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday . Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded , Somali officials said Friday . The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991 . Last week , a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters . `` It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government , '' said Sheikh Hassan Ya ` qub , a spokesman for Al-Shabab . `` There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us . '' The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia , or Islamic law , the spokesman said . Somalia 's new president , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , recently approved implementing sharia , but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form . Meanwhile , a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government . The warlord , Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade , was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys , who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist .","question":""}
{"answer":"Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai made an unannounced visit to Marjah on Sunday to see the gains made after a massive military offensive by Afghan and international troops to wrest control of the southern city from the Taliban . Karzai toured the city in Helmand province with Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan . Marjah residents remain skeptical of U.S. troops and the newly installed local government that has moved in and taken over , said U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson , who was in charge of the Marjah offensive . They want to know what Karzai 's government is going to be able to do for them , he said . `` We are in competition every day for the confidence and support of the population -- we 're in competition with the Taliban , '' Nicholson told reporters last week . `` We have a very narrow window of opportunity here in Marjah to make that first impression and you get one shot at it , '' he said . Dubbed Operation Moshtarak , the offensive was launched last month by an international coalition of 15,000 troops including Afghans , Americans , Britons , Canadians , Danes , and Estonians . The Marjah region has long been a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and is where the Taliban had set up a shadow government . It is a key area in Afghanistan 's heroin trade and full of the opium used to fund the insurgency . The hope now is for the United States to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the Taliban 's drug trade -- and instead grow crops like wheat , which can help them survive and provide income as well . Nicholson said for years , the Taliban-run town had no police force . Now , the Afghan government is in the process of recruiting Marjah citizens to join a new police force that would be trained by the Marines . The general had no timetable on how long it would take to truly secure the town . Meanwhile , in Baghlan province , about 50 insurgents , including more than a dozen Taliban , were killed in fighting between two rebel groups , the province 's governor said Sunday . Some 35 fighters of the Hezb-e-Eslami , or Islamic Party , and 13 Taliban died in the fighting , which began Saturday and continued into Sunday , Mohammed Akbar Barikzai told CNN . Apparently some bystanders also were killed or wounded , Barikzai said , adding he could not put an exact number on the civilian casualties . More Afghanistan coverage on Afghanistan Crossroads blog Hezb-e-Eslami is an insurgent group loyal to warlord Gulbeddin Hekmatyar . They are enemies of the Taliban , but it is rare that the anti-government groups fight each other . A group of 25 Hezb-e-Eslami fighters including their commander surrendered to Afghan National Police on Sunday , the governor said . Separately , two children were killed and two were hurt in an explosion while they were playing in Kandahar province , provincial spokesman Zalmay Ayoubi said Sunday . The explosive device was in a bag that blew up while the children were playing , the Interior Ministry said in a press release . The injured children were transferred to a hospital for treatment . Two NATO service members were killed in southern Afghanistan in two separate incidents on Sunday , a NATO news release said . One was killed by small arms fire and the other by an improvised explosive device , NATO said . The identities and nationalities of the service members were not immediately released , pending notification of the relevant national authorities , the statement said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Corpus Christi , Texas , hospital is investigating how up to 17 babies in a neonatal intensive care unit received overdoses of the blood thinner heparin . One of the babies died . Officials at Christus Spohn Hospital South say corrective action was taken after the discovery of the overdoses . The infant was one of 17 who may have received a more concentrated form of heparin than was prescribed , Christus Spohn Hospital South said in a statement . Heparin is an anticoagulant often used to clean the IVs of patients and prevent blood clots from forming in the lines . It came into the public spotlight last year when newborn twins of actor Dennis Quaid nearly died after receiving an overdose at a Los Angeles hospital . Nursing staff at the Corpus Christi hospital discovered the problem Sunday -- two days after the medication is believed to have been first administered , according to Bruce Holstien , president and CEO of Christus Spohn Health System . The hospital said it took corrective measures after the discovery . A preliminary investigation concluded that `` the medication error occurred during the mixing process within the hospital pharmacy , '' Holstein said in a statement . The baby who died `` was seriously ill , and we do not know at this time what role , if any , the higher than expected concentration of heparin played in this baby 's death , '' Dr. Richard Davis , chief medical officer for the health system , said Tuesday . `` Our deepest sympathy goes out to this family , '' he said . Twelve of the 16 other babies remain in stable condition in the neonatal intensive care unit , which cares for ill newborns . Three have been discharged , and one is critical and unstable as that baby has been since admission to the unit , Davis said . In November , Quaid 's 12-day-old twins , Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace , were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles . According to standard procedure , nurses were supposed to clean the infants ' IV lines with Hep-Lock , a drug containing a small dose of heparin , to allow the lines to flow freely . However , instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive , the twins received 10,000 units -- 1,000 times the prescribed amount . The babies survived , apparently with no permanent injury , Quaid later told members of a House committee on government oversight , although there is no way to know whether they will show any long-term effects .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazilian authorities on Thursday ruled the death of former world boxing champion Arturo Gatti a suicide , according to local media reports . Arturo Gatti was found dead on July 11 in a rented condo in Brazil , where his family was vacationing . Gatti 's death initially had been investigated as a murder . The boxer 's widow , Amanda Carina Barbosa Rodrigues , who had been arrested as a suspect , was released from jail Thursday , the newspaper O Diario de Pernambuco reported . Her lawyer , Celio Avelino , argued that it `` would have been impossible for her to suspend and hang a man of that size '' . Gatti was found dead on July 11 in a rented condo in Brazil , where he was taking a vacation with Rodrigues and their young child . Police found strangulation marks on Gatti 's neck and a blood-stained purse strap at the scene . The public safety ministry of the northeastern Pernambuco state said investigators determined that Gatti hanged himself in a stairwell , the newspaper O Globo reported . Police official Paulo Alberes said Gatti used the purse strap to end his life , O Diario de Pernambuco reported . The 37-year-old Canadian , who was born in Italy and made his name as a fighter based in New Jersey , was staying in the northeast seaside resort of Porto de Galihnas . Gatti made his reputation in his renowned trilogy of fights against `` Irish '' Micky Ward , losing the first but triumphing in the other two . He was a former International Boxing Federation -LRB- IBF -RRB- super-featherweight champion and World Boxing Council -LRB- WBC -RRB- light-welterweight champ . Gatti retired in 2007 after suffering a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez , ending with a record of 40 wins and nine losses , 31 by knockout . He grew up in Montreal , Canada , after leaving Italy at an early age , and returned to the city after his retirement . Gatti 's suicide came less than two weeks after another world champion boxer took his own life . On July 1 , three-time world boxing champion Alexis Arguello , who was the mayor of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua , was found dead in his home from a gunshot wound to the chest . He was 57 . A third boxer , former welterweight champion Vernon Forrest , died last week after being shot multiple times in a neighborhood southwest of downtown Atlanta , Georgia .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia delivered the Republican response to President Obama 's State of the Union address on Wednesday night . Here is a transcript of the speech . McDonnell : Thank you very much . Thank you . Good evening . I 'm Bob McDonnell . Eleven days ago , I was honored to be sworn in as the 71st governor of Virginia . I 'm standing in the historic House Chamber of Virginia 's Capitol , a building designed by Virginia 's second governor , Thomas Jefferson . It 's not easy to follow the president of the United States . And my 18-year-old twin boys have added pressure to me tonight by giving me exactly 10 minutes to finish before they leave to go watch `` SportsCenter . '' -LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- I 'm joined by fellow Virginians to share a Republican perspective on how to best address the challenges facing our nation today . We were encouraged to hear President Obama speak this evening about the need to create jobs . All Americans should have the opportunity to find and keep meaningful work , and the dignity that comes with it . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- Many -- many of us here tonight -- and many of you watching -- have family or friends who have lost their jobs . In fact , 1 in 10 Americans is unemployed . That is unacceptable . Here in Virginia , we 've faced our highest unemployment rate in more than 25 years , and bringing new jobs and more opportunities to our citizens is the top priority of my administration . Good government policy should spur economic growth and strengthen the private sector 's ability to create new jobs . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- We must enact policies that promote entrepreneurship and innovation so America can better compete with the world . What government should not do is pile on more taxation , regulation and litigation that kill jobs and hurt the middle class . It was Thomas Jefferson who called for `` a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned . '' He was right . Today , the federal government is simply trying to do too much . Last year , we were told that massive new federal spending would create more jobs immediately and hold unemployment below 8 percent . In the past year , more than 3 million people have lost their jobs , and yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren . The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10 . The federal debt is now over $ 100,000 per household . This is simply unsustainable . The president 's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one . The circumstances of our time demand that we reconsider and restore the proper limited role of government at every level . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- Without reform , the excessive growth of government threatens our very liberty and our prosperity . In recent months , the American people have made clear that they want government leaders to listen and then act on the issues most important to them . We want results , not rhetoric . We want cooperation , not partisanship . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- There is much common ground . All Americans agree that we need health -- health care system that is affordable , accessible , and high quality . But most Americans do not want to turn over the best medical care system in the world to the federal government . Republicans in Congress have offered legislation to reform health care , without shifting Medicaid costs to the states , without cutting Medicare , and without raising your taxes . And we will do that by implementing common sense reforms , like letting families and businesses buy health insurance policies across state lines and ending frivolous lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up the cost of your health care . And our solutions are n't 1,000-page bills that no one has fully read , after being crafted behind closed doors with special interests . In fact , many of our proposals are available online at solutions.gop.gov , and we welcome your ideas on Facebook and Twitter . -LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- All Americans agree that this nation must become more energy independent and secure . We are blessed here in America with vast natural resources , and we must use them all . Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas , nuclear , wind , coal , alternative energy that will lower your utility bills . Here in Virginia , we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas off-shore . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- But this administration 's policies are delaying off-shore production , hindering nuclear energy expansion , and seeking to impose job-killing cap-and-trade energy taxes . Now is the time to adopt innovative energy policies that create jobs and lower energy prices . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- All Americans agree that a young person needs a world-class education to compete in the global economy . As a young kid , my dad told me , `` Son , if you want a good job , you need a good education . '' Dad was right , and that 's even more true today . The president and I agree on expanding the number of high-quality charter schools and rewarding teachers for excellent performance . More school choices for parents and students mean more accountability and greater achievement . A child 's educational opportunity should be determined by her intellect and work ethic , not by her ZIP Code . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- All Americans agree that we must maintain a strong national defense . The courage and success of our armed forces is allowing us to draw down troop levels in Iraq as that government is increasingly able to step up . My oldest daughter , Jeanine , was an Army platoon leader in Iraq , so I am personally grateful for the service and sacrifice of all our men and women in uniform , and a grateful nation thanks them . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- We applaud President Obama 's decision to deploy 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan . We agree that victory there is imperative for national security . But we have serious concerns over the recent steps the administration has taken regarding suspected terrorists . Americans were shocked on Christmas Day to learn of the attempted bombing of a flight to Detroit . This foreign terror suspect was given the same legal rights as a U.S. citizen and immediately stopped providing critical intelligence . As Sen.-elect Scott Brown has said , we should be spending taxpayer dollars to defeat terrorists , not to protect them . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- Here at home , government must help foster a society in which all our people can use their God-given talents and liberty to pursue the great American dream . Republicans know that government can not guarantee individual outcomes , but we strongly believe that it must guarantee equality of opportunity for all . That opportunity exists best in a democracy which promotes free enterprise , economic growth , strong families , and individual achievement . Many Americans are concerned about this administration 's effort to exert greater control over car companies , banks , energy , and health care , but over-regulating employers wo n't create more employment , overtaxing investors wo n't foster more investment . Top-down , one-size-fits-all decision-making should not replace the personal choices of free people in a free market , nor undermine the proper role of state and local governments in our system of federalism . As our founders clearly stated , and we governors clearly understand , government closest to the people governs best . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- And no government program can ever replace the actions of caring Americans freely choosing to help one another . The scriptures say , `` To whom much is given , much will be required . '' As the most generous and prosperous nation on Earth , it is heartwarming to see Americans giving much time and money to the people of Haiti . Thank you for your ongoing compassion . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- Some people say they 're afraid that America is no longer the great land of promise that she has always been . They should not be . America will always blaze the trail of opportunity and prosperity . America will -- must always be a land where liberty and property are valued and respected and innocent human life is protected . Government should have this clear goal : Where opportunity is absent , we must create it . Where opportunity is limited , we must expand it . Where opportunity is unequal , we must make it open to everyone . -LRB- APPLAUSE -RRB- Our founders pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor to create this great nation . Now we should pledge as Democrats , Republicans and independents -- Americans all -- to work together to leave this nation an ever better place than we found it . God bless you , and God bless this great land of America . Thank you very much .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 42 people were killed and 154 were wounded in five attacks on a religious holiday Friday , an Interior Ministry official said . Shiite Muslim women light candles early Friday at a shrine in the holy city of Karbala , Iraq . The first four attacks , which together killed 36 and wounded 124 , targeted Shiites ; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target . In the latest attack , a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad . Six people died , and 30 were wounded , the official said . The attack appeared to have targeted a police patrol ; three of the fatalities were police , the official said . But most of the carnage was directed at Shiite targets , with the highest single toll exacted in the northern city of Mosul , where a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque as a funeral was taking place , killing 30 people and wounding 100 , the official said . In another attack , a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying pilgrims in the Sadr City neighborhood , killing three and wounding eight , the official said . Also in Sadr City , a roadside bomb exploded near a car , killing one person and wounding seven . And in eastern Baghdad , a car carrying pilgrims was targeted , killing two people and wounding nine . Friday was the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration in Karbala celebrating the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi , the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites . Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims . According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam , Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi `` is expected to return at the end of time as the messianic imam who will restore justice and equity on Earth . '' Last Friday , bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously , killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques . The attacks fueled fears that sectarian violence could be reigniting in the country and called into question the ability of security forces to safeguard the population as U.S. troops have taken a back seat to their Iraqi counterparts . Though the number of casualties has dropped over the past year , Friday 's attacks show that an insurgency capable of wreaking havoc remains . CNN 's Arwa Damon and Yousif Bassil contributed to this story from Baghdad .","question":""}
{"answer":"Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The investigation into the suicide bombing that killed 17 people on Saturday suggests it was the work of the Pakistan-based Haqqani network , an Afghan official said Monday . `` We have some contacts and some evidence on the ground and some information about the vehicles used and the people used , '' Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said , stressing that the results of the investigation were preliminary . `` This is another sophisticated attack by the operatives of the Haqqani network , and we are also optimistic to arrest some of their operatives in Kabul in the days ahead , '' he said . However , a spokesman for international forces in Afghanistan , which lost nine troops in the attack , said they have no indications yet that the Haqqani network was involved . `` All we have seen so far is that the Taliban have claimed responsibility . That does n't necessarily mean that it was them , but we have no other indications , '' said Brig. Gen. Cartsen Jacobsen . `` The case has to be looked at . '' Another International Security Assistance Force spokesman , Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings , added that their intelligence at this point gave no indication of the involvement of the Haqqanis . The Saturday attack killed 13 people in a NATO convoy and four Afghan civilians . Nine of the 13 were American , including five U.S. troops . The blast also claimed the lives of two British civilians , a Kosovo national and a Canadian soldier . U.S. officials have been increasingly vocal about the threat posed by the Haqqani network in recent months , arguing the organization has ties to Pakistani intelligence and enjoys safe havens in the country from whence it is able to launch attacks across the border in Afghanistan . In September , then-U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen called the Haqqani network a `` veritable arm of Pakistan 's intelligence . '' A Pentagon report on the war in Afghanistan released last week said that the ability of insurgents to flee to safe havens in Pakistan was the biggest risk to the effort to stabilize Afghanistan after nearly a decade of war . The report singled out the Haqqani network as one that has carried out major attacks . Founded in Pakistan to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , the Haqqani network has been blamed for killing more than 1,000 coalition and Afghan forces , including attacks on the U.S. Embassy and other targets in Kabul . Pakistani officials have rejected claims that they support the group , but acknowledge that they are in contact with it . This month , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that U.S. representatives met with Haqqani officials to discuss the possibility of negotiations that would end hostilities .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai discussed his sometimes-turbulent relationship with the United States on Friday as more details emerged about U.S. airstrikes in his country that killed dozens of people this week . Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government does not tolerate corruption . Karzai reflected on the past seven years of his leadership of Afghanistan and characterized his relationship with the United States as having `` serious bumps along the way , especially in the conduct of the war on terror . '' The theme he emphasized Friday was the problem of Afghan civilian casualties caused by American airstrikes . Karzai said he has raised the issue repeatedly since 2007 . `` We have complained bitterly about civilian casualties , '' he said . `` We needed to get Washington 's attention . '' The issue of civilian deaths has been at the foreground of Karzai 's trip to Washington , where he 's meeting with President Obama and other top officials . Afghan officials say that more than 100 civilians were killed in a U.S. airstrike Wednesday in Farah province , on the western border with Iran . If that death toll is confirmed , it will be the single deadliest incident involving Afghan civilians since the American-led invasion of the country in 2001 to oust the Taliban from power . A senior U.S. military official said Friday that 30 to 50 people were killed in the strikes , most of them insurgents . But the rest were civilians , including women and children . The U.S. military thinks some civilians were killed when they were caught up in the ground fighting and others in the airstrikes . The Taliban held some civilians against their will in the buildings that were attacked , according to the official . Karzai said senior Obama administration officials immediately and personally apologized to him about the incident when he met with them this week . Watch Karzai discuss U.S. airstrikes that allegedly killed civilians '' At the White House on Wednesday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari that she `` deeply regretted '' the death of Afghan civilians and pledged that the United States `` will work very hard with your governments and with your leaders to avoid the loss of innocent civilian lives . '' In response to recent suggestions by U.S. military officials that the civilian deaths in Farah province might have been staged by the Taliban , Karzai said that an Afghan government team was investigating the incident and that `` there was no doubt that the casualties were caused by bombings ... and the use of air power . '' As the president grapples with the latest incident , he 's also dealing with criticism of his administration by American officials for its perceived tolerance of corruption . An independent assessment by the non-governmental organization Transparency International rated Afghanistan as one of the most corrupt countries in the world . Karzai said his government does not tolerate corruption . `` That is not right ! That is not right ! '' he said firmly . The president pointed out that Afghan courts had recently convicted 600 people on corruption charges or on counts of major drug dealing . Karzai used the issue of corruption to segue into a critique of the way in which aid has been disbursed to Afghanistan . He asserted that of the $ 32 billion the international community had given his country since 2001 , only $ 6 billion -- or 20 percent -- has been funneled through the Afghan government . The other $ 26 billion has been spent by the donor countries themselves , and Karzai implied that the Afghan government should not be held accountable for how those funds have been spent . Support for Karzai 's critique came last year in a study by the leading British charity Oxfam that concluded that a large portion of the money the international community has given to Afghanistan does not end up in the country itself . The report estimated that 40 percent of the money spent is returned to donor countries , such as the United States , in the form of consultants ' salaries and corporate profits . Turning to the election , to be held August 20 , the Afghan president said that if he wins another five-year term , he will put a special emphasis on building dams and bringing electricity to the Afghan people . The U.S. government assesses that less than 10 percent of Afghans have access to electric power . Karzai is likely to win the vote in a landslide , given his advantages of incumbency , relative popularity and the few plausible opposition candidates . Karzai emphasized also the importance in the coming years of what he described as the `` peace process '' with the Taliban . He characterized it as being at `` the heart '' of what his government hopes to achieve and said he is `` glad that the Obama administration is backing this . '' The Afghan president said Saudi Arabia , one of the few governments to recognize the Taliban when they were in power , is `` very important '' in this process because of its leadership of the Islamic world . CNN 's Nic Robertson reported that in September , representatives of the Afghan government and former Taliban officials met in Mecca for preliminary discussions about peace in a meeting hosted by Saudi King Abdullah . But peace with the Taliban may be a long time coming . Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar has in the past several months announced at every opportunity that he has no interest in a deal with the Afghan government . And one of Mullah Omar 's deputies announced last month on a Taliban Web site that the militants would launch `` strong and robust '' operations in Afghanistan to counter the additional 21,000 American soldiers who are deploying to the country this year .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kyrgyzstan 's decision to close a key U.S. military base is `` regrettable , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , but it wo n't affect the U.S. military effort in nearby Afghanistan . Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan serves as a U.S. supply route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan . On Friday , Russia announced it would assist the U.S. in transporting nonmilitary cargo to Afghanistan , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said . The United States uses Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan as a route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan . Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced Tuesday that `` all due procedures '' were being initiated to close the base . `` It 's regrettable that this is under consideration by the government of Kyrgyzstan , and we hope to have further discussions with them , '' Clinton told reporters Thursday after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner . `` But we will proceed in a very effective manner no matter what the outcome of the Kyrgyzstan government 's deliberations might be . '' Bakiyev made his announcement at a news conference in Moscow , Russia , following news reports of a multimillion-dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan . Lavrov said on Russian television that his country intends to help get vital cargo -- but no weapons or troops -- to NATO troops in Afghanistan . The United States asked to transport the cargo through Russian territory to Afghanistan , Lavrov said . The U.S. military is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban . Gen. David Petraeus , who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia , described Manas as having `` an important role in the deployment of these forces '' and in refueling aircraft . Senior State Department officials said the State and Defense departments are working with Kyrgyzstan to keep the lease to the base . The officials said the Kyrgyzstan government has not yet responded to an offer to renew the lease . Discussions are being conducted through the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan and relevant State Department and Pentagon bureaus , the officials said . One official said the United States has almost 18 months to renegotiate the lease before it expires and hopes Kyrgyzstan will reconsider their position . Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell called Manas `` a hugely important air base . '' `` It provides us with launching point to provide supplies in Afghanistan . We very much appreciate -LSB- Kyrgyz -RSB- support in using that base , and we hope to continue , '' he said at a daily news briefing earlier this week . Clinton said the Defense Department `` is conducting an examination as to how else we would proceed that will not affect whatever decisions we make . '' Petraeus was in Kyrgyzstan last month , partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base . He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss at all the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was `` no foundation '' for news reports about the issue . The mountainous former Soviet republic is Central Asia 's second poorest country . The United States pays about $ 63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 Kyrgyz citizens there , Petraeus said . The base has been in operation since December 2001 under U.N. mandate . The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday that Russia would offer Kyrgyzstan a $ 300 million , 40-year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent , and write off $ 180 million in Kyrgyz debt . Kyrgyzstan also is home to a Russian military base , at Kant , that officially opened in 2003 . Kyrgyz Prime Minister Igor Chudinov told Russian news agency Interfax it was coincidence that talk of the base closure comes at the same time as the loan . `` The Russian decision to grant a major loan has nothing to do with the pullout of the U.S. air base from the Kyrgyz territory , '' Chudinov said . The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a U.S. airman killed a Kyrgyz citizen in December 2006 . The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan , and the dead man 's family was offered compensation . Petraeus said in January an investigation into the death was being reopened . In announcing the base closure , Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry and that his government 's `` inability to provide security to its citizens '' was proving a serious concern .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson , the show-stopping singer whose best-selling albums -- including `` Off the Wall , '' `` Thriller '' and `` Bad '' -- and electrifying stage presence made him one of the most popular artists of all time , died Thursday , CNN has confirmed . Michael Jackson , shown in 2008 , was one of the biggest pop stars in history . He was 50 . He collapsed at his residence in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles , California , about noon Pacific time , suffering cardiac arrest , according to brother Randy Jackson . He died at UCLA Medical Center . Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said an autopsy would probably be done on the singer Friday , with results expected that afternoon . Watch crowds gather at Jackson 's hospital '' `` Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color , '' the Rev. Al Sharpton said . `` To say an ` icon ' would only give these young people in Harlem a fraction of what he was . He was a historic figure that people will measure music and the industry by . '' Jackson 's blazing rise to stardom -- and later fall from grace -- is among the most startling of show business tales . The son of a steelworker , he rose to fame as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , a band he formed with his brothers in the late 1960s . By the late '70s , as a solo artist , he was topping the charts with cuts from `` Off the Wall , '' including `` Rock With You '' and `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . '' Watch Jackson perform at a 1988 concert '' In 1982 , he released `` Thriller , '' an album that eventually produced seven hit singles . An appearance the next year on a Motown Records 25th-anniversary special cemented his status as the biggest star in the country . Timeline : The life of Michael Jackson '' For the rest of the 1980s , they came no bigger . `` Thriller 's '' follow-up , 1987 's `` Bad , '' sold almost as many copies . A new Jackson album -- a new Jackson appearance -- was a pop culture event . iReport : Share your memories of Michael Jackson The pop music landscape was changing , however , opening up for rap , hip-hop and what came to be called `` alternative '' -- and Jackson was seen as out of step . His next release , 1991 's `` Dangerous , '' debuted at No. 1 but `` only '' produced one top-ranking single -- `` Black or White '' -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending , in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch . And then `` Dangerous '' was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana 's `` Nevermind , '' an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics . After that , more attention was paid to Jackson 's private life than his music career , which faltered . A 1995 two-CD greatest hits , `` HIStory , '' sold relatively poorly , given the huge expense of Jackson 's recording contract : about 7 million copies , according to Recording Industry of America certifications . A 2001 album of new material , `` Invincible , '' did even worse . In 2005 , he went to trial on child-molestation charges . He was acquitted . In July 2008 , after three years away from the spotlight , Jackson announced a series of concerts at London 's O2 Arena as his `` curtain call . '' Some of the shows , initially scheduled to begin in July , were eventually postponed until 2010 . Watch the reaction to Jackson 's passing Rise to stardom Michael Jackson was born August 29 , 1958 , to Joe Jackson , a Gary , Indiana , steelworker , and his wife , Katherine . By the time he was 6 , he had joined his brothers in a musical group organized by his father , and by the time he was 10 , the group -- the Jackson 5 -- had been signed to Motown . Watch Michael Jackson 's life in video He made his first television appearance at age 11 . Jackson , a natural performer , soon became the group 's front man . Music critic Langdon Winner , reviewing the group 's first album , `` Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 , '' for Rolling Stone , praised Michael 's versatile singing and added , `` Who is this ` Diana Ross , ' anyway ? '' The group 's first four singles -- `` I Want You Back , '' `` ABC , '' `` The Love You Save '' and `` I 'll Be There '' -- went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart , the first time any group had pulled off that feat . There was even a Jackson 5 cartoon series on ABC . Watch reaction from Motown Studios '' In 1972 , he hit No. 1 as a solo artist with the song `` Ben . '' The group 's popularity waned as the '70s continued , and Michael eventually went solo full time . He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 movie version of `` The Wiz , '' and released the album `` Off the Wall '' in 1979 . Its success paved the way for `` Thriller , '' which eventually became the best-selling album in history , with 50 million copies sold worldwide . At that point , Michael Jackson became ubiquitous . Seven of `` Thriller 's '' nine cuts were released as singles ; all made the Top Ten . The then-new cable channel MTV , criticized for its almost exclusively white playlist , finally started playing Jackson 's videos . They aired incessantly , including a 14-minute minimovie of the title cut . -LRB- `` Weird Al '' Yankovic cemented his own stardom by lampooning Jackson 's song `` Beat It '' with a letter-perfect parody video . -RRB- On the Motown Records ' 25th-anniversary special -- a May 1983 TV extravaganza with notable turns by the Temptations , the Four Tops and Smokey Robinson -- it was Michael Jackson who stopped the show . Already he was the most popular musician in America , riding high with `` Thriller . '' But something about his electrifying performance of `` Billie Jean , '' complete with the patented backward dance moves , boosted his stardom to a new level . Watch Jackson perform `` Thiller '' '' People copied his Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved , zippered-jacket look . Showbiz veterans such as Fred Astaire praised his chops . He posed for photos with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the White House . Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets , two of which -- `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Say Say Say '' -- became top five hits . Jackson became a Pepsi spokesman , and when his hair caught fire while making a commercial , it was worldwide news . It all happened very fast -- within a couple years of the Motown special . But even at the time of the `` Motown 25 '' moonwalk , fame was old hat to Michael Jackson . He had n't even turned 25 himself , but he 'd been a star for more than half his life . He was given the nickname the `` King of Pop '' -- a spin on Elvis Presley 's status as `` the King of Rock 'n' Roll '' -- and few questioned the moniker . Relentless attention But , as the showbiz saying has it , when you 're on top of the world , there 's nowhere to go but down . The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real , some rumored -- as his music . As the Web site Allmusic.com notes , he was rumored to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber and to have purchased the bones of John Merrick , the `` Elephant Man . '' -LRB- Neither was true . -RRB- He did have a pet chimpanzee , Bubbles ; underwent a series of increasingly drastic plastic surgeries ; established an estate , Neverland , filled with zoo animals and amusement park rides ; and managed to purchase the Beatles catalog from under Paul McCartney 's nose , which displeased the ex-Beatle immensely . In 1990s and 2000s , Jackson found himself pasted across the media for his short-lived marriages , the first to Elvis Presley 's daughter , Lisa Marie ; his 2002 claim that then Sony Records head Tommy Mottola was racist ; his behavior and statements during a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir done for a documentary called `` Living With Michael Jackson ; '' his changing physical appearance ; and , above all , the accusations that he sexually molested young boys at Neverland . Watch report on legacy on Michael Jackson '' The first such accusation , in 1993 , resulted in a settlement to the 13-year-old accuser -LRB- rumored to be as high as $ 20 million -RRB- , though no criminal charges were filed , Allmusic.com notes . He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets . Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block . However , an auction of material from Neverland , scheduled for April , was called off and all items returned to Jackson . Interest in Jackson never faded , however , even if some of it was prurient . In 2008 , when he announced 10 comeback shows in London , beginning in July 2009 , the story made worldwide news . The number of concerts was later increased to 50 . Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March . However , when the shows were postponed until 2010 , rumors swept the Internet that Jackson was not physically prepared and possibly suffering from skin cancer . Watch discussion of his tough life , brilliant career '' At the time , the president and CEO of AEG Live , Randy Phillips , said , `` He 's as healthy as can be -- no health problems whatsoever . '' Jackson held open auditions for dancers in April in Los Angeles . He is survived by his three children , Prince Michael I , Paris and Prince Michael II .","question":""}

Autism is considered a `` spectrum disorder '' because the number and intensity of symptoms can greatly vary among those with autism . Autism spectrum disorders -LRB- ASD -RRB- , which are also known as `` pervasive developmental disorders , '' can often be detected by the age of three . ASD is an umbrella term that includes the following diagnoses : Divide your students into five groups and assign each group a different ASD from the list above .

Then ask students : Based on what you know about Ms. Rubin , where would you say that her disability falls within the spectrum of autistic disorders ? 2 . Treating Autism Point out to students that , although autistic symptoms in children may lessen with age , autism is a lifelong disorder . There are various types of therapies available for treating autism , including behavior modification , sensory integration , medications and dietary interventions . However , because the nature and severity of autistic symptoms and behaviors can vary , no one approach works for every person . According to the National Institute of Mental Health , most professionals agree that early intervention is important and that most individuals with ASD respond well to highly structured , specialized programs .

{"answer":"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amid turmoil over the treatment of post-election detainees and controversy over the mass trials of political figures , Iran 's supreme leader on Saturday appointed a new judiciary chief , Iranian media reported . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks during the announcement that Sadeq Larijani , right , will head Iran 's judiciary . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tapped Sadeq Larijani -- brother of Iran 's powerful parliamentary speaker , Ali Larijani -- to replace Hashemi Shahroudi , a vocal hardliner against the opposition movement , who finished his 10-year term , the semi-official Mehr news agency reported . Another brother , Mohammad Javad Larijani , is the secretary-general of the judiciary 's human rights office . The development is significant in that the two brothers now head two of the three branches of Iran 's government , and tensions between Ali Larijani and hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have emerged as the president tried to assemble his Cabinet for his second term . Sadeq Larijani makes the transition as a third round of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the Islamic republic 's disputed presidential election were scheduled to appear in court Sunday , the semi-official Fars news agency said . The mass trial of about 100 Iranians is being held in the Revolutionary Court . Reformist politicians , lawyers and journalists are among those accused of protesting in an attempt to overturn government leadership . More than two dozen detainees were scheduled to be on trial Sunday , according to media reports , although it is not clear whether it will be the defendants ' first appearance in court . Among the defendants who have been on trial this month are Seyyed Mohammad Abtahi , a former Iranian vice president ; Maziar Bahari , an Iranian-Canadian reporter for Newsweek magazine ; and Kian Tajbakhsh , an Iranian-American scholar . Street protests and a brutal government crackdown followed the June 12 presidential election , leading to the arrests of more than 1,000 people . The official death toll from the post-election unrest is 30 , although opposition leaders reportedly have said it 's more than twice that figure . The new judiciary chief 's brother , Ali Larijani , spent the last week dismissing allegations by Iran 's opposition that post-election detainees were raped while in custody , according to state-run media . Larijani said that a special panel of Iran 's parliament , or Majlis , conducted a `` precise and comprehensive inquiry '' into the treatment at Tehran 's Evin and Kahrizak prisons , and found `` no cases of rape or sexual abuse , '' government-funded Press TV reported . A spokesman for Iran 's Foreign Ministry also denied that prisoners had been tortured . `` What kind of talk is this ? There was never any pressure used against these people , '' Hassan Qashqavi said Monday , according to the semi-official Mehr news agency . They were responding to accusations made by opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi who , along with opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi , ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election . Iran 's election authority declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the race , sparking hundreds of thousands of Iranians to take to the streets in protest . Iranian opposition figures , including Karrubi , have compared the treatment of the detainees to the abuse of political prisoners under the `` oppressing regime '' of the shah , who was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979 . In an open letter to former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party 's Web site , Karrubi says an `` impartial committee '' is needed to `` investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved . '' `` Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent , repeated rapes of the young women -LSB- in detention -RSB- that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems , '' Karrubi says in the letter . `` Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they -LSB- the victims -RSB- have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses . '' Larijani on Wednesday challenged Karrubi to `` present evidence of such outrages '' for the Majlis to investigate , according to Press TV .","question":""}

From what I saw of the match , he played his best tennis in the final . `` There was a lot of pressure and expectation on him . He came out and played one of his best matches .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If criminal suspects fail to invoke their right to remain silent , they have waived that right , a divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday . The high court upheld the murder conviction of a man who did not verbally assert his right to remain silent during his police interrogation . In a 5-4 ruling , the court said a suspect must explicitly tell officers he or she is asserting that right , known as Miranda rights . The famous constitutional `` right to remain silent '' and the `` right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions '' are among the well-known warnings all criminal suspects must be given upon arrest . The conservative court has generally been supportive in recent years , when police challenges to Miranda rights have been raised . `` A suspect who has received and understood the Miranda warnings , and has not invoked his Miranda rights , waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to police , '' said Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing for the court . Van Chester Thompkins was convicted of a January 10 , 2000 , murder outside a shopping mall in Southfield , Michigan . He fled the scene , but was as arrested about a year later in Ohio . Local police began what turned out to be a three-hour interrogation , with Thompkins at first forced to read aloud part of a copy of `` constitutional rights '' derived from the original Miranda case that went before the Supreme Court in 1966 . The five rights included the warning `` anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law , '' and `` the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent . '' Thompkins refused to sign the form and there was strong disagreement over whether he verbally confirmed he understood them . He remained mostly silent during questioning , but later implicated himself in the shooting . He was later convicted of first-degree murder and other offenses . The court majority sided with the police 's version of the events . `` Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk to police , '' Kennedy concluded . `` Had he made either of these simple , unambiguous statements , he would have invoked his ` right to cut off questioning . ' Here he did neither , so he did not invoke his right to remain silent . '' Kennedy 's views were supported by Chief Justice John Roberts , along with Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito . A federal appeals court in Cincinnati agreed with Thompkins his confession should be thrown out , but the high court reversed that decision . In a sharp dissent , Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the court 's ruling a `` major retreat '' from protections against self-incrimination guaranteed by the original Miranda ruling . `` Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent -- which counterintuitively requires them to speak , '' she said . `` At the same time , suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so . Those results , in my view , find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on which those precedents are grounded . '' Sotomayor said the Thompkins ruling `` turns Miranda upside down . '' Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer backed her conclusions . Thompkins had implicated himself after police asked if he believed in God . After replying yes , officers then asked , `` Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down ? '' asking about victim Samuel Morris . The court transcript said Thompkins replied `` Yes , '' and turned away , but later refused to make a written confession . The case is Berghuis v.

In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree , Strauss-Kahn is accused of having `` engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion , '' the indictment says . `` Under American law , these are extremely serious charges , '' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters outside the courtroom . `` The defendant was indicted on all the charges presented to the grand jury , '' he said . Strauss-Kahn resigned from his IMF post on Wednesday . As he entered the courtroom for the bail hearing , he looked at his wife , seated in the front row , and smiled . Strauss-Kahn on Monday had been denied bail , with the criminal court judge saying his attempt to leave the country after the alleged incident made him a flight risk . His lawyer argued Thursday that Strauss-Kahn had been scheduled to leave New York and fly to Paris on Saturday using a ticket he had bought on May 11 . Taylor said Strauss-Kahn had called the Sofitel hotel from John F. Kennedy International Airport to locate his cell phone , which he had left in the hotel , then called a second time as his plane was boarding to request that its delivery be hastened . Instead , police at the airport took him into custody . Taylor noted that his client resigned his position as IMF chief on Wednesday , and had surrendered his passport and a U.N.-issued travel document . `` In our view , no bail is required , '' the lawyer said . `` He has one interest at this time and that is to clear his name . '' Taylor added that Strauss-Kahn had agreed to live with his wife in an apartment in Manhattan after his release . Prosecutor John McConnell argued the high-profile economist had no right to bail . `` While there is presumption of innocence , the proof is substantial and it is growing every day , '' he said , adding that the forensic evidence is consistent with an attack and the alleged victim has identified Strauss-Kahn as her attacker . McConnell noted that France does not extradite its own nationals , and said Strauss-Kahn 's departure on Saturday from the hotel was in haste , suggesting `` something went on in that hotel room . '' For his part , Obus said he was solely concerned about ensuring Strauss-Kahn returns to face charges . `` We do n't want his money , '' he said . `` We just want to make sure he comes back . He has resources to live comfortably in his own country . '' As the hearing recessed , Strauss-Kahn blew his wife a kiss . Meanwhile , Strauss-Kahn 's alleged victim , a 32-year-old Guinean maid for the Sofitel hotel , testified before the grand jury on Wednesday , according to an attorney representing her . `` If you 've had any experience with someone who has been traumatized by sexual assault , reliving it in your mind is hard enough , '' attorney Jeffrey Shapiro said on CNN 's `` American Morning '' Thursday . `` Having to recount it , even to a therapist , is difficult , much less having to talk about it on the record in front of a grand jury . I mean , it 's extremely difficult , and nonetheless she 's making it through this . '' The case has set French political circles abuzz , as the international economist was widely considered the French Socialist Party 's best hope to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year 's elections . In a statement released Thursday , Sarkozy called Strauss-Kahn 's resignation `` inevitable '' and called for an `` open and transparent selection process '' for Strauss-Kahn 's replacement . In a brief letter to the IMF executive board late Wednesday , Strauss-Kahn proclaimed his innocence . He said he was stepping down to `` protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion , and especially -- especially -- I want to devote all my strength , all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence . '' `` To all , I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me , '' he said . In his letter , Strauss-Kahn said he felt compelled to resign . `` I think at this time first of my wife -- whom I love more than anything -- of my children , of my family , of my friends , '' he wrote . `` I think also of my colleagues at the Fund ; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more . '' While the search begins to replace him , the first deputy managing director , John Lipsky , will lead the fund , the IMF said in a statement . `` As acting managing director , John Lipsky will provide able and experienced leadership to the fund at this critical time for the global economy , '' Geithner said in a statement Thursday . `` We want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession for the fund 's new managing director . '' In statements , South Africa called for a candidate from a developing country to be named as Strauss-Kahn 's successor , while Brazil called for establishing criteria and conducting a thorough search . On Thursday , Lipsky urged policy makers to work together to strengthen the global economy . `` I deeply regret the circumstances that have made it necessary for me to substitute for the fund 's managing director , '' Lipsky said in a speech at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods Committee in Washington . Prosecutors allege that a naked Strauss-Kahn , 62 , chased the housekeeping employee through his suite and sexually assaulted her . But defense attorney Benjamin Brafman disputed the allegation , saying `` forensic evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible account , and we believe there is a very , very defensible case . '' Strauss-Kahn allegedly committed the offenses at noon . He checked out of the hotel at 12:28 p.m. and went to a previously scheduled lunch about 12:45 p.m. , according to a document supporting his motion to approve bail . The lunch was with one of his daughters , according to a source with knowledge of the case . After lunch , he was driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport and boarded an Air France flight that was scheduled to depart at 4:45 p.m. , the bail document says . As he sat in first class awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin , followed by a meeting with European finance ministers on Monday in Brussels , his world of power and privilege came crashing down . Police , alerted by hotel staff to the employee 's accusations , ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody . Strauss-Kahn was examined for scratches and DNA samples were taken , and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite , including possible bodily fluids from both individuals , a law enforcement official told CNN . He consented to the testing after investigators prepared a search warrant , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . The official was not authorized to release the information . Strauss-Kahn became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the IMF in September 2007 . He acknowledged reports that he 'd had an improper physical relationship with a female employee . But the relationship was consensual , an independent inquiry found , and the IMF 's executive board concluded in October 2008 that `` there was no harassment , favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director . '' Nevertheless , the board found `` that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment , '' the IMF said in a written statement . On Thursday , the IMF sent reporters updated standards for staff conduct that were approved May 6 . Under the organization 's new policy on closer personal relationships in the workplace , a supervisor who has an intimate personal relationship with a subordinate must report that relationship to the ethics adviser , his or her supervisor or the human resources department `` to seek resolution of potential conflict of interests and workplace fairness concerns , '' the new standards say .

{"answer":"Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned the United States and other nations Tuesday not to impose tougher sanctions in reaction to the Islamic country 's nuclear ambitions . Iran already faces U.N. sanctions and the five permanent Security Council members -- the United States , Britain , Russia , China and France , all of which have veto power -- have been engaged along with Germany in discussions about possible further measures . `` It 's high time for some people to open their eyes and adapt themselves to real changes that are under way , '' Ahmadinejad said at a news conference in Tehran . Asked specifically about the threat of tougher sanctions , the Iranian president said , `` We prefer that they move in the spirit of cooperation . It wo n't put us in trouble . They themselves will get into trouble . '' Ahmadinejad also seemed to threaten unspecified retaliation , saying Iran wo n't act like it has in the past . `` Definitely , we will show a reaction that will put them to shame , like always , '' he said . Ahmadinejad 's comments came one day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal expressed concern over Iran 's nuclear program . Meeting in Riyadh with al-Faisal during a four-day trip to the Middle East , Clinton called Iran 's recent announcement that it has started to produce higher-grade enriched uranium `` a provocative move in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions . '' Clinton further warned that the `` increasingly disturbing and destabilizing actions '' by Iran `` will result in increasing isolation . '' Earlier Monday , Clinton told a town hall meeting in Doha , Qatar , that the United States believes Iran `` is moving toward a military dictatorship . '' Clinton was responding to a question about whether the United States was preparing for military action in Iran . `` No , we are planning to bring the world community together in applying pressure to Iran through sanctions adopted by the United Nations that will be particularly aimed at those enterprises controlled by the Revolutionary Guard , which we believe is , in effect , supplanting the government of Iran , '' Clinton said . She added , `` We see that the government of Iran , the supreme leader , the president , the parliament , is being supplanted , and that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship . Now , that is our view . '' Clinton called for stronger actions after Iran announced it is stepping up production of highly enriched uranium . `` Iran leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps , '' Clinton said . `` Together , we are encouraging Iran to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions . '' Speaking at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum , Clinton said the United States is `` working actively '' with its partners `` to prepare and implement new measures to convince Iran to change its course . '' Ahmadinejad said at a Monday news conference that Iran had no choice but to enrich the uranium because the International Atomic Energy Agency did not fulfill its obligation to provide the Islamic republic with the nuclear material . Iran said last week that it had completed its first batch of 20 percent enriched uranium and will soon triple production . Uranium enriched to 20 percent can set off a nuclear reaction , scientists say , but is not weapons grade . Answering a question from CNN , Ahmadinejad said it was not economical for Iran to perform its own enrichment . The Islamic republic would rather buy it from other sources , he said . But the nation 's supply of enriched uranium was running low and Iran could not afford to wait any longer , Ahmadinejad said . He would not confirm or deny that Iran would be willing to stop its enrichment program if it could obtain the uranium elsewhere . Iranian enrichment of uranium at 20 percent is `` wholly unjustified , '' three diplomats wrote the U.N. nuclear agency 's director-general in a letter obtained Tuesday by CNN . The U.S. , French and Russia ambassadors to the IAEA said the move is `` contrary to U.N. Security Council resolutions '' and poses `` a further step toward a capability to produce high enriched uranium . '' Such an enrichment , the three said in a letter dated February 12 , `` is not only unnecessary , but would serve to further undermine the confidence of the international community in Iran 's actions . '' On Monday , U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley talked about the joint letter to IAEA director General Yukiya Amano . `` We referred back to the Tehran research reactor proposal from last fall that Iran has yet to accept and we alluded to the availability of medical isotopes on the international market , '' Crowley said . `` Given these two legitimate and immediately available options , there is no rationale for Iran to attempt to produce its own fuel . '' Asked about comments made Monday by the director of Iran 's Atomic Energy Organization , Ali Akbar Salehi , to the semi-official Fars News Agency that Iran would be prepared to stop its 20 percent enrichment , Crowley encouraged Iran to put forth its proposals . `` If they have ideas on how to enact the Tehran research reactor proposal , they should bring them to the IAEA and we can have another round of talks , '' Crowley said . `` Within the parameters of the Tehran research reactor proposal , we are happy to discuss effective ways of implementing it . Our problem is that we had one meeting on the issue and Iran has yet to come back to the table . '' Iran insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful civilian purposes . Clinton said she 's not so sure . `` Iran has consistently failed to live up to its responsibilities , '' she said . `` It has refused to demonstrate to the international community that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful . And last year , the world learned of a secret nuclear facility near the city of Qom . '' Iran could obtain the enriched uranium it says it wants for medical research by accepting a proposal under which Iran would ship its uranium abroad to be enriched and then returned , but Iran has rejected that offer , Clinton said . `` This has only deepened the international community 's doubts about Iran 's nuclear intentions , along with the Iranian government 's own isolation . '' She added that Iran has also refused recent diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution . A soon-to-be released U.S. assessment of Iran 's nuclear program is expected to conclude the government has resumed limited work on a nuclear weapon , according to a U.S. official .

{"answer":"Editor 's note : Nancy G. Brinker is the founder of Susan G. Komen for the Cure , named after her only sister , Susan , who died from breast cancer in 1980 . The organization describes itself as the `` world 's largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists fighting to save lives , empower people , ensure quality care for all and energize science to find cures . '' Brinker served as Ambassador to Hungary in 2001 and Chief of Protocol of the United States during the Bush administration . Nancy Brinker says a bill by Sens. Ted Kennedy and Kay Bailey Hutchison would renew the fight against cancer . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During his first address to a joint session of Congress , President Obama urged a new effort `` to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American , including me , by seeking a cure for cancer in our time . '' It was a call to action that resonated for me , as it 's a cause I 've dedicated my life to pursuing . Nearly three decades ago I promised my sister , Suzy , who died at age 36 from breast cancer , that I would do everything I could to end the disease that took her life . A couple of years later , I too was diagnosed with breast cancer , at age 37 . Fortunately my cancer was detected and treated much earlier than Suzy 's , and it was much smaller and not nearly as aggressive . Following a mastectomy and four rounds of chemotherapy , I am now a 25-year survivor . We have made a lot of progress since the 1980s . We now have a basic understanding of breast cancer , which is the foundation for discovering the cures . And with this new understanding , we 're moving toward more personalized treatments -- as each patient and each tumor is different , their treatment must reflect those differences . Yet while we are in position to experience significant advances , the sad fact remains that we are still facing an enormous cancer crisis -- cancer will claim the lives of more than a half-million people this year -- about 1,500 people a day . In all , 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives , including approximately 1.4 million new cases this year alone . With the graying of the Baby Boom generation , we are about to experience a cancer tsunami . Thus I was inspired to hear our new president call for reigniting our nation 's war on cancer . And it did n't take long for a bipartisan group of senators to answer that challenge . The group , led by Sens. Edward Kennedy , D-Massachusetts , and Kay Bailey Hutchison , R-Texas , who have been working together and in close consultation and collaboration with the cancer community for more than a year , introduced the 21st Century Cancer ALERT -LRB- access to life-saving early detection , research and treatment -RRB- Act . This bill is an effort to address our shortcomings and renew our commitment to discovering and delivering the cures to cancer . In a period where Democrats control both the Congress and the White House and true bipartisanship is a rare and precious commodity , I am grateful to both senators , particularly Hutchison , for ensuring that this was a true partnership , and that everyone had a seat at the table . For Kennedy , this is obviously a personal issue . Hutchison has been with us in this fight since our early days , and this would not have happened without her leadership . The first step in saving lives is in detecting cancer early . If breast cancer is a guide , developing effective early detection techniques is critically important to increasing mortality rates . For example , when my sister died , only 77 percent of women who discovered their cancer before it spread beyond the breast survived at least five years . After nearly three decades of investments and advancements , the five-year survival rate has increased to 98 percent . Unfortunately , many cancers still do not have effective early detection methods . Ovarian cancer is a particularly devastating example : There is no screening diagnostic , thus a diagnosis is most often made after the cancer has spread . According to the American Cancer Society , when ovarian cancer is detected locally , the survival rate is 92 percent ; however , only 1 in 5 cases are detected at this stage , dropping the overall five-year survival rate to only 45 percent . Mortality rates are even more disturbing for lung and pancreatic cancers . This has to change . This legislation seeks to address this by placing an emphasis on early detection and promoting the discovery and development of biomarkers so cancers can be detected at the earliest possible stage , when cancer is most treatable . It will also strengthen the cancer research process by promoting public-private partnerships and collaboration between government agencies . And the bill stresses translational research , so new discoveries and breakthroughs in the laboratory make their way to patients ' bedsides as quickly as possible . At the same time , we have to remind ourselves as we push for science to develop the early detection methods that will save lives tomorrow , millions of our friends and loved ones do not have sufficient access to the detection and treatment methods available today . Tens of millions of people are uninsured and lack access to basic health care . Federal and state programs that provide support to underserved people with cancer are dramatically underfunded , leading to huge gaps in access . Even those with insurance often have difficulty accessing life-saving treatments , whether it is because they live in a rural community , have language barriers or are faced with roadblocks to participating in a clinical trial . The Cancer ALERT Act will begin to improve access to cancer care for underserved populations by expanding access to clinical trials and patient navigation services . One thing I 've learned over this journey is that we can do anything if we just put our minds to it and show that we are committed to success . This effort is an important and promising step in showing that discovering and delivering the cures for cancer is still a national priority , and that we are committed to seeing it through . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Brinker .","question":""}

{"answer":"Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The three security guards and the driver of an American development expert who was abducted in Pakistan on Saturday have been detained for questioning , a police official said Monday . The four men are not considered suspects at this point , said the official , who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media . Under Pakistani law , police can detain someone for up to 72 hours without charging them with a crime . Investigators have no leads in the case and are not any closer to finding out what happened to the American , whom the U.S. Embassy identified as Warren Weinstein . Weinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen , posing as neighbors offering food , pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards , U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said . Weinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc. , a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington , Virginia , a Pakistani official said . He 's is a world-renowned development expert , with 25 years of experience , according to his company 's website . The site says he was heading what the company described as the `` Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness . '' As Weinstein 's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday , three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month , according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain . Once the gate was opened , the three men forced their way in while five other suspects entered the house from the back , Hussain said . The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths , he said . They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein 's room , where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol , and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car , Hussain said . He said Weinstein is in his 60s . There has been no claim of responsibility nor any demands by any groups , according to senior police official Awais Ahmed . Weinstein has lived in the residence in an upscale Lahore neighborhood for several years , Ahmed said . Weinstein is a Fulbright Scholar in Belgium and is proficient in six languages , with a doctorate in international law and economics , according to his company website . U.S. Embassy officials are working with Pakistani authorities on the case , Embassy spokesman Alberto Rodriguez said Saturday . The U.S. State Department updated a travel advisory for Americans traveling and working in Pakistan this week , warning that extremist groups operating in the country were continuing to target U.S. and other Western citizens and interests . It cited part of the reason for the advisory as `` reported '' abductions of U.S. citizens `` for ransom or personal reasons , '' including the kidnapping of a U.S. citizen in Lahore in June . No further details about that incident were released . Abductions are not unusual in Pakistan , though those targeted are typically Pakistani rather than American or Western . In early July , a Swiss couple was grabbed at gunpoint while traveling in the town of Loralai in the volatile southwestern Balochistan province , provincial officials said at the time . Three weeks after their abduction , Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive . Weinstein 's abduction follows another high-profile incident involving an American in Lahore . Raymond Davis , a CIA contractor , was charged with killing two men in January but was released in March after compensation was paid to their families .

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui was convicted Wednesday of attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan in 2008 . The jury found Siddiqui guilty of seven counts , including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers . The Manhattan jury began deliberations Monday afternoon and sent a note shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday saying they had reached a verdict . Siddiqui listened to the verdict without emotion but let out an outburst once the jury was escorted out of the courtroom . `` This is a verdict from Israel , not America , '' she said . `` Anger should be directed to where it belongs . I can testify to this . I have proof . '' Authorities removed her from the courtroom . She will be sentenced May 6 . Siddiqui 's family said she had been unjustly found guilty . `` Today 's verdict is one of many legal errors that allowed the prosecution to build a case against our sister based on hate , rather than fact , '' they said in a statement released through the International Justice Network . `` We believe that as a result , she was denied a fair trial , and today 's verdict must be overturned on appeal . '' Prosecutors said Siddiqui shot at two FBI special agents , a U.S. Army warrant officer , an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18 , 2008 . Authorities said Siddiqui used an officer 's rifle to fire two shots at the personnel , who were hidden from her view by a curtain . She hit no one . The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol , hitting Siddiqui at least once . Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor 's compound in central Afghanistan after finding her with bomb-making instructions , excerpts from the `` Anarchist 's Arsenal , '' papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks , and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars , according to a September 2008 indictment . The indictment said Siddiqui had `` handwritten notes that referred to a ` mass casualty attack ' '' listing several locations in the United States and `` construction of ` dirty bombs . ' '' The notes also `` discussed various ways to attack ` enemies , ' including by destroying reconnaissance drones , using underwater bombs , and using gliders , '' the indictment said . `` Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific ` cells , ' ` attacks ' by certain ` cells , ' and ` enemies , ' '' the indictment said . `` Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training . '' Siddiqui , whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda , was extradited to the United States in August 2008 . Since 2003 , the whereabouts of Siddiqui , an American-educated neuroscientist , had been the source of much speculation . According to Amnesty International , Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi , Pakistan , in March 2003 , shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location . Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi . But in May 2004 , then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paying for sex with trafficked or exploited women would become a crime under new laws proposed by the UK government Wednesday . Under proposed laws , it would be illegal to buy sex from a trafficked or exploited woman in the UK . The act of purchasing sex is not currently a criminal offense in England and Wales -- although there are laws against paying for sex in a public place and persistently soliciting prostitutes . Now UK Home Secretary -LRB- interior minister -RRB- Jacqui Smith says she is proposing the new measures to protect vulnerable women and tackle the demand for prostitution . Britain 's interior ministry , known as the Home Office , introduced the new measures Wednesday after a six-month review that looked at what else the government could do to protect women being exploited for sexual gain . `` I want to do everything we can to protect the thousands of vulnerable women coerced , exploited or trafficked into prostitution in our country , and to bring those who take advantage of them to justice , '' Smith said in a statement . Smith said the new measures will shift the focus onto sex buyers because they create demand for prostitution and demand for the trafficking of women for sex . `` There will be no more excuses for those who pay for sex , '' she added . As part of the review , the government looked at the experience of other countries including Sweden -- which has criminalized paying for sex -- and the Netherlands , where brothels are licensed . The government estimates around 80,000 people are involved in prostitution in Britain , with about 4,000 women having been trafficked for sexual exploitation . It says the prostitution market nationwide is worth up to # 1 billion -LRB- $ 1.52 billion -RRB- . Trafficking is the movement of women from one place to another for the purposes of sex . British Authorities have said trafficking usually involves the trafficker promising to bring a woman to Britain for a better life and then forcing her into prostitution . The measures -- which must be approved by Parliament -- would mean that those committing the new offense would be given a criminal record and fined # 1,000 -LRB- $ 1,520 -RRB- -- even if it was a person 's first offense and the offender did not know the prostitute was being controlled by a pimp or had been trafficked . Police would also be given powers to close and seal premises suspected of being used for sexual exploitation , such as brothels , which the government said will prevent further exploitation and abuse from taking place . Current law prohibits curb crawling , which involves soliciting prostitutes from a motor vehicle persistently or in a manner that causes annoyance to the neighborhood . It also prohibits `` persistent soliciting , '' which is essentially curb crawling without a car . But representatives of sex workers attacked the plans Wednesday , saying they will force prostitution further underground and make women more vulnerable to violence . `` It 's going to really make it more difficult for men to use the sex industry , and it 's going to mean that women are going to have to take more risks in order to earn the same money , '' said Cari Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes . `` It 's also going to drive it underground . It 's going to increase the stigma . '' Mitchell said the government 's figures are inflated , and that most immigrant women working as prostitutes have not been trafficked and are working independently . The new measures , she said , confuse prostitution with trafficking and take the focus off those women who may be vulnerable . `` Of women who may be trafficked and forced , what they need is to be able to come forward and report to the police without any fear of being deported , '' Mitchell told CNN . The new restrictions on curb crawling wo n't end the practice , Mitchell said , but simply give prostitutes less time to weigh up any potential dangers before getting in the client 's car .","question":""}

She reached a career high of 33rd in the world rankings back in May , but is now 36th . `` Sometimes you play your best and win easy , but sometimes you do n't play your best and really have to fight hard , '' said Vakulenko , who squandered points for 5-3 leads in both the second and third sets . `` I 'm just going to try my best -- I 've never played her and I 'm looking forward to it . '' Former world No. 1 Davenport is seeking her second win in three tournaments since returning from a one-year hiatus to have a baby . The 31-year-old , who is unseeded after accepting a wild-card to enter the Canadian tournament for the first time , also had to battle to beat Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva 6-2 6-7 -LRB- 3-7 -RRB- 6-3 in the semifinals . The three-time Grand Slam winner has surged back up the rankings from 234th to 126th after winning her comeback tournament in Bali and then reaching the last four in Beijing . The American has now beaten Zvonareva in all six encounters between the two players . `` I played well in the first set and had some chances early in the second set , but I did n't quite capitalize on them . I was able to come back but at 4-4 and 5-5 I just did n't return well enough , '' Davenport said . `` I was happy I was able to regroup in the third set . Physically I feel good . There are lots of positives I can take from it , especially beating a really good player and now being in the final . `` I want to be the one on the offensive and not the defensive , and that 's what I 'm going to try to do . `` I was trying to watch the first semifinal and see if that helped , but I play so much differently than Julie Ditty that it was hard to get anything from it .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into the massive oil spill spreading through the Gulf of Mexico . Holder said the investigation , which began `` some weeks ago , '' would be comprehensive and aggressive . He promised that the federal officials will prosecute anyone who broke the law . `` We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law , '' Holder said . `` We have what we think is a sufficient case to have begun a criminal investigation . '' Holder emphasized that the investigation will cover all aspects of the oil spill , including the deaths of 11 workers in the April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig that started the leak . He refused to name any potential targets of the investigation , saying , `` I do n't want to unnecessarily cast aspersions . '' However , Holder said `` nothing is off the table '' in the probe , and he cited false statements as one of several potential targets of criminal charges . `` This disaster is nothing less than a tragedy , '' Holder said . `` As our review expands in the days ahead , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive . We will not rest until justice is done . '' Holder stressed that `` anyone found responsible for this spill -LRB- must be -RRB- held accountable . That means enforcing the appropriate civil -- and if warranted , criminal -- authorities to the full extent of the law . '' Among other things , Holder said Justice Department lawyers are examining possible violations of the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . He also said prosecutors are looking into potential violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty and Endangered Species Acts , which provide penalties for injury and death to wildlife . BP responded in a statement that it `` will cooperate with any inquiry the Department of Justice will undertake , just as we are doing in response to the other inquires that are already ongoing . '' Holder made the announcement during a visit to the Gulf to survey the BP oil spill and meet with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi , according to the Justice Department . Last month , a group of senators -- including Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-California -- sent Holder a letter expressing concerns `` about the truthfulness and accuracy of statements submitted by BP to the government in its initial exploration plan for the site . '' They asked the attorney general to investigate possible criminal and civil wrongdoing . In a reply to that letter last week , a Justice Department official refused to say whether a criminal investigation had begun . `` The Department of Justice will take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that those responsible for this tragic series of events are held fully accountable , '' Assistant Attorney General Ronald Welch wrote . Holder said last month the Justice Department would `` ensure that BP is held liable . '' Boxer issued a statement Monday praising the criminal probe . `` In preparation for the Environment Committee 's hearings on the oil spill , it became clear that BP 's assurances that they could respond effectively to a serious spill at this site were totally at odds with reality , '' Boxer said in the statement . `` What is happening in the Gulf -- eleven people dead , and an entire ecosystem and the jobs that depend on it at risk -- justifies a thorough criminal investigation .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Mississippi lesbian Tuesday won a judge 's backing for her contention that her First Amendment rights were violated when her high school refused to allow her to attend her prom with her girlfriend . But U.S. District Judge Glen H. Davidson refused to order the Itawamba County School District in Fulton , Mississippi , to hold the dance it had canceled over the matter . In his 12-page order , Davidson also ruled that Itawamba Agricultural High School 's denial of 18-year-old Constance McMillen 's request to wear a tuxedo to her prom was a violation of her rights . `` The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same-sex date , '' Davidson wrote . `` The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment . '' When school officials told McMillen she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event , the senior went to the American Civil Liberties Union , which demanded the school change its policy . In response , the school district canceled the prom altogether . Davidson denied a motion for an injunction filed by McMillen against the school district 's superintendent , the school 's principal and its assistant principal asking the court to order that the April 2 prom be reinstated , saying that parents were planning a private event to be held on that date for all students , including McMillen . Requiring school officials `` to step back into a sponsorship role at this late date would only confuse and confound the community on the issue , '' he said . Read the judge 's opinion -LRB- PDF -RRB- Both sides in the dispute were happy with the outcome . `` It vindicates Constance 's rights , '' said Christine Sun , senior counsel with the ACLU 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender project . `` It sets a legal precedent for gay and lesbian students all over the country that they have the right to bring a same-sex date to the prom and also to wear gender-nonconforming clothes to the prom . We were looking for a ruling that what the school did was violate her rights , '' Sun said . School board attorney Michele Floyd said the school district was also pleased with the decision . She said the parent-sponsored event , which may be called a ball instead of a prom , is to be held in Tupelo , 19 miles away . But ACLU 's Sun said McMillen had not received an invitation . `` We have n't heard anything about this private prom other than what this school district has told us , '' she said . `` It remains to be seen whether she will be able to attend the private prom . '' McMillen 's case is going forward on a damages claim and the ACLU 's request for attorneys ' fees , she said . `` She got what she wanted , and now it 's just a question of what the damages might be in her case . '' `` I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together , '' McMillen said last week in an ACLU news release . `` A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else , which I really appreciate . But all I 've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school 's prom with my girlfriend . '' At the center of the lawsuit is a February 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex . Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence , according to the documents .","question":""}
{"answer":"Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in last week 's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood urged in 2007 that Muslims in the U.S. Army be allowed to claim conscientious objector status when it comes to fighting other Muslims in war , a defense official said Tuesday . Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan also discussed religious aspects of Islam during a presentation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as part of a final project for his residency tenure , said the official , who has knowledge of the investigation into Hasan . `` It 's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims , '' Hasan said , according to a slide show that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . `` Muslims -LSB- sic -RSB- soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting\/killing believers unjustly , '' a Hasan slide said , though he added that individual feelings `` will vary ! '' Hasan is the only suspect in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on Thursday that left 13 people dead and 42 wounded . Twelve of the dead were soldiers . Hasan remains in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas , after having been shot by a police officer . Dr. Val Finnell , a former medical school classmate of Hasan 's , described him as `` a very outspoken opponent of the war '' in the classroom and in public settings . `` He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam , '' Finnell said . He added that he was shocked by Thursday 's shooting . `` However , that said , given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people , I am not surprised . '' Hasan 's comments came in what was supposed to be a medical seminar , The Washington Post reported , but instead he spoke to senior Army doctors about Islam . Hasan , a psychiatrist , aimed to describe `` religious conflicts that Muslims may have with the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' according to the newspaper 's report . The report is based on a slideshow that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . See the presentation and the Post 's report In a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation `` indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . '' Hasan came under investigation for a time last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric 's communications , a federal law enforcement official said . An employee of the Defense Department 's Criminal Investigative Services , assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force , ultimately made the decision to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan 's personnel files . However , a senior defense department official said late Tuesday that the agency was not aware of any such communication . `` Contrary to reports we have seen in some news outlets , based on what we know now , neither the United States Army nor any other organization within the Department of Defense knew of Major Hasan 's contacts with any Muslim extremists , '' the official said . `` Not until after the tragic shooting at Fort Hood last week were Major Hasan 's e-mail communications first brought to our attention by federal investigators . '' President Obama traveled to Fort Hood for a memorial service on Tuesday for the victims of the shooting . Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other dignitaries also attended the service . Read profiles of the shooting victims Hasan , 39 , was wounded several times during the attack . His ventilator was removed over the weekend , and he began talking afterward , hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said . Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday , but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney , according to senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation . Hasan has retained a lawyer , ex-military judge and retired Army Col. John Galligan , the attorney told CNN affiliate KXXV-TV . `` Like anybody that 's facing criminal charges in the military arena , he 's entitled to a defense counsel , '' Galligan told the station . Galligan said he had a 25-minute conversation with Hasan , and the two did not talk much about the Fort Hood shooting . `` There 's still a lot to be done on the medical side , '' Galligan said . Hasan , a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997 . He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military . Hasan , a Muslim , also told his family that he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 . In August , he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read `` Allah is Love '' was torn off . A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For 13-year-old Brandon Marti , the intranasal vaccine felt `` good , '' `` cold '' and `` watery '' at the Children 's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx , New York , on Tuesday . Brandon Marti , 13 , receives a dose of the intranasal vaccine for the novel H1N1 flu Tuesday . Marti , among the first to get vaccinated against the novel H1N1 influenza virus this week , said he would tell his friends and classmates that `` the swine flu vaccine is good , and protects me from getting the swine flu . '' New York has received a shipment of 68,000 doses of the FluMist variety vaccine . This form was made available before the injectable kind because it was ready first , said Thomas Skinner , spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . As states across the country receive and distribute the vaccine , questions still linger about who should get it and why . Here are some guidelines : Where is the vaccine ? The campaign to inoculate millions of Americans against H1N1 flu began Monday . Every state is developing a vaccine delivery plan , according to the CDC . How much do you know about H1N1 ? Take our quiz . '' All states in the United States have ordered vaccine , said Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the CDC , at a briefing Tuesday . Each Friday , the CDC will provide information about how much vaccine is available to states and how much has been ordered . So far , about 2.2 million doses out of the available 2.4 million have been ordered , he said . Learn more from your state . The vaccine is being made available as soon as it comes off the production line , Frieden said . This week the intranasal mist variety , called FluMist , became available , and next week the injectable form will made available , he said . iReport.com : Are you getting the H1N1 vaccine ? Frieden acknowledged that these first few weeks will be `` bumpy '' in terms of distributing the vaccine , and that demand is currently greater than supply . However , he expects that supply will soon outstrip demand . `` It will take some time to get the whole system , from the manufacturer through the distributor to the providers and to people who want to get vaccinated , up and running , '' he said . Who should get it ? The CDC recommends that specific groups of people get vaccinated first , but there are no rankings within the priority groups , Frieden said . The nasal spray version of the vaccine should be used only in people 2 to 49 and who do not have an underlying health problem , Frieden said . The priority groups for it include health care workers , children and people who care for infants , he said . Pregnant women should not have the FluMist version because it contains the live virus . Kathleen Sebelius and CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss H1N1 vaccine '' Ashley Marti , 9 , sister of Brandon , also got her H1N1 vaccination Tuesday . Health care and emergency medical services personnel should be in the priority group because vulnerable patients could potentially contract the flu from them , the CDC said . Already , infections among health care workers have been reported , and the health care system capacity could become significantly lowered if large numbers of these workers are absent , the CDC said . Once the injectable shot becomes available , all priority groups should be vaccinated , the CDC said . These include pregnant women , because they are at higher risk of complications and may be able to provide protection to unvaccinated infants . People from 6 months to 24 years old should also receive the vaccine , and people from 25 to 64 should get it they have a chronic health disorder or a compromised immune system , the CDC said . According to a CNN\/Opinion Corp. poll in late August , two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu . Does anyone have to get it ? There are no formal penalties for those who do not get the vaccine , but people in the military are required to receive it , according to the American Forces Press Service . The state government of New York has said that health care workers must get the vaccine , although no law outlines penalties for noncompliance . Still , some workers fear they 'll lose their jobs if they do n't get vaccinated . How many doses do you need ? For people 10 and older , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of one dose of the vaccine . For children 9 and younger , two doses may be required , Frieden said . The CDC recommends that three to four weeks pass between the first and second dose . What if the virus mutates ? Nathan Stein , 7 , participated in a clinical trial for the H1N1 vaccine over the summer . The virus has not changed much since the spring , Frieden said . In fact , the part of the virus that determines whether it 's very deadly is different from the part that determines whether the vaccine will fight against it , he said , meaning that vaccination will still most likely offer protection even if the H1N1 flu becomes more deadly . Why should you get it ? Frieden said the flu can range from mild to severe . It can make a person sick for one , two or three days , leading to absence from school or work , and some people may even need hospitalization . `` Tragically , some people may die from it , '' he said . Still , it is not a disease that sends a lot of people to the hospital , he said . The vaccine is also safe , Frieden said . The novel flu vaccine is made in the same production facilities by the same companies with the same methods as the seasonal flu vaccine , and it is the same kind of vaccine that has been given each year , he said . His own children will get it , as will the families of other public health experts , he said . Some people are concerned that it is too late to get vaccinated against the novel virus , but Frieden also dismissed this . `` It 's too soon to say it 's too late because we do n't know what the rest of the season will bring , '' he said . CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Reports that Iran has sentenced a British embassy employee to four years in prison are `` deeply concerning , '' British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday . Hossein Rassam `` is a hardworking embassy official '' who was `` doing work that was wholly within the boundaries of diplomatic work , '' Miliband said at a news conference in Brussels , Belgium . The reported sentence is `` wholly unjustified and represents further harassment of embassy staff for going about their normal and legitimate duties , '' Miliband had said earlier , in a statement issued Wednesday . Rassam is one of several British embassy employees arrested in the wake of Iran 's disputed June 12 presidential election . Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the official results declaring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner . Iran accused Britain and the United States of fomenting the unrest . Rassam was put on trial in August . The European Union , France and the United Kingdom denounced the proceeding . Rassam 's lawyer has not officially been informed of the embassy worker 's sentence , and he does not know where Rassam is , he told Iranian media . Abdolsamad Khorramshahi told the Fars News Agency that the terms of Rassam 's bail did not prevent him from leaving the country . He said Rassam had been in Iran recently , but he did not know his current whereabouts . He said he could not express an opinion on the verdict before the court officially informs him of it , which he said normally happens after it is issued . The European Union condemned the reported verdict as `` unjustified and harsh , '' and urged `` the Iranian authorities to overturn it swiftly , '' the Swedish presidency of the 27-nation bloc said in a statement Thursday . `` Any action against one EU country -LRB- a citizen or member of embassy staff -RRB- is considered an action against the entire EU , and will be treated accordingly , '' the statement said . France also condemned the sentencing of Rassam . Miliband said he understood the sentence could be appealed and urged `` the authorities to conduct this quickly and overturn this harsh sentence . '' `` This will be seen as an attack against the entire diplomatic community in Iran , '' he said in a statement late Wednesday . The Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador to London , and Britain 's envoy in Tehran spoke to Iran 's deputy foreign minister , Miliband said .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One summer night in 2004 , 3-year-old Riley Fox lay asleep on a couch not far from her 6-year-old brother on a chair in the living room . Their father was sleeping in a nearby bedroom . The FBI joined the search for the killer of 3-year-old Riley Fox last month . Just before 8 a.m. , Kevin Fox was awakened by his son . The boy told his father that Riley was missing from the sofa . Fox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington , Illinois , home and then called police , according to authorities . His wife , Melissa , was in Chicago participating in a charity walk , and when she found out , she rushed home . Nearly 500 volunteers , along with police and family , searched for the little girl . Her body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek , Illinois , just 4 miles from the family 's home . She 'd been bound and gagged with duct tape , raped and drowned , according to the Will County Sheriff 's Office and the coroner 's report . It was June 6 , 2004 , the start of a horrific ordeal for the family . Fox was arrested and charged with the killing , only to be exonerated by DNA evidence . More than five years later , authorities have yet to capture Riley 's killer . Kathleen Zellner , Fox 's attorney , said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that Riley was snatched from her home , sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned . Because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape , she was unable to swim or save herself , Zellner said . According to Zellner , Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared , he had gone to a street fair while the children 's grandparents looked after them . On his way home , about midnight , Fox picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500-square-foot cement box family home . Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV , Zellner said . Fox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke , Zellner said , as was the back door . He has said he locked the front door before he 'd gone to bed . The back door 's lock had been broken weeks ago ; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut . According to the family , those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members . `` From the beginning , we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night , '' Melissa Fox said . `` But it was clear that police were looking at Kevin suspiciously . '' Indeed , five months later , Will County sheriff 's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter . Zellner says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning . Fox spent eight months in jail , but DNA evidence from the rape kit conducted on Riley 's body finally exonerated him . There was no semen found during the autopsy , Zellner says , but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering Riley 's mouth and elsewhere on her body . In late 2007 , the family won a $ 15.5 million wrongful-arrest suit against the sheriff 's detectives . The Foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time . `` For weeks before her disappearance , I could n't shake a feeling of uneasiness , strange noises at night outside our house , as if someone were lurking and watching us , '' Melissa Fox said . Zellner believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a Chevrolet Cavalier parked outside the Fox home that night , before Kevin Fox and his children returned home . `` It 's only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again , '' Zellner said , `` even though Kevin was cleared nearly four years ago . '' Last month , the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow . FBI agents combed Riley 's neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses . `` The FBI is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation , '' Glasgow said in a statement . `` We can not allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved . '' The family is offering a $ 100,000 reward , and the FBI is offering $ 10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox 's death . Anyone with more information is urged to call the FBI 's Chicago office at 312-421-6700 .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Robert Byrd came to Congress from West Virginia , a postage stamp cost 3 cents and kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr. Potato Head . On Wednesday , almost 57 years later , Byrd became the longest-serving member of Congress in history . Two days before he turns 92 , the eloquent legislator known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Senate rules and history surpasses Carl T. Hayden , the Arizona Democrat who served a total of 20,773 days in the U.S. House and Senate . With his 20,774 th day representing West Virginia -- six years in House and then nearly 51 years and counting in the Senate -- Byrd sets a record for longevity unlikely to be broken as the political climate turns toward term limits and growing public dissatisfaction with Congress . In a statement issued by his office , Byrd expressed his gratitude to `` the people of the great State of West Virginia '' for their long-standing confidence in him . His only regret , he said , was that his wife , Erma , who died in 2006 , would not be with him . `` I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear Robert -- but do n't let it go to your head , '' Byrd 's statement said . In a career representing the West Virginia coal-mining country from which he emerged , Byrd has cast more Senate votes -LRB- 18,000-plus -RRB- and held more leadership positions -LRB- including two stints as majority leader -RRB- than any other senator . He has never lost an election . He was raised by an aunt and uncle after his mother died when he was a year old , and he did not graduate college until he received a degree in 1994 from Marshall University . In a sign of his Appalachian roots , Byrd was an avid fiddle player and appeared twice on the television program `` Hee Haw . '' He gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands . His early political years displayed some of the deeply rooted racism of the American South . Byrd was a member of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s , and later called it `` the most egregious mistake I 've ever made . '' In 1964 , he voted against the Civil Rights Act pushed by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson . But Byrd later followed a more traditional Democratic path . An ardent foe of President George W. Bush 's policies in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Byrd opposed creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and called Bush `` dangerous , reckless and arrogant '' in February 2003 , six weeks before the Iraq war started . Three months later , he criticized Bush 's landing a jet on the USS Abraham Lincoln to signal the end of the Iraq war as `` flamboyant showmanship . '' On June 12 , 2006 , Byrd became the longest serving senator in history , and was re-elected to his ninth consecutive Senate term five months later . Things have changed since he arrived in Washington as a new congressman in 1953 , along with the first Eisenhower administration . Gas cost 20 cents a gallon then , and the average annual salary was less than $ 4,000 . Ten presidents later , Byrd is known for his devotion to his state and constituents . `` His number one priority has always been the people of West Virginia , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , says in a statement on Byrd 's Senate Web site . `` It has been a great example for all of us to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your state and the people in your state should have first priority . '' Byrd 's statement marking Wednesday 's achievement reflected that thinking . `` Although we are marking a longevity milestone , it has been the quality and dedication of service that has guided me over the years , '' Byrd said in his statement . `` I have strived to provide the people of West Virginia the best representation possible each of the 20,774 days which I have served in the Congress of the United States . '' He thanked his constituents for their support and for `` putting their trust and faith in me . '' Slowed by illness in recent years , including a six-week hospital stay this year because of a staph infection , Byrd concluded his statement with typical bravado . `` The only way for me to close on this historic day is to say that I look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days , '' he said . `` Thank you and may God bless you .

The patient himself expressed satisfaction . `` I feel like a million bucks , '' Kennedy said after the surgery , according to a family spokesperson . `` I think I 'll do that again tomorrow .

Kennedy 's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals , '' Dr. Allan Friedman said in a written statement issued after the procedure . `` Sen. Kennedy was awake during the resection , and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery . '' Friedman called the resection `` just the first step '' in Kennedy 's treatment plan , which is to include radiation and chemotherapy , to be carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . Paging Dr. Gupta Blog : Mapping Ted Kennedy 's brain The 76-year-old Massachusetts senator , patriarch of one of the leading families of American politics , said in a written statement earlier that he expected to remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery . He is also expected to undergo radiation and chemotherapy .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in Zimbabwe Monday failed to bring to court an opposition activist who was scheduled to become a government minister on Friday but was arrested instead . Zimbabwe police officers at Mutare Magistrates Court where Roy Bennett 's scheduled appearance was postponed . Roy Bennett of the Movement for Democratic Change was supposed to be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister last week under a power-sharing agreement between the MDC and President Robert Mugabe 's ZANU-PF party . Bennett was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism , sabotage and banditry . Police added another charge , contravening the Immigration Act , on the day he was scheduled to appear in court . They accuse Bennett of attempting to leave the country illegally . His party has decried the charges as `` trumped up . '' His lawyer said Monday 's court proceedings were canceled because prosecutors were unable to make it from the capital Harare to the court where the proceeding was to take place , in Mutare , 132 miles -LRB- 213 km -RRB- away . It is unclear why local prosecutors are not being used . Bennett 's lawyer Trust Maanda says he hopes his client will appear on Tuesday . `` He is doing fine considering the conditions of the cells he is being kept in , '' Maanda said . `` There is no food or running water , sanitation facilities are not working , the cells are overcrowded and there are no blankets . '' Bennett was arrested on Friday while on his way to South Africa , where he has been living for three years . Bennett , who is also the MDC party 's treasurer , was pulled from an aircraft at the airport in Zimbabwe 's capital , Harare , the MDC said . Police accuse him of funding the acquisition of weapons to commit the crimes he is charged with . Bennett , a white coffee grower , is an old foe of Mugabe 's government . His farms were seized during the country 's controversial land reform program . He has previously been jailed for assaulting Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa in parliament . The arrest happened the same day that other MDC ministers in the new unity government took their oaths of office . The power-sharing agreement came into effect only after months of on-again , off-again negotiations between Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980 , and the MDC , led by Morgan Tsvangirai . Under Mugabe 's government , the country has gone from being one of the breadbaskets of Africa to dire poverty . A cholera epidemic is raging , much of the population lacks adequate food and water , many public sector workers are on strike , and the country suffers such severe inflation it recently knocked 12 zeroes off its currency . -- CNN 's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The alleged victim in a 1977 sexual assault case against director Roman Polanski has filed court papers seeking dismissal of the charges against him . Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 . The woman 's declaration seeking dismissal was filed Monday in Los Angeles , California , in connection with Polanski 's efforts to have the 31-year-old case dismissed . Polanski , 75 , has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse . Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl , and an arrest warrant against him remains in effect . In her declaration , Samantha Geimer said , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , who has spoken publicly about the case before , including a 2003 appearance on CNN 's `` Larry King Live , '' added , `` I have survived , indeed prevailed , against whatever harm Mr. Polanski may have caused me as a child . '' She chided the district attorney 's office for not dismissing the case earlier and for `` yet once again -LRB- giving -RRB- great publicity to the lurid details of those events , for all to read again . True as they may be , the continued publication of those details cause harm to me ... I have become a victim of the actions of the District Attorney . '' The Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office had no immediate response to Geimer 's declaration . Lawyers for the Oscar-winning film director filed a motion for dismissal of the sex offense case against him in December , citing what the defense called `` extraordinary new evidence '' of `` repeated , unlawful and unethical misconduct '' by the Los Angeles district attorney 's office and the judge in Polanski 's case . The December motion also argued that Polanski should not be required to return to the United States to appear in court for the dismissal motion to be considered . In her declaration , Geimer said if Polanski can not appear in court , she will do so to seek dismissal . `` My position is absolutely clear , '' she said . Polanski 's motion for dismissal is scheduled for a hearing on January 21 . Polanski , a native of Poland , won the Academy Award in 2003 for his Holocaust drama , `` The Pianist . '' Among his other films from earlier in his career are `` Rosemary 's Baby '' and `` Chinatown . '' His first wife , actress Sharon Tate , was murdered by the Charles Manson family in 1969 .","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama 's senior economic adviser said Sunday the government was delaying a report to Congress in order to provide more time to address China 's alleged currency manipulation . Lawrence Summers , director of the National Economic Council , told the CNN program `` State of the Union '' that major international meetings coming up , including a G-20 economic gathering that will include China , provide the opportunity to resolve trade differences that could be exacerbated if the exchange-rate report were released on April 15 as scheduled . Summers said the upcoming meetings offer opportunities to engage China and other countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States . U.S Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner announced the delay of the report to Congress on Saturday . Many lawmakers had hoped the report would publicly admonish China for allegedly manipulating its currency to the detriment of the United States . Geithner , explaining the delay , said the upcoming meetings are `` the best avenue for advancing U.S. interests at this time . '' On Sunday , Summers denied that the delayed report had any connection to the U.S. desire for China to support tougher sanctions against Iran over the Tehran government 's refusal to comply with international regulations regarding its nuclear energy program . His comment was in response to a question on the ABC program `` This Week . '' China has opposed more sanctions , but last week signaled a willingness to negotiate the issue within the U.N. Security Council , according to Susan Rice , the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations . Lawmakers from both parties have called on the Obama administration to speak out against China 's refusal to let its currency appreciate . China has kept its yuan at about 6.83 to the dollar for almost two years . Many U.S. economists say the currency is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . Keeping its currency low makes China 's goods cheaper on the world market and more likely to be purchased by other countries . But , analysts say , it hurts American businesses , which can not compete . Some analysts have argued that this is costing the United States 1.5 million jobs and impeding the country 's economic recovery . `` Everyone knows China is manipulating the value of its currency to gain an unfair advantage in international trade , '' said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley , adding he was disappointed in the treasury secretary 's decision . `` If we want the Chinese to take us seriously , we need to be willing to say so in public , '' said Grassley , the ranking Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee . `` The past few years have proven that denying the problem does n't solve anything . '' Chinese officials have insisted the United States is using Beijing as a scapegoat for its own economic problems . `` The Chinese government will not succumb to foreign pressure to adjust our exchange rates , '' said Zhong Shan , vice minister of commerce , late last month . Premier Wen Jiabao has been equally stern in his response . `` We oppose the practice of finger-pointing among countries or strong-arm measures to force other countries to appreciate currencies , '' he told reporters last month . In his statement , Geithner acknowledged China has maintained an `` inflexible exchange rate . '' `` A move by China to a more market-oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing , '' he said . Rep. Sander Levin , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , said the delay was meant to see if the international community can address the issue in the coming months . `` If the multilateral effort does not result in China 's making significant changes , the administration and Congress will have no choice but to take appropriate action , '' said Levin , a Democratic lawmaker from Michigan .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was furious after his team 's hopes of retaining the English Premier League title were dented by a controversial 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Saturday . Demba Ba 's second-half penalty kept the visitors in fourth place despite having Jonas Gutierrez sent off with 11 minutes to play , and Manchester City can now move seven points clear at the top by winning at Liverpool on Sunday . Javier Hernandez put second-placed United ahead four minutes after the halftime break with a lucky goal when a volley by teammate Wayne Rooney hit visiting defender Steven Taylor and ricocheted into the net off the Mexico striker . Ba continued his hot scoring run , with the Senegalese striker netting his ninth league goal this season in the 64th minute as referee Mike Jones ruled that Rio Ferdinand fouled Hatem Ben Arfa -- but only after consulting with his linesman . Ferguson insisted the England defender had made a fair tackle . `` I think it was everyone 's view , including the referee as he thought Rio won the ball because he gave the corner kick , '' the Scot told reporters . `` He let the assistant referee over-rule him . `` We had that situation a few weeks ago when the linesman gave a penalty kick for handball against Sunderland when it was obviously an opponent 's hand . '' United hit the woodwork through England winger Ashley Young after Argentina international Gutierrez was dismissed for a second booking . Tottenham retained third place after winning 3-1 at West Bromwich Albion as Emmanuel Adebayor followed up his double against Aston Villa with two more goals to put his side two points behind United . The on-loan striker canceled out Youssouf Mulumbu 's early header when he was quickest to react after Ben Foster saved his 25th-minute penalty . Striker Jermain Defoe , handed a rare start in place of Rafael van der Vaart , put the London side ahead in the 81st minute after Adebayor helped put him clear with a backheel , then the Togo international sealed it in time added on from Gareth Bale 's cross . Fifth-placed Chelsea bounced back from successive defeats to beat Wolverhampton 3-0 and relieve the pressure on manager Andre Villas-Boas . The Portuguese has had to defend himself with Chelsea well off the pace and battling to stay in Europe after losing to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League in midweek . Captain John Terry headed the London side ahead in the seventh minute , while young striker Daniel Sturridge and Spain winger Juan Mata also scored before halftime to leave the visitors hovering above the relegation zone . Sixth-placed Arsenal failed to join Chelsea on 25 points after being held 1-1 by London rivals Fulham , who moved up to 15th . Thomas Vermaelen 's 65th-minute own-goal gave Fulham hope of a first win at the Emirates , but the Belgium defender made amends by heading an equalizer with eight minutes to play from Theo Walcott 's right-wing cross . Bolton remained third from bottom after a 2-0 home defeat by Everton . Bolton had David Wheater sent off after just 20 minutes before second-half goals from Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini and Greek forward Apostolos Vellios lifted the visitors up to eighth . Norwich moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at home to fellow promoted side Queens Park Rangers , as substitute striker Grant Holt scored a close-range decider with 17 minutes to play .

Wigan moved off the bottom with a last-gasp 2-1 win at Sunderland , the club 's second victory in 13 games . Franco di Santo profited from an injury-time error by former Manchester United defender Wes Brown , after Jordi Gomez 's 44th-minute penalty had canceled out Sebastian Larsson 's opener for the home side . The result left Blackburn at the foot of the table in seven points following a 3-1 defeat by Stoke in the early match .

{"answer":"Harare , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nestle , one of the world 's largest food companies , has reopened its factory in Zimbabwe after receiving assurances from the government that its business will not be interfered with again , an official with the Swiss-based company said Tuesday . The company shut its Harare factory last month , complaining of harassment by authorities after it refused to take milk supplies from a farm that had been taken over by President Robert Mugabe 's family as part of his controversial land reform program . `` On the basis of the written assurances given by the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Zimbabwe to guarantee the security of Nestle management and staff and not to interfere in the company 's operating processes , Nestle decided to restart the activities at its Harare factory , '' said Brinda Chiniah with Nestle Equatorial African Region 's corporate communications department . `` The company reiterates its commitment to source milk exclusively from its contracted farmers , '' Chiniah 's statement added . Minister of industry and commerce of Zimbabwe , Welshman Ncube , confirmed that he held meetings with Nestle management . `` I was assigned by my superiors to have meetings with them , and I assured them that their concerns will be addressed . We can not afford to lose investors at this stage when we are rebuilding the economy , '' Ncube said . The Nestle shutdown was seen by many as a setback to the country 's efforts to attract foreign investors to help shore up its battered economy . Operations were under way as normal at the Nestle plant in Harare on Tuesday . Nestle said last month its decision to shut the facility was prompted by an unannounced visit from government officials and police December 19 , after which the firm was forced to accept a milk delivery from non-contracted suppliers . Two of its managers , including expatriate managing director Heath Tilley , were questioned by police and released without charge the same day . Chiniah said Nestle had been in Zimbabwe for 50 years and employs more than 200 people in the southern African nation , adding that the company was `` working with the population of Zimbabwe and striving to maintain a long-term viable operation in often challenging conditions . `` We operate in Zimbabwe , as we do in every country , through good times and bad . We work for the long-term , in a way which has positive impact on our consumers , employees and suppliers , '' Chiniah said . Nestle stopped buying milk from Gushungo Dairy Estate , owned by Mugabe 's family , in October , following international criticism of a deal it had agreed to earlier in the year to use the farm as a supplier . The farm had been seized under Mugabe 's controversial land reform program , which targets mainly the properties of white farmers . Critics say Mugabe 's seizure of white-owned commercial farms to resettle landless black Zimbabweans -- who have no farming experience -- has ruined the country 's once-prosperous economy . Mugabe , in power since independence from Great Britain in 1980 , denies the charge , and says the economic crisis is due to sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to his land reform .","question":""}

'' Watch Obama speech With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Obama had 55 percent of the vote . Clinton was second with 27 percent , followed by Edwards , with 18 percent . Obama 's victory capped a heated contest in South Carolina , the first Democratic primary in the South and the first with a largely African-American electorate . Obama , who is hoping to become the the nation 's first African-American president , did well with black voters , who made up about half of Saturday 's electorate , according to exit polls . Black voters supported the Illinois senator by a margin of more than 4-to-1 over his nearest rival , exit polls indicate . Among white voters , Obama took about a quarter of the vote , with Clinton and Edwards roughly splitting the remainder , according to exit polls .

'' The state Democratic party estimated that more than 530,000 Democrats turned out for Saturday 's primary , as compared with 445,000 voters who showed up to vote last weekend in the state 's Republican primary . The Democratic numbers topped the GOP turnout for the first time since 1992 , when 445,000 Republicans turned out to renominate President George H.W. Bush .

'' As South Carolina 's Democratic primary voters went to the polls Saturday , almost half of them had made up their minds more than a month ago , according to exit polls . In the 2004 primary , nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support , but this year , only 10 percent of this year 's voters waited until Saturday to choose . Another 10 percent decided only in the last three days , and 32 percent decided in the last month . Forty-seven percent made up their minds at least a month ago , more than double the percentage of 2004 . The early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1,269 voters statewide . Following a rough campaign between Clinton and Obama , the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days , returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the Republicans rather than on each other . `` I think they -LSB- the Republicans -RSB- should be gracious and just say , `` We have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and ... we should n't be re-elected , ' but I do n't think that is what they are going to do , '' Clinton said . South Carolina is the last big test for the Democrats before Super Tuesday , February 5 , when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses -- including such delegate-rich states as California , New York , New Jersey and Illinois . Florida holds its primary on Tuesday but no Democratic delegates are being awarded there because the national party is penalizing the state for moving its primary up earlier in the year .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Philippines President Gloria Arroyo was stopped from boarding a plane at Manila 's Ninoy Aquino International Airport Tuesday , hours after the country 's Supreme Court overruled government-imposed restrictions on her travels . The Philippines government fears that Arroyo , who is facing allegations of corruption and electoral fraud , will flee if allowed to leave the country . But the Supreme Court ruled 8-5 in favor of a temporary restraining order on the travel ban , declaring it was unconstitutional as Arroyo has yet to be formally charged with a crime . A Supreme Court spokesman , Midas Marquez , told reporters the court 's ruling was `` consistent with the constitutional presumption of innocence . '' Arroyo was reportedly boarding the flight to seek medical treatment abroad for her bone disease diagnosed earlier this year , following three unsuccessful spinal operations in the Philippines . She arrived at the airport in an ambulance and was transported to the departure gate in a wheelchair while wearing a neck brace . Arroyo 's lawyer , Raul Lambino , told CNN that the former first couple was `` subjected to indignity and embarrassment at the airport '' , calling the government 's defiance of the Supreme Court order `` abhorrent and in violation of the rights of the individual guaranteed by the -LRB- Philippine 's -RRB- constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Van Johnson , whose boyish looks and earnest manner made him a Hollywood heartthrob in the 1940s and '50s , died Friday in an assisted-care facility , a friend told CNN . Van Johnson and Judy Garland in `` In the Good Old Summertime , '' one of many musicals in his lengthy career . Johnson , 92 , died around 11 a.m. of natural causes at the Tappan Zee Manor in Nyack , New York , where he had lived for seven years , said Wendy Bleiweiss . Johnson 's career stretched over six decades and across genres , from comedies and war films , such as `` The Caine Mutiny '' and `` 30 Seconds Over Tokyo , '' to Broadway musicals and television shows , including a guest spot as the Minstrel on the campy 1960s series , `` Batman , '' according to Turner Classic Movies ' Web site . The red-haired , freckle-faced actor 's youthful charm earned him a huge teen following in his heyday . He became known as the `` voiceless Sinatra , '' despite a singing voice that landed him roles alongside June Allyson and Judy Garland in `` Two Girls and a Sailor '' and `` In the Good Old Summertime , '' according to TCM.com . Johnson was born August 25 , 1916 , to a plumber and housewife in Newport , Rhode Island . He was 16 years old when he left Rhode Island for New York City so he could forge a career in acting , Bleiweiss said . A few years later , he got his break from Lucille Ball , she said . `` She saw this redhead kid and said , ` Let 's give him a break . He seems like he can do some acting , ' '' Bleiweiss said . Johnson made his Broadway debut in 1936 in `` New Faces of 1936 '' before legendary director-playwright George Abbott hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in Rodgers and Hart 's `` Too Many Girls '' in 1939 . The next year , Abbott cast him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly 's understudy in Rodgers and Hart 's groundbreaking musical `` Pal Joey , '' according to TCM.com . His film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of `` Too Many Girls . '' While en route to a screening in 1942 , he was in a car wreck that left him with a metal plate in his head and kept him out of the military . But that did n't stop him from acting in war films . Two years later , he received top billing in `` Two Girls and a Sailor . '' Other big roles included `` A Guy Named Joe , '' `` Brigadoon '' and `` The Caine Mutiny . '' In 1947 , Johnson married former actor Eve Lynn Johnson , who had previously been married to a close friend of Johnson 's , Keenan Wynn . The two did not have children and divorced in 1968 , according to TCM.com Johnson had a daughter , Schuyler Van Johnson , by another woman , according to TCM.com . As Johnson entered middle age , his features grew heavy but he still managed to find offbeat roles in films including `` The Bottom of the Bottle , '' an unabashed melodrama in which he played an alcoholic , and `` 23 Paces to Baker Street '' as a blind detective . As film roles became scarce , Johnson filled the gaps with stage work . He appeared in `` The Music Man '' in London , England , in 1961 and returned to Broadway in 1962 for `` Come on Strong . '' In Woody Allen 's 1985 comedy , `` The Purple Rose of Cairo , '' Johnson played one of the actors trapped inside the film screen in a parody of sorts of films from the 1930s . In 1987 , Johnson was praised for his work in the Broadway production of `` La Cage aux Folles . '' He last appeared on stage four years ago in `` Love Letters '' in a community theater in nearby Suffern , New York , but decided afterward that he would do no more , Bleiweiss said . `` He said he had seen it and done it all and now he was just going to sit back and take it easy . Those were his words , '' she said . Johnson retained much of his youthful energy as he grew older , and became a frequent interview subject on the old days of Hollywood and his lengthy career , TCM.com said . Bleiweiss said she met Johnson when he moved into the home , where she was a case manager at the time . `` He still was tall and striking , '' she said . `` He was one of the all-time old actors . '' His ability to communicate was hampered by the loss of his hearing . Instead , he passed the time by painting , needlepoint and crocheting , she said . Though he did n't cook , he loved watching cooking shows and reruns of `` The Golden Girls , '' she said . Bleiweiss said Johnson was estranged from his daughter and stepchildren for most of his life , but children brightened his day . `` When he saw them , he 'd smile and wave to them , '' she said . `` It always brought a smile to his face .

In early 2006 , Alomar submitted to an HIV test that , according to court papers , confirmed he was HIV positive in February 2006 . Dall says she went for an HIV test shortly afterward and the results were negative . The couple visited a disease specialist shortly after Alomar 's diagnosis , who found a mass in Alomar 's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS , according to the lawsuit . Dall alleges that a few days later , Alomar 's skin was turning purple and he was foaming at the mouth ; a spinal tap on February 21 , 2006 , confirmed he had full-blown AIDS , court papers said . Dall claims in the lawsuit that Alomar 's negligence caused her severe `` emotional distress '' over the health of her children . Court papers say that because the couple lived with the children , they may have been exposed to Alomar 's saliva or blood in the bathroom , through things like toothbrushes and other items . Dall claims to suffer from `` permanent emotional distress '' even after repeatedly testing negative for HIV . The lawsuit claims her fear of contracting the disease is known as `` AIDS phobia '' and that she suffers from permanent post-traumatic stress disorder . Alomar requested Tuesday that the suit be moved to Brooklyn , New York , federal court . It was originally filed in Supreme Court in Queens , New York . An initial conference on the case is expected on April 15 in Brooklyn federal court . Alomar is the son and brother of major leaguers -- father Sandy Alomar was a second baseman with several teams between 1964 and 1978 and brother Sandy Alomar Jr. is a former catcher who played from 1988 to 2007 . Roberto Alomar retired in 2004 with a .300 lifetime batting average , 12 All-Star game selections and 10 Gold Gloves . He was the All Star Game MVP in 1998 and played on two Toronto Blue Jays World Series champion teams . Alomar , then playing for the Baltimore Orioles , is also known for an incident in 1996 during a game against the Blue Jays when he spat in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck following a heated argument over a third strike . After the incident , Alomar claimed the umpire uttered a slur to him during the argument .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama will address the future of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Thursday morning in a speech at the National Archives . The Guantanamo facility houses terror suspects , and lawmakers do n't want them in the U.S. . In a speech that is being billed as a major address , Obama is also slated to discuss issues of state secrets , transparency and protecting national security , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . Former Vice President Dick Cheney , one of the most outspoken critics of Obama 's policies , is scheduled to give an opposing argument Thursday morning . Cheney has charged that Obama 's national security decisions have left the United States more vulnerable to attack . Obama 's address is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET at the National Archives . Cheney will speak before the conservative American Enterprise Institute at 10:45 a.m. Obama is hoping to rally support behind his national security measures after angering some with his decision to resume the Bush administration practice of military tribunals and by reversing course on his decision to release photos of alleged inmate abuse at Guantanamo . On Wednesday , Obama was dealt another blow when the U.S. Senate passed a measure that would prevent detainees at Guantanamo Bay from being transferred to the United States for now . The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in a 90-6 vote . A similar amendment has already passed the House . It was attached to a supplemental war funding bill . Following in the steps of House Democrats , Senate Democrats rejected on Tuesday the administration 's request for $ 80 million to close the Guantanamo facility . They instead asked that President Obama first submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the prison . Obama , in one of his first official duties as president , announced that he would close the prison by January 22 , 2010 . Congressional Democrats , however , are now attempting to avoid an onslaught of criticism from Republicans , who argue it would be reckless to shutter the prison before deciding where to transfer the detainees . FBI Director Robert Mueller told members of Congress earlier Wednesday that he is concerned about the potential dangers that may result from the release of detainees in the United States . In response to a question from Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , Mueller said he is concerned about the potential for fundraising to support terrorist groups and the radicalization of others , as well as the potential for attacks within the country . Mueller also said that while he is not concerned about dangerous terrorists escaping from maximum security federal prisons , he is concerned about the potential of activities being directed from within prison walls , and he cited such actions by dangerous gang members . Attorney General Eric Holder , the president 's point man overseeing the Guantanamo plan , sought to downplay the FBI director 's concerns and the Senate vote to bar funds . `` The concerns that have been expressed by the director and concerns expressed by other people will all be taken into account in formulating the plan that we will ultimately use , '' Holder told reporters late Wednesday . `` We 're not going to do anything that 's going to put the American people at risk , '' he said . The attorney general continued to express confidence that the Guantanamo Bay prison camp will be permanently closed by Obama 's deadline . iReport.com : Sound off on Obama , Cheney speeches `` We will have conversations with Congress , and I 'm confident that as a result of those conversations , the necessary funds will come our way , '' Holder said . At the White House , press secretary Robert Gibbs echoed Holder 's promise . `` The president understands that his most important job is to keep the American people safe and that he is not going to make any decision or any judgment that imperils the safety of the American people .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Besides charting the nature of space and time and penning the bestseller `` A Brief History of Time , '' Stephen Hawking has another distinction : He beat the life-expectancy odds for people with ALS , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Stephen Hawking , shown in Pasadena , California , in March , is hospitalized but said to be `` comfortable . '' Most people with ALS survive only two to five years after diagnosis . Hawking , on the other hand , has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease , which is also known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease in America and motor neuron disease , or MND , in the United Kingdom . Hawking , 67 , was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge , England , on Monday in a `` very ill '' condition , and spent the night in the hospital . He was said to be `` comfortable '' Tuesday . Bob Hawkins , 75 , of Fayetteville , North Carolina , who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year , said Hawking , with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer , gives him hope . The physicist should be a role model for people with the disease as well as those without it , Hawkins said . `` The man is brilliant , and he has striven through a lot of adversity to accomplish all of the things he has accomplished , '' Hawkins said . `` He should be an inspiration for anyone . '' The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest , said Dr. Lucie Bruijn , scientific director for the ALS Association , in an e-mail . This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association , she said . `` To have achieved so much in his lifetime while battling Lou Gehrig 's Disease is quite remarkable , '' she said . ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord , which results in muscle weakness and atrophy . The disease causes the death of motor neurons , meaning the brain loses its ability to control muscle movement . Hawking has had direct involvement in promoting awareness and research into his disease . He recently agreed to be a patron of the MND Association in Northampton , England , meaning he will lend his name to the charity and support it by attending events , fundraising , or other activities . He has participated in some of the organization 's high-profile events , said Mel Barry , communications manager at the MND Association . `` He 's a very busy man , so it 's wonderful that he 's publicly supporting us with his very heavy workload , '' she said . Hawking 's case is also unusual because his condition was diagnosed at a young age , said Sharon Matland , vice president of patient services at the ALS Association . People typically are between 40 and 70 when they learn they have ALS ; Hawking found out at age 21 . Some very rare cases manifest in the late teens , Bruijn said . There have been other rare cases of people living long lives with ALS , although none as famous as Hawking . Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years . ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States , the ALS Association estimates . `` It totally upsets your entire way of living , '' Hawkins of North Carolina said . `` It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected , your speech may or may not be affected . The only part of your body that is n't affected is your mind . '' Still , patients experience different symptoms , and some do have cognitive impairment , Matland said . They may have trouble making day-to-day decisions , such as choosing which bills to pay first . Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms , typical symptoms of the disease . People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet , Matland said . `` You drop things or you ca n't grasp things as you might have been able to do in the past , '' she said . Loss of voice is another potential symptom , but some people are able to speak until they die , Barry said . The nature of the disease is that it 's very different in each person , she said . Most people with ALS become dependent on a wheelchair -- sometimes within six to eight months , but the time frame varies , Matland said . Typically , the ultimate cause of death is respiratory failure , because ALS affects the muscles used for breathing , she said . David Niven , the English actor known for his roles in `` Around the World in 80 Days '' and `` The Pink Panther , '' died of ALS at age 73 . He suffered from the disease for more than a year . A variety of ongoing clinical trials seek to find an effective treatment for ALS in the U.S. Drugs in these trials include lithium , ceftriaxone , and memantine , according to the ALS Association . A recent study showed there may be a genetic component to the disease . In the UK , the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium , which has produced promising results in mice , Barry said . Psychiatrists currently prescribe lithium , a mood-stabilizing drug , for bipolar disorder and other conditions . An FDA-approved drug called riluzole has been shown to prolong survival for some ALS patients , but extends the life span by only three to six months , Barry said . Typically , palliative care is the main treatment -- managing symptoms rather than stopping or curing them . Stem cell therapy may hold promise for the disease , but the general perception is that research into it is not sufficiently advanced , according to the MND Association . To raise money for research in the U.S. , the ALS Association hosts walks across the country . Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville , North Carolina , Walk to Defeat ALS in May . `` I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is , and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects , '' he said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israel was founded on democratic principles with the Jewish state 's declaration of independence in 1948 including a commitment to the `` complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion , race or sex . '' It has remained a continuous democracy ever since . The 120-seat Knesset is the Israeli seat of government . The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset , the country 's national parliament , located in Jerusalem , which Israel claims as its capital . The Knesset 's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote . Knesset seats are divided according to each party 's proportion of the overall vote . But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat . Participation in elections , including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population , has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout , according to Israeli government figures . Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters . Israel usually holds national elections every four years . But this year 's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni 's failure to form a coalition . Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim . Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel ; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself . Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition . Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections , including major parties such as Kadima , Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties . The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel 's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition . The prime minister-designate then has 28 days , extendable by 14 days , to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members . Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The small Baltic nation of Estonia is ending its nearly six-year military operation in Iraq by not replacing its platoon of 34 troops . Estonian soldiers on patrol near Baghdad in 2004 . Estonia 's Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo said the country will not deploy its next infantry platoon to Iraq , according to a statement from the ministry . Platoon ESTPLA-18 was ready to replace the previous 34-man platoon which returned to Estonia from Iraq in late December , The Baltic Times reported . The Estonian defense ministry announced Thursday it had failed to reach an agreement with Iraq 's government about the troops ' legal status . Aaviksoo said the absence of a legal agreement `` specifying the legal status of our soldiers '' was one of three reasons Estonia ended its military operation in Iraq . He said the other two reasons were the improving security situation in Iraq and the Iraqi government 's desire to `` continue bilateral cooperation in forms other than battle units . '' A bilateral agreement spelling out future defense-related cooperation between Iraq and Estonia is still being hammered out , Aaviksoo said . Estonia will continue to participate in a NATO-led training mission in Iraq , with three staff officers , he said . The Estonian defense ministry said Aaviksoo will soon visit Iraq to formally terminate the Estonian Defense Forces ' operation and discuss future defense-related cooperation with his Iraqi counterpart , Abdul Al-Qadir Jassam . In late December , Iraq 's Presidency Council approved a resolution allowing non-U.S. troops to remain in the country after a U.N. mandate expired at the end of 2008 . The resolution authorized Iraq to negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries , including Estonia . If that resolution had not been approved by the end of the year , those countries would have been in Iraq illegally . The United States concluded a separate agreement in November with the Iraqi government authorizing the continued presence of its troops . U.S. combat forces plan to pull back from population centers in Iraq by July 2009 and to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011 . The British government says its forces will complete their mission of training Iraqi troops by May 31 , 2009 , and withdraw from the country by July 31 , 2009 . Britain has 4,100 troops in Iraq , the second-largest contingent after the United States with 142,500 . Australian troops also plan to be out of the country by the end of July .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is expected to ask the Obama administration for additional troops and equipment , according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's thinking . Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's report on the war 's status will be delivered in August , the source says . The request will be for troops and equipment for conducting intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , as well as more assets to deal with roadside bombs and explosives , said the official , who declined to be identified because McChrystal 's request has not been formally transmitted to the Pentagon . The request could be made in coming weeks after McChrystal completes a `` troop-to-task review '' to calculate whether there are enough U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- and the right mix of troops -- to carry out the military 's war plan at an acceptable level of risk , the official said . The review could also lead to a request for additional troops for either combat or training of Afghan forces , but the official emphasized McChrystal has not made a decision on that . The military already has tasked an additional 4,000 troops to train Afghan forces . The official said McChrystal is likely to submit his recommendations to Defense Secretary Robert Gates as a series of options , with each option having a level of risk attached to it . `` This will start the discussion '' within the highest levels of the administration about whether to send a significant number of additional troops , the official said . Gates has signaled he would be open to sending more troops if it could be demonstrated they are needed . But he also has expressed caution that the United States not send so many troops that it has too heavy a footprint in the country . The troop-to-task review will follow McChrystal 's assessment of the war , due 60 days after he took command in mid-June . That report is expected to be sent to Gates and NATO 's secretary general by August 14 , the official said . It will discuss a detailed strategy for success of the counterinsurgency mission , such as the need for U.S. and Afghan forces to conduct more integrated operations and the need to focus on population centers . It is also expected to call for an increase in the number of Afghan security forces . `` This will be a really frank and honest discussion of how things are , and what it takes to get the job done , '' the official said .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A suspect charged in the failed Times Square car bombing is a Pakistani who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009 and used to work as a financial analyst in Connecticut . Faisal Shahzad , 30 , most recently of Bridgeport , Connecticut , was arrested Monday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as his flight to Dubai was about to take off , law enforcement officials said . Federal authorities had put him on a no-fly list earlier in the day , with investigators having determined that he had purchased the vehicle used in Saturday 's failed bombing attempt , FBI Deputy Director John Pistole said Tuesday . Customs and Border Protection agents reacted quickly to the name match and made the arrest , Pistole said . Shahzad has been charged with five counts in connection with the case , according to documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York . According to the documents , he admitted to law enforcement officials that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan . Also according to the complaint , Shahzad returned to the United States via a one-way ticket from Pakistan on February 3 . He had told immigration officials upon his return that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months , the complaint said . Shahzad has a Karachi identification card , a sign of Pakistani residency , and his family is from northwestern Pakistan , according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik . His father is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force , Shahzad 's cousin , Kafayat Ali , said on Tuesday . The father , Bahar Ul Haq , a former air vice marshal , lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad in Pakistan . Shahzad came to the United States and attended college , earning a bachelor 's degree in computer applications and information systems from Connecticut 's University of Bridgeport in 2000 . He earned an MBA at the school in 2005 . He started working as a junior financial analyst for Affinion Media Group in Norwalk , Connecticut , in 2006 , leaving voluntarily in June 2009 , according to Affinion spokesman Michael Bush . Before what the court document says was Shahzad 's trip to Pakistan , he lived in Shelton , Connecticut . A woman who said she had lived next door to him in Shelton told CNN on Tuesday that the man she knew did n't say much and claimed to work on Wall Street in New York . `` He was quiet . He would wear all black and jog at night . He said he did n't like the sunlight , '' Brenda Thurman said . She said Shahzad , his wife and two children and his wife 's two sisters lived next to her for about three years , moving out in July 2009 . People whom she believes were plainclothes law enforcement officers appeared to be staking out the house Monday , Thurman told CNN affiliate WTNH-TV . The neighbor said she often saw Shahzad leaving the home in the morning and returning in the evening . She also saw him in his yard with his children , a boy and a girl , and the family usually wore traditional Muslim attire , she told WTNH-TV . She said she never suspected he might be involved in a possible terror attack . `` I did n't think he was capable of doing something like that . ... I 'm very shocked , '' she said . Thurman said her daughter often played with Shahzad 's daughter , but she herself did n't have much contact with the family . Shahzad 's wife spoke English , but was apparently so insecure about her language ability that she told people she did not , Thurman said . `` I never knew she spoke English until it was time for her to move , '' Thurman said . Shahzad 's wife told Thurman in July 2009 that the family was moving to Missouri . A few weeks after they left their home , the lender foreclosed on the property and changed the locks , the neighbor said . At the Bridgeport residence where authorities say he lived most recently , agents with the FBI and local police , including members of a bomb squad , conducted a search , and investigators removed filled plastic bags . Cell phone calls conducted for the purchase of the vehicle used in Saturday 's bombing attempt helped lead police to the suspect , law enforcement sources said . Sources said investigators got cell phone information from the daughter of the Nissan Pathfinder owner . She sold the vehicle to Shahzad on behalf of her father . She had been talking on the phone to Shahzad in arranging the purchase of the SUV , which was advertised for sale on Craigslist . The Nissan Pathfinder was parked in Times Square containing propane tanks , fertilizer and gasoline on Saturday night . After police retrieved the vehicle identification number of the Pathfinder , they located the registered owner of the vehicle . The sources said the owner 's daughter had met with Shahzad at a Stratford , Connecticut , grocery store , for the sale . Shahzad took the car for a test drive in the parking lot and bought the vehicle for $ 1,300 in cash .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Toyota Motor Corp. has recently been in the hot seat after issuing massive recalls because of problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models . To date , 8.1 million vehicles worldwide have been recalled by the manufacturer , with the possibility of more to come after Thursday 's announcement by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of a formal investigation into brake problems with the 2010 Prius . As the company 's woes continue to mount , there has been some speculation from critics such as Rep. Henry Waxman , D-California , as to whether Toyota 's recent problems with sudden unintended acceleration go beyond the problems already identified . Speaking on Wednesday to CNN 's Campbell Brown , Larry Webster of Popular Mechanics magazine spoke at length on the problem , saying that `` in the last decade , there have been tens of thousands of reports of sudden unintended acceleration in cars made by all the manufacturers . '' Is this true ? The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered : Which other car manufacturers have had a problem with sudden unintended acceleration ? \u2022 Sudden unintended acceleration occurs when a car continues to move forward , often at increasing speeds , without the driver pressing on the accelerator pedal . \u2022 While Toyota is basing its current recall on the possibility of floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator pedals , many factors can contribute to the problem of sudden unintended acceleration in vehicles . Reports from the NHTSA have blamed it on many other factors , including frayed throttle cables and cracked cruise-control computers . \u2022 The top five manufacturers of cars driven in the United States are General Motors , Toyota , Ford , Honda and Chrysler . \u2022 The NHTSA 's online database indicates that every one of these five has received numerous consumer complaints of sudden unintended acceleration in more than one of its models . Each manufacturer has faced a formal investigation into these complaints by the NHTSA and as a result has had to recall vehicles to fix various conditions that led to the problem . \u2022 Recalls due to incidents of sudden unintended acceleration are not limited to the big five manufacturers . According to the NHTSA database , recalls have also been issued for vehicles made by Nissan , BMW , Volkswagen , Mitsubishi , Subaru , Mercedes-Benz , Kia , Mazda , Land Rover , Suzuki and Volvo . \u2022 In December 2009 , Consumer Reports published an article that said 41 percent of the sudden acceleration complaints received by the NHTSA in 2008 pertained to Toyota and its luxury brand , Lexus . Ford came in second behind Toyota with 28 percent of the complaints relating to U.S. models . \u2022 Bottom Line : Sudden unintended acceleration is not a problem limited to Toyota . Many car manufacturers , including the other four with the largest shares of the U.S. market , have had to recall vehicles because of this issue .","question":""}

A new Jackson album -- a new Jackson appearance -- was a pop culture event . iReport : Share your memories of Michael Jackson The pop music landscape was changing , however , opening up for rap , hip-hop and what came to be called `` alternative '' -- and Jackson was seen as out of step . His next release , 1991 's `` Dangerous , '' debuted at No. 1 but `` only '' produced one top-ranking single -- `` Black or White '' -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending , in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch . And then `` Dangerous '' was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana 's `` Nevermind , '' an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics . After that , more attention was paid to Jackson 's private life than his music career , which faltered . A 1995 two-CD greatest hits , `` HIStory , '' sold relatively poorly , given the huge expense of Jackson 's recording contract : about 7 million copies , according to Recording Industry of America certifications . A 2001 album of new material , `` Invincible , '' did even worse . In 2005 , he went to trial on child-molestation charges . He was acquitted . In July 2008 , after three years away from the spotlight , Jackson announced a series of concerts at London 's O2 Arena as his `` curtain call . '' Some of the shows , initially scheduled to begin in July , were eventually postponed until 2010 . Watch the reaction to Jackson 's passing Rise to stardom Michael Jackson was born August 29 , 1958 , to Joe Jackson , a Gary , Indiana , steelworker , and his wife , Katherine . By the time he was 6 , he had joined his brothers in a musical group organized by his father , and by the time he was 10 , the group -- the Jackson 5 -- had been signed to Motown . Watch Michael Jackson 's life in video He made his first television appearance at age 11 . Jackson , a natural performer , soon became the group 's front man . Music critic Langdon Winner , reviewing the group 's first album , `` Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 , '' for Rolling Stone , praised Michael 's versatile singing and added , `` Who is this ` Diana Ross , ' anyway ? '' The group 's first four singles -- `` I Want You Back , '' `` ABC , '' `` The Love You Save '' and `` I 'll Be There '' -- went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart , the first time any group had pulled off that feat . There was even a Jackson 5 cartoon series on ABC . Watch reaction from Motown Studios '' In 1972 , he hit No. 1 as a solo artist with the song `` Ben . '' The group 's popularity waned as the '70s continued , and Michael eventually went solo full time . He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 movie version of `` The Wiz , '' and released the album `` Off the Wall '' in 1979 . Its success paved the way for `` Thriller , '' which eventually became the best-selling album in history , with 50 million copies sold worldwide . At that point , Michael Jackson became ubiquitous . Seven of `` Thriller 's '' nine cuts were released as singles ; all made the Top Ten . The then-new cable channel MTV , criticized for its almost exclusively white playlist , finally started playing Jackson 's videos . They aired incessantly , including a 14-minute minimovie of the title cut . -LRB- `` Weird Al '' Yankovic cemented his own stardom by lampooning Jackson 's song `` Beat It '' with a letter-perfect parody video . -RRB- On the Motown Records ' 25th-anniversary special -- a May 1983 TV extravaganza with notable turns by the Temptations , the Four Tops and Smokey Robinson -- it was Michael Jackson who stopped the show . Already he was the most popular musician in America , riding high with `` Thriller . '' But something about his electrifying performance of `` Billie Jean , '' complete with the patented backward dance moves , boosted his stardom to a new level . Watch Jackson perform `` Thiller '' '' People copied his Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved , zippered-jacket look . Showbiz veterans such as Fred Astaire praised his chops . He posed for photos with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the White House . Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets , two of which -- `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Say Say Say '' -- became top five hits . Jackson became a Pepsi spokesman , and when his hair caught fire while making a commercial , it was worldwide news . It all happened very fast -- within a couple years of the Motown special . But even at the time of the `` Motown 25 '' moonwalk , fame was old hat to Michael Jackson . He had n't even turned 25 himself , but he 'd been a star for more than half his life . He was given the nickname the `` King of Pop '' -- a spin on Elvis Presley 's status as `` the King of Rock 'n' Roll '' -- and few questioned the moniker . Relentless attention But , as the showbiz saying has it , when you 're on top of the world , there 's nowhere to go but down . The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real , some rumored -- as his music . As the Web site Allmusic.com notes , he was rumored to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber and to have purchased the bones of John Merrick , the `` Elephant Man . '' -LRB- Neither was true . -RRB- He did have a pet chimpanzee , Bubbles ; underwent a series of increasingly drastic plastic surgeries ; established an estate , Neverland , filled with zoo animals and amusement park rides ; and managed to purchase the Beatles catalog from under Paul McCartney 's nose , which displeased the ex-Beatle immensely . In 1990s and 2000s , Jackson found himself pasted across the media for his short-lived marriages , the first to Elvis Presley 's daughter , Lisa Marie ; his 2002 claim that then Sony Records head Tommy Mottola was racist ; his behavior and statements during a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir done for a documentary called `` Living With Michael Jackson ; '' his changing physical appearance ; and , above all , the accusations that he sexually molested young boys at Neverland . Watch report on legacy on Michael Jackson '' The first such accusation , in 1993 , resulted in a settlement to the 13-year-old accuser -LRB- rumored to be as high as $ 20 million -RRB- , though no criminal charges were filed , Allmusic.com notes . He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets . Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block . However , an auction of material from Neverland , scheduled for April , was called off and all items returned to Jackson . Interest in Jackson never faded , however , even if some of it was prurient . In 2008 , when he announced 10 comeback shows in London , beginning in July 2009 , the story made worldwide news . The number of concerts was later increased to 50 . Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March . However , when the shows were postponed until 2010 , rumors swept the Internet that Jackson was not physically prepared and possibly suffering from skin cancer . Watch discussion of his tough life , brilliant career '' At the time , the president and CEO of AEG Live , Randy Phillips , said , `` He 's as healthy as can be -- no health problems whatsoever . '' Jackson held open auditions for dancers in April in Los Angeles . He is survived by his three children , Prince Michael I , Paris and Prince Michael II .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq 's oil minister Monday opened international bidding on six oil fields that could increase the country 's oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day . Iraqi flags flutter during the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in the Shiite holy city of Najaf . But the oil ministry continues to negotiate short-term no-bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies , including Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell , Total SA , Chevron Corp. , and BP -- a step recently criticized by two U.S. lawmakers . Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani announced Monday that 35 international oil companies can bid on long-term contracts for redeveloping the six oil fields , as well as two natural gas fields . `` It is a unique event and a significant feature in the new Iraq that we declare the first bidding course for developing the Iraq oil fields publicly and fully in a transparent way , '' the minister said at Monday 's news conference . It marks the first time in more than 35 years that Iraq has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders . Shahrastani said the fee-based contracts will not give the winning companies a share in the revenue from oil sales `` because this wealth belong to Iraq only and thus we will not allow anyone to share the Iraqis ' oil . '' Iraq has among the largest oil reserves in the world , with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for the No. 2 status behind Saudi Arabia 's 264 billion barrels , according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration . Iraq 's current oil production is 2.25 million barrels a day , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . That is close to its status before the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 , but below its levels prior to the first Persian Gulf War in 1991 . The six oil fields that will be open to development are in the Kirkuk oil fields and the neighboring Bai Hassan fields in northern Iraq , Shahrastani said . They are al-Rumeila , al-Zubair , al-Qurna West , and three fields in the Maysan oil fields -- Bazirqan , Abu Gharab and Fakah . The two gas fields are Akas and Mansouriya gas fields in western Iraq . The fields have already been explored and are producing oil and gas , but the equipment is old and outdated , Shahrastani said . He hopes that the new infrastructure provided by the international oil companies will mean `` the production can be increased in less cost and less time . '' Iraq 's oil minister said the ministry will invite the 35 qualified international companies -- which includes BP , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron -- to prepare their bids over the next two weeks . The contracts could go into effect by next year , but Shahrastani said it will take several more years before oil production is increased . `` We hope in 2013 through this first bidding course to increase production in these fields by 1.5 million barrels per day , in addition to our daily average production rate during the last five years , '' he said . Meanwhile , Iraq hopes to wrap up its talks regarding short-term , no-bid contracts that would allow the U.S. and European oil companies -- including Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Total SA , Chevron , and BP -- to service those oil fields as soon as possible . Last week , Sen. Charles Schumer , D-New York , and Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing concerns about the no-bid contracts that the government of Iraq is negotiating with the U.S. and European companies . The senators , who released the letter , said they are worried that unfair distribution of oil revenue could inflame the violence between the warring religious and political groups of Iraq . `` We urge you to persuade the -LRB- government of Iraq -RRB- to refrain from signing contracts with multinational oil companies until a hydrocarbon law is in effect in Iraq , '' read the letter from Schumer and Kerry . `` At this time , the -LRB- government of Iraq -RRB- currently does not have in place a revenue-sharing law that could fairly allocate any revenue gained from Iraq 's lucrative hydrocarbon fields between the three major ethnic groups in Iraq , '' read the letter . `` We fear that any such agreements signed by Iraq 's Hydrocarbon Ministry without an equitable revenue-sharing agreement in place would simply add more fuel to Iraq 's civil war . '' In their letter , the senators said that Iraq 's oil revenue during 2007 and 2008 will total $ 100 billion , `` most of which will not be spent on reconstruction due to bureaucratic incompetence . '' The oil ministry said Monday that the negotiations over the no-bid `` technical support agreements '' are ongoing . Under those short-term agreements the companies would be paid a fee for extracting the oil , but would not get a share of the revenue from oil sales . The companies that will be allowed to compete in the open bidding for long-term contracts , which would be under a similar revenue format , are :","question":""}
{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A New York taxi driver pleaded guilty Friday to involvement in a plot to blow up crowded subway trains . After entering his plea Zarein Ahmedzay delivered a message : `` I strongly urge the American people to stop supporting the war against Islam , '' he said , adding , `` I am thankful for myself that I did not do anything to harm anyone but fear someone else will do the same thing . '' Prosecutors said Ahmedzay and another man , Adis Medunjanin , conspired with Najibullah Zazi on the attack in mid-September 2009 , which authorities thwarted . Zazi pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with authorities , investigators have said . Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty . During Ahmedzay 's hearing , prosecutors for the first time revealed the names of the two al Qaeda leaders who , officials said , ordered the plot : Saleh al-Somali , head of international operations for al Qaeda , and Rashid Rauf , a key operative . U.S. officials said both al Qaeda figures were killed in drone in attacks in Waziristan , the tribal region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan . Rauf was reported killed in a drone attack in Waziristan in November 2008 ; al-Somali was reported killed in December 2009 , U.S. officials said . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , in a written statement , said the facts disclosed Friday `` add chilling details to what we know was a deadly plot hatched by al Qaeda leaders overseas to kill scores of Americans in the New York City subway system in September 2009 . This plot , as well as others we have encountered , makes clear we face a continued threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates overseas . '' `` Prosecution underscores the importance of using every tool we have available to both disrupt plots against our nation and hold suspected terrorists accountable , '' Holder said . Ahmedzay previously pleaded not guilty to making false statements to the FBI about the plot . But Friday , appearing before before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven M. Gold in U.S. District Court , he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction against people in the United States ; conspiracy to commit murder ; and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization . Ahmedzay told the court that he , Zazi and a third man traveled to Pakistan in August 2008 to join jihadists fighting in Afghanistan , but they were turned away . But al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan told the group they would be more helpful to the jihad cause if they conducted suicide attacks in New York . `` We discussed the matter amongst ourselves , and we agreed to go forward with the plan , '' he said . `` I personally believed that conducting an operation in the United States would be the best way to end the wars . '' At one point , Ahmedzay said , he began to have second thoughts but ultimately committed to the plan . He said his primary input was to develop targets because he was a taxi driver and knew the city well . Eventually , the three settled on an attack on subway trains during the month of Ramadan , but abandoned that plan when they believed law enforcement was watching them . Ahmedzay concluded his statement to the court with his belief that `` Zionist Jews '' are `` the real enemies of this country '' who are `` destroying this country from within '' and `` want a permanent shadow government within the government of the United States . '' He faces a sentence of up to life in prison . He is scheduled to be sentenced at the end of July . `` Ahmedzay 's plea makes clear that he betrayed his adopted country and its people by providing support to al Qaeda and planning to bring deadly violence to New York , '' said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller in a written statement . Robert Gottlieb , attorney for Medunjanin , said Friday 's developments do not change his client 's plans to proceed to trial . `` The evidence and the facts as they pertain to him will come out in court , '' Gottlieb said . No trial date has been set for Medunjanin . CNN 's Jennifer Rizzo , Susan Candiotti and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Taliban in Pakistan have released a second audiotape purportedly containing the voice of their leader , Hakimullah Mehsud , who sources say was wounded in a suspected drone strike this week . The group also released an audiotape Friday , though CNN could not confirm that the voice on either tape belongs to Mehsud . It was unclear whether the first tape was recorded before or after Thursday 's drone strike , but the voice on the second tape announced the date as Saturday . `` Let me say this briefly , that I , Hakimullah Mehsud , today , on the 16th of January , with central spokesman Azam Tariq and Umar Khittab , want to give this message to all mujahedeen : that by the grace of Allah , I , Hakimullah Mehsud , am alive and in good health . Neither have I been martyred in a drone attack nor injured , '' the voice says on Saturday 's tape . Tariq , a Taliban spokesman , denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt . Tariq said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck . He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda . However , other Taliban and intelligence sources said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike . Tariq delivered both audiotapes to local journalists . On the tape released Friday , the voice says , `` The media right now is also part of the war . The enemy through the media wants to demoralize the Taliban . At times they spread the propaganda in the media that ` We have martyred Hakimullah . ' At other times they say , ` We have completed the operation in South Waziristan , ' but this will never happen . '' The drone strike hit a madrassa , or religious school , that local officials said had been converted into a militant training camp . Ten people were killed in the strike , Pakistani intelligence and local officials said . In the Friday tape , the speaker warns of what will happen if the drone strikes continue . `` I want to inform the Pakistani people that the drone attacks that take place in the tribal areas endanger the politics , well-being and sovereignty of Pakistan , '' the speaker says . `` From today onward , for any dangerous step that the Pakistani Taliban will take in Pakistan , those responsible will be Pakistan 's rulers , not the Taliban . This is because the Pakistani rulers want to spill the blood of the innocent -LSB- tribesmen -RSB- in exchange for dollars . '' The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones , or unmanned aircraft . The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft . Last week , the Taliban released a video showing Mehsud sitting next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi , the man who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at an eastern Afghan base December 30 . The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack . It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud 's predecessor , Baitullah Mehsud , who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year , according to al Qaeda 's commander of operations in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu Yazid . Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe , but not from the same family . CNN 's Pierre Bairin contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Civilian deaths in Afghanistan have risen sharply in the past year , largely due to more Taliban attacks and roadside bombings , U.N. officials said Sunday . NATO soldiers sit in their vehicle in an Afghan province freed from Taliban forces . Afghan civilian deaths jumped from 430 in the first six months of 2007 to 698 so far this year , an increase of 60 percent , said John Holmes , the United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs . `` It is clear that the international military forces are making every effort to minimize civilian casualties , '' Holmes said . `` Nevertheless , these problems are still there , and we need to deal with them and make sure that the safety of civilians comes first and international humanitarian law is respected , '' he said . Taliban insurgents forces have shifted from direct attacks on international troops toward the use of `` civilian-blind '' measures such as roadside bombings and suicide attacks , said Aleem Siddique , a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan . At the same time , he said , civilian deaths blamed on government forces and U.S. and NATO troops has declined in the first six months of 2008 , largely due to pressure from Afghan President Hamid Karzai . About 60 percent of civilian deaths in 2008 are blamed on anti-government forces , up from less than half in 2007 . Increased Taliban attacks on aid projects also have left 78 of Afghanistan 's 398 districts off-limits to relief workers , Siddique said . `` Increasingly , we 're seeing targets of schools , of radio stations , of health clinics -- all in an effort to halt progress and keep people in fear , '' he said . A total of 565 aid convoys came under attack in 2007 , with hundreds of tons of food hijacked . As recently as Sunday , a convoy of 100 tons of food aid came under attack outside Kandahar , with several trucks burned and looted , he said . `` Thankfully , we 're not getting any report of death or injuries , '' he said . Afghanistan is the original front in the `` war on terrorism , '' which was launched after al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington . A U.S.-led invasion after the attacks pushed out the Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but the Islamic fundamentalist militia has regrouped along and across the mountainous border with Pakistan . Coinciding with the rise in civilian deaths in 2008 is an increase in attacks on American and allied forces , which are up 40 percent since last year The death toll of U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan in June also climbed to more than 40 , making it the deadliest month since the war began . An explosion in southern Afghanistan killed a British soldier serving with NATO on Saturday , the British Defense Ministry said Sunday . The soldier died when he was struck by a mine in Lashkar Gah , the capital city of Helmand province , the ministry said . He and his unit were investigating a report of a rocket-propelled grenade attack on a civilian aircraft at a nearby airfield , it said . `` When investigating this , they dismounted their vehicles and what is believed to have been a legacy anti-Personnel mine detonated , killing the soldier instantly , '' the ministry statement said . Most of the soldiers serving in Helmand are British . Helmand province is Afghanistan 's top poppy-producing region and a major front in the war against the Taliban . Provincial authorities there have blamed militants for a spate of recent deadly attacks . NATO and Afghan force operations kept the insurgency down in 2007 by killing or capturing key leaders and clearing out Taliban safe havens , but a Pentagon report issued last week predicted the Taliban would be back in 2008 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in the death of a 20-year-old pregnant Marine will be returned to North Carolina to face charges in her slaying , a Mexican judge ruled Thursday , according to North Carolina authorities . U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean was arrested in Mexico in April . U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , 21 , who was arrested in Mexico in April , could be returned to Onslow County , North Carolina , within a week , the county sheriff 's office said in a statement issued Thursday . Federal authorities will handle his transportation to the North Carolina jail . Laurean has been indicted on first-degree murder and other charges in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach . Her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean 's backyard near Camp Lejeune , where both were stationed , in January , a month after she was last seen . Prosecutors allege that Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico to avoid prosecution . Laurean was arrested in April in San Juan Vina , in the Mexican state of Michoacan . Because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico , he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process , authorities said . Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach , Laurean said , `` I loved her . '' As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean , authorities seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Laurean 's wife , Christina , was using to communicate with him , a law enforcement official had said . If convicted , Onslow County prosecutors said , Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole . Mexico 's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over . Authorities found Lauterbach 's body after Christina Laurean produced a note her husband had written claiming that the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument , according to officials . Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach 's neck , autopsy results indicate that the wound itself would not have been fatal . Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach 's slaying before she gave the note to authorities . Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her , and it is unclear whether he was the father of her fetus , although her relatives have said they believe him to be . He had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with her . Mary Lauterbach , the young woman 's mother , has said she 's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter 's rape allegation and other allegations of `` harassment '' seriously . Her daughter 's car was keyed , she said , and she was assaulted . `` Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them , '' she said Friday . In a statement issued after her death , the Marine Corps said Laurean 's denial `` was believed to be significant evidence . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Washington Wizards point guard Gilbert Arenas pleaded guilty Friday to illegally possessing an unlicensed handgun in the District of Columbia in a locker-room incident last month . The 28-year-old NBA all-star told Superior Court Judge Robert E. Morin that he understood he could receive up to five years in prison when he is sentenced on March 26 . But Arenas ' attorney , Kenneth Wainstein , told the court that the government will ask for no more than six months , under the terms of a plea agreement . `` He accepted full responsibility for his actions , acknowledged that those actions were wrong and against the law , and has apologized to all who have been affected by his conduct , '' Wainstein said in a written statement . The government has agreed to limit its recommendation to the low end of the guidelines -- `` estimated to be between six and 24 months , with probation , a split sentence , or incarceration permissible , '' U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips said in a written statement . `` Playing with firearms is no joke , '' said Phillips . `` Such reckless action can always be expected to garner a swift and firm response from this office . We commend Mr. Arenas for accepting responsibility and hope he fully appreciates the gravity of his actions . '' The government statement said the incident was traced to a flight from Phoenix , Arizona , on December 19 , when Arenas and a fellow teammate `` became involved in a verbal exchange after a card game . '' `` Although Arenas maintains that the statements he made during this exchange were made in jest , the exchange between Arenas and the teammate involved mutual threats to shoot one another , '' it said . `` Arenas also told the teammate that he would burn the teammate 's Cadillac Escalade . '' Two days later , Arenas entered the team 's locker room at the Verizon Center carrying at least one firearm in his backpack , the statement said . `` Once Arenas entered the locker room , he placed four firearms on the chair located directly in front of the locker of the teammate with whom he had the prior verbal exchange . Arenas then wrote the message ` PICK 1 ' on a piece of paper , and placed it on the teammate 's chair near the firearms . Arenas remained in the locker room . `` Moments later , the teammate walked into the locker room and approached his locker . He saw the handguns and he and Arenas once again exchanged words . During this exchange , Arenas stated , ` You said you were going to shoot me , so I thought you would like some firepower . Pick one . ' The teammate picked up one of Arenas 's firearms from his chair , threw it across the locker room , then reportedly took out what appeared to Arenas to be a silver-colored semi-automatic handgun . `` After this exchange , Arenas admitted to team management that he brought the firearms from his home in Virginia into Washington , D.C. . He also told team management that the teammate also had a firearm . The teammate has since denied that he ever had a handgun . Team management directed Washington Wizards security personnel to secure Arenas 's firearms and to remove them from the premises . '' The incident came to light on December 24 , when authorities were notified , the statement said . Metropolitan police went to Arenas ' home in Virginia , where the athlete 's four unloaded firearms -- a .50 - caliber gold-plated , semi-automatic Desert Eagle with magazine ; a .500 Magnum Smith & Wesson revolver ; a .45 - caliber black , semi-automatic Kimber Eclipse with magazine ; and a 9-mm Browning with magazine -- were surrendered , it said . The three-time NBA All-Star said he told authorities that he had stored the guns in his locker in the Verizon Center to keep them away from his children . `` I brought them without any ammunition into the District of Columbia , mistakenly believing that the recent change in the D.C. gun laws allowed a person to store unloaded guns in the District , '' Arenas said in his statement . He offered a public apology at the time to the league , his teammates and his fans , saying , `` I promise to do better in the future . '' During Friday 's court proceeding , the usually jocular Arenas appeared somber . Dressed in a dark pinstripe suit , he neither smiled nor spoke as he entered and left the courthouse . The judge ordered him to surrender his passport and said he could not possess any firearms while he awaits sentencing . Arenas ' indefinite suspension remains in effect until a separate NBA investigation is complete and Commissioner David Stern reaches a decision on whether to reinstate him , a source said Thursday . The league investigation , which had been on hold at the request of federal prosecutors , will now resume , the source told CNN . In a statement this month , Arenas described the incident as `` a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate , '' and said , `` Contrary to some press accounts , I never threatened or assaulted anyone with the guns and never pointed them at anyone . Joke or not , I now recognize that what I did was a mistake and was wrong . '' Citing NBA sources , the New York Post reported in December that the teammate who allegedly also brandished a firearm was Javaris Crittenton . Crittenton 's agent , Mark Bartelstein , has told CNN that his client `` has n't done anything wrong . I 'm extremely confident he 'll be exonerated .

{"answer":"EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Space shuttle Atlantis landed Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base after rainy weather in Florida precluded a landing at Kennedy Space Center . The space shuttle Atlantis touches down at Edwards AFB on Sunday . The shuttle touched down at 8:39 a.m. PT at Edwards , about 100 miles north of Los Angeles , California . Within seven to 10 days , the shuttle will be transported from California to Florida on the back of a modified 747 jumbo jet , NASA said in a statement . Atlantis ' next flight is scheduled for November . Rainy weather postponed the shuttle landing both Friday and Saturday . NASA had said that Atlantis conceivably could have remained in space until Monday , but wanted to land the shuttle Sunday . Watch Atlantis land at Edwards Air Force Base '' Weather conditions in Florida were better Sunday than Saturday , NASA officials said , but atmospheric conditions were still too unstable for a landing at Kennedy . It was the 53rd time the shuttle has landed at Edwards , NASA officials said . In the early days of the space shuttle program , Edwards was its primary landing site . Shuttles have landed 70 times at Kennedy Space Center , NASA said , and once at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico . Atlantis launched May 11 for NASA 's final repair visit to the Hubble Space Telescope . Shuttle astronauts conducted five spacewalks during the mission to perform routine repairs and replace key instruments , in what has been called one of the most ambitious space repair efforts ever attempted . Hubble was released back into orbit Tuesday morning . The telescope was rejuvenated with instruments designed to improve its capabilities by as much as 70 times , while extending its lifetime through at least 2014 , according to the NASA statement . `` This is not the end of the story but the beginning of another chapter of discovery by Hubble , '' Ed Weiler , associate administrator for science at NASA headquarters , said in the statement . `` Hubble will be more powerful than ever , continue to surprise , enlighten and inspire us all , and pave the way for the next generation of observatories . '' Hubble , which has been in space for nearly two decades , can capture clear images that telescopes on Earth can not , partly because it does not have to gaze through murky atmospheres .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former President Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala faces money-laundering charges in the United States , according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday . The indictment charges Portillo with embezzling tens of millions of dollars in public funds , `` a portion of which he then laundered through bank accounts located , among other places , in the United States and Europe , '' the indictment says . A grand jury indicted Portillo in U.S. District Court in New York . Portillo engineered an embezzlement with co-conspirators that occurred from about 2000 through about 2003 , the indictment says . Prosecutors allege the money-laundering took place through at least 2006 . Portillo was the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004 . Authorities in Guatemala started searching for him after the United States requested his extradition , a spokesman for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Sunday . They executed search warrants in four locations but had not found him as of Sunday night , officials said . Portillo came into power promising to clean up corruption , but found his own government mired in the same accusations as his predecessors . According to the indictment , in one instance in 2000 , Portillo funneled $ 1.5 million worth of donations for a literacy project from Taiwan into accounts in Europe controlled by his ex-wife and daughter . In that case , the indictment alleges , Portillo endorsed three $ 500,000 checks destined for a program to purchase books for libraries , but diverted the funds into a bank in Miami , Florida . That money was eventually laundered into his family 's accounts in Europe , the court document states . In short , `` this money was diverted , in a series of transactions and transfers designed to conceal the sources and origin of the funds , '' the indictment states . There was a second instance where Portillo allegedly embezzled money given to Guatemala by the Taiwanese , according to the document . In addition , Portillo is accused of embezzling money from his defense ministry in 2001 . With the help of others , Portillo made large cash transactions that ended up in accounts belonging to him and his co-conspirators , the document says . Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars , the indictment says .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. soldier convicted of murdering an Iraqi family spoke out for the first time Thursday , issuing a public apology for his crimes . Former U.S. soldier Steven Green got life in prison after being convicted of murdering four Iraqis . Steven Green , who escaped the death penalty this month , told relatives of the victims that he is `` truly sorry for what I did in Iraq . '' `` I helped to destroy a family and end the lives of four of my fellow human beings , and I wish that I could take it back , but I can not , '' Green said , reading a statement at a victim impact hearing . `` And , as inadequate as this apology is , it is all I can give you . '' The family refused to accept the apology . Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14-year-old girl and murdering her , her parents and her 6-year-old sister in the town of Yusufiya , about 20 miles south of Baghdad , in 2006 . A jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty , which means the judge is required under law to impose a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole . Green will be sentenced September 4 , but the victim impact hearing was held Thursday so surviving members of the al-Janabi family could testify before they return to Iraq . They decried Green 's sentence and testified about how the heinous crime had shattered their lives and how it will haunt them always . Green said that he knows `` you wish I was dead , and I do not hold that against you . If I was in your place , I am convinced beyond any doubt that I would feel the same way . '' He added , `` I know that I have done evil , and I fear that the wrath of the Lord will come upon me on that day . But , I hope that you and your family at least can find some comfort in God 's justice . '' The wailing family matriarch , Hajia al-Janabi , lunged at Green as she left the witness stand , denouncing him as a coward , a criminal and a stigma on the United States , according to Louisville 's Courier-Journal newspaper . Security officers restrained the distressed woman , the newspaper said . Another family member , Mahdi al-Janabi , said Green had lost the ability to distinguish between terrorists and Iraqi civilians . Green was tried in a civilian court in Paducah , Kentucky , because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes surfaced . He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division , based at Fort Campbell , Kentucky , to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up . The others -- Spec . James Barker , Sgt. Paul Cortez , Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard -- received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years , with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases . Green said he now sees the Iraq war as `` intrinsically evil , because killing is intrinsically evil . '' He was sorry , he said , that he ever had anything to do with either .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lionel Messi produced a performance of stunning brilliance , scoring all four goals as holders Barcelona beat Arsenal 4-1 to reach the semifinals of the Champions League 6-3 on aggregate on Tuesday . Messi turned on the style in the Nou Camp with one of the most devastating individual displays the competition has ever seen , as an injury-ravaged Arsenal side were torn apart . The match started started brightly for the Londoners who actually took a shock 18th-minute lead . Theo Walcott 's pace had troubled Barca in the 2-2 first leg at The Emirates and the England winger created the opener with a break down the right . His pass inside for Nicklas Bendtner was a poor one , but somehow the Dane managed to pounce at the second attempt to stab his shot past Victor Valdes in the Barca goal . Arsenal 's lead lasted barely three minutes before Messi began his one-man show . Mickael Silvestre failed to clear the ball on the edge of the area and it fell to Messi , who curled home a superb equalizer . Messi added his and Barca 's second on 37 minutes . Eric Abidal 's cross from the right was cut out by Thomas Vermaelen . However , the rest of the Arsenal defense were slow to react and Pedro found Messi , who smashed his shot past Manuel Almunia . The striker completed his stunning hat-trick four minutes before the break when he raced onto a header from Abidal to sprint clear of the Arsenal defense before superbly chipping the ball over Almunia . By now , Arsenal needed two goals to go through and , in truth , they never looked likely to get them . Bendtner struck the post with a fierce header from Gael Clichy 's cross , but he was flagged offside , and Tomas Rosicky fired over the bar when in a great position . Messi completed the job three minutes from time , beating two defender on the left hand side of the area before firing the ball through Almunia 's legs . The result means Barcelona will now face Italian champions Inter Milan , who they were drawn against in the group stages , in a mouth-watering semifinal clash . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was full of praise for Messi 's performance . `` For me , he is the best player in the world , and by a distance , '' he told Sky Sports . `` When he 's in the game , he 's really dangerous . Once he is on the run with the ball , he is unstoppable . The Frenchman added : `` I believe that we lost against a team that is better than us and have the best player in the world .

{"answer":"NEW YORK -- For more than 10 years , Mandy Hughes drifted in an out of what she calls the horrible , debilitating pain of Lyme disease . Mandy Hughes says the pain she suffered for more than 10 years was due to Lyme disease `` It literally feels like you got into a severe accident , like you were hit by a Mack truck and you were allowed no medical attention , '' she says . After being bitten by a tick at 19 , Hughes broke out in hives and suffered fever and chills so severe that she had to be hospitalized . She was diagnosed with Lyme disease and was sent home with two weeks ' worth of the antibiotic tetracycline . She seemed to be cured . But over the years , the Lyme symptoms flared back -- crippling joint pain , muscle spasms , headaches and facial paralysis . She visited 15 doctors , yet they were unable to arrive at a diagnosis . Several thought she had multiple sclerosis . Others knew she was sick but did n't know why . Lyme had been ruled out . `` Maybe it 's psychological -- we do n't really have an explanation , '' they told Hughes . `` Your tests are coming back fine , Mandy . '' Watch a report on a 10-year battle with Lyme disease symptoms '' The memory of one doctor 's visit stays with her to this day . She went to see him with joint pain so severe , she said , her hands were curled into a palsy-like position . Yet the doctor seemed impatient with her . `` You 're obviously an attractive woman , and you 're just trying to get attention , '' she recalls him saying . In 2005 , Hughes went to see what some patients refer to as a `` Lyme-literate '' doctor -- one willing to diagnose chronic Lyme disease and prescribe a long-term regimen of intravenous as well as oral antibiotics . Within three months , she began to feel better . After 15 months , she was back on her feet , but had to abruptly halt treatment when her doctor was sued by an insurance company and stopped seeing patients . Learn more about Lyme disease '' Hughes ' story is featured in a new documentary called `` Under Our Skin , '' which takes a look at the leaders of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , a national medical group that represents health care professionals who specialize in infectious diseases . The society 's purpose , according to its Web site , is to improve health care in areas related to such diseases . In particular , the documentary takes aim at the 14-member panel that wrote the 2006 Lyme disease treatment guidelines . The guidelines question the existence of chronic Lyme disease and claim the post-treatment symptoms of some patients appear to be `` more related to the aches and pains of daily living rather than to either Lyme disease or a tickborne coinfection . '' The guidelines list specific criteria for diagnosing Lyme -- such as an obvious tick bite , a characteristic bull 's - eye rash at the site of the bite , facial paralysis and a positive blood test . Yet some Lyme specialists say many patients experiencing symptoms do not see or remember a tick bite . Only 70 to 80 percent get the rash at all , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The longer the disease goes undiagnosed , the harder it is to treat , some doctors say . `` The disability associated with Lyme disease is worse than the disability that you might see with someone after a heart attack , '' said Brian Fallon , director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York . Patient advocates criticize the IDSA for recommending no more than a month 's worth of antibiotics to treat Lyme . They say insurance companies use the guidelines to deny payment for long-term antibiotic therapy . But the IDSA says there are inherent risks from such treatment , including localized infection from the IV line and the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria . One IDSA critic , Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , conducted an antitrust investigation of the guideline process , saying the panel ignored or minimized other medical opinions regarding chronic Lyme disease . Blumenthal said the process was tainted by conflict of interest because members of the panel consulted for insurance companies and at least one had a patent for a Lyme disease treatment . Gary Wormser , chief of infectious diseases at New York Medical College and one of the guidelines ' authors , denies those allegations , calling them `` preposterous . '' `` What we did recommend was not treating with unsafe or prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy , '' Wormser said . In a settlement with Blumenthal , the IDSA agreed to reassess its 2006 guidelines with the assistance of an outside arbiter . The heart of the debate is whether patients actually have Lyme disease , or simply symptoms that are mistaken for Lyme disease . `` The problem is that the majority of patients that carry the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease actually have the same kinds of symptoms : fatigue , musculoskeletal pain , sometimes brain fog . ... The majority of such patients actually do n't have any evidence of ever having had Lyme disease . '' Wormser said . There 's a lot at stake . The CDC reports approximately 20,000 new cases of Lyme disease a year , with the number doubling from 1991 to 2005 . Factoring in underreported cases , the CDC says the actual number could be three to 10 times higher . `` We have an epidemic of Lyme disease , '' said Daniel Cameron , president of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society , which rejects the IDSA guidelines and says the chronic form of the disease may be prevalent in up to 62 percent of the population in areas where Lyme disease is endemic . Fallon says standard blood tests fail to detect the Lyme infection in 20 to 30 percent of patients . `` Most reasonable academic physicians throughout the United States would acknowledge that there 's a large number of patients out there who do have chronic , persistent symptoms . The question is , why do they have those symptoms ? '' he says .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A small plane headed from New Jersey to suburban Atlanta crashed onto an interstate shortly after takeoff Tuesday , killing five people , authorities said . Two men , one woman , two children and a dog aboard the plane died in the crash in Morristown , New Jersey , just after 10 a.m. ET , said Robert Gretz , a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board . The plane , a six-seater Socata TBM700 , was headed from Teterboro , New Jersey , to DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in suburban Atlanta when it crashed onto Interstate 287 about 14 minutes into the flight , Gretz said . The plane was at about 17,500 feet when `` there was some discussion between the pilot and the controller of locations of icing conditions , '' he said . He told reporters Monday night the conversation seemed `` routine '' and was `` not a distress call . '' Gretz said he did not know whether the conversation concerned a cloud that might contain ice ; actual icing on the airplane ; or whether the pilot was inquiring where ice might be or reporting it . `` I 've heard this thirdhand . ... That 's something I need to listen to the tapes to know , '' he said . Gretz said he was not aware of any icing conditions on the ground at Teterboro that would have required the plane to be deiced . However , he stressed that the investigation is in its infancy and it is too soon to speculate what might have caused the crash . `` It 's too early to tell whether it was something mechanical or something the pilot did -- we just do n't know , '' he said . Preliminary information is that the five were headed to Atlanta for a combination business-leisure trip , Gretz said . Authorities did not release the names of those who died , pending positive identification by the medical examiner and notification of relatives . But New York investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. reported that those on board were two of the firm 's managing directors , Jeffrey Buckalew , 45 , and Rakesh Chawla , 36 ; Buckalew 's wife , Corinne , and their two children , Jackson and Meriwether . Ages for the children were not given . `` The plane belonged to Mr. Buckalew , an experienced pilot whose passion was flying , '' the company said in a statement . `` The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff 's family . '' No one on the ground was injured , although a pickup truck narrowly missed the plane , Gretz said . The debris field from the crash was spread over about a half-mile , with part of a wing and the plane 's tail found in a tree in a residential area , he said . Witnesses reported the plane was in an `` uncontrolled spin '' before it crashed . A Federal Aviation Administration radar facility in New York lost radio contact with the plane , and also lost it on radar , FAA spokesman Jim Peters said . The crash site was about 30 miles southwest of the Teterboro airport , Peters said . Gretz said Monday evening he was not sure how long after the conversation regarding icing that the plane dropped off radar , saying investigators will be determining that . The plane struck the southbound lanes of I-287 , continued through a wooded median and came to rest on the northbound lanes , New Jersey State Police Lt. Stephen Jones said . Most of the interstate was shut down after the crash , Jones said . One northbound lane and two southbound lanes were open as of Tuesday afternoon , but officials were `` still trying to recover both the pieces of the plane and the remains of the victims . '' Gretz said Monday night the wreckage recovery was halted about 6 p.m. because of darkness and would resume after Tuesday 's morning rush hour , at 9:30 a.m. . The New Jersey Department of Transportation said motorists had two of three travel lanes in each direction available for Monday evening 's rush hour .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Launched in 1995 , the Airbus A330-200 is the newest member of the European aircraft manufacturer 's twinjet family . The incident involves an Air France Airbus A330-200 . With a range of 12,500 km -LRB- 6,750 nautical miles -RRB- and the capacity to carry 253 passengers , the A330-200 is extremely well-regarded as a medium to long-range airliner . There are 600 currently in service with 82 airlines , including Air France , worldwide . Airbus has a further 300 orders for the aircraft . According to aviation expert Kieran Daly , the A330-200 is a `` reliable , ultra-modern , state-of-the-art airplane , '' with an impeccable safety record . He told CNN that there has only been one reported incident when an aircraft of this type has crashed . `` The incident took place in 1994 before the aircraft came into service , '' he said . `` It was being flown in test-mode by pilots who were putting it through some extreme maneuvers before it came down . `` Therefore the crash was not caused by the plane itself . `` It is very well-designed and well-equipped , with equally modern and reliable General Electric CF-6 engines . '' Air France has said that Flight AF 447 sent an automatic signal indicating electrical problems while going through strong turbulence early in its 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris . Why it took so long to report the aircraft missing '' However , Daly said that it would take extremely violent weather conditions to cause the catastrophic failure of an aircraft of this size . `` These planes are extremely robust and widely used on transatlantic routes and across Asia , '' he said . `` They are equipped with an array of sophisticated communication equipment , so it must have been something extremely sudden to cause the loss of contact . '' There has also been speculation that the Paris-bound flight was struck by lightning , but that should not bring down a modern airliner , former Airbus pilot John Wiley told CNN . According to Air France , the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330\/A340 aircraft . Of the two first officers , one had flown 3,000 flight hours -LRB- 800 of which on the Airbus A330\/A340 -RRB- and the other 6,600 -LRB- 2,600 on the Airbus A330\/A340 -RRB- . The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005 . Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009 . The larger A330-300 aircraft from Airbus entered service in 1993 and has a capacity of up to 335 passengers . It too has an impressive safety record , despite a couple of incidents in the last 10 years . In August 2001 , a Canadian airliner operated by Air Transat experienced double engine failure while traveling to Portugal . Miraculously the captain was able to perform an emergency landing in the Azores by gliding the powerless plane for almost 18 minutes . Last year , an A330-303 was forced to make an emergency landing in Australia after a sudden change in altitude injured 74 passengers . Qantas Flight 72 was flying from Singapore to the western Australian city of Perth when a sudden change of altitude caused abrasions , contusions , fractures and other injuries .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former mayor of a city in southeast Wisconsin pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of child pornography , solicitation of a minor and related counts , a prosecutor said . Gary Becker , former mayor of Racine , Wisconsin , is charged with soliciting someone he believed was a girl . Former Racine Mayor Gary Becker , who was arraigned Tuesday , could face a sentence of up to 164 years if convicted on all counts , District Attorney Michael Nieskes told CNN . He was still in office when he was arrested last month at a shopping mall in Brookfield , Wisconsin . He allegedly tried to meet with a person he thought was a 14-year-old girl after chatting with that person online , said Bill Kosh , a spokesman for the Wisconsin attorney general 's office . An officer posed online as the underage girl , according to authorities . Becker 's attorney did not immediately return calls for comment . Authorities first launched an investigation after Becker brought his personal computer into the mayor 's office for repair . The computer technician hired by his office discovered six pornographic images of girls `` possibly under the age of 18 years , '' according to Wisconsin criminal complaint . The technician reported his findings to local law enforcement officers , and they turned the case over to the state 's child Internet crimes task force . Members of the task force swapped out the computer 's hard drive so they could investigate without alerting Becker , Nieskes said . Their search uncovered further pornographic images of underage girls and more than 1,800 online chats containing `` sexually explicit comments , '' some of them directed at underage girls , the complaint says . Authorities then set up an online profile for the fictitious 14-year-old girl -- using the name `` Hopeyoulikeme14 '' -- and engaged the mayor in a chat that lasted more than two hours , the complaint says . During the chat , the former mayor agreed to meet the girl at a shopping mall , the document says . Becker , who resigned from office after his arrest , faces six criminal counts : child enticement , possession of child pornography , exposing a child to harmful materials , attempted second-degree sexual assault of a child , use of a computer to facilitate a child sex crime and misconduct in public office , according to a January statement from the Wisconsin Department of Justice .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Headley , the Chicago , Illinois , man appearing in court Wednesday in connection with terror attacks in India , was born Daood Gilani , the son of a prominent Pakistani broadcaster , according to his half-brother . He grew up in both the United States and Pakistan , with a parent from each country . Headley 's father , Syed Saleem Gilani , was working for the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America when Headley was born in 1960 in Washington , his half-brother Danyal Gilani said in a statement . Headley 's mother was American , and his parents divorced after they moved to Pakistan together , not long after Headley was born , his half-brother said . He did not name the mother . His mother returned to the United States , but Headley remained in Pakistan , his half-brother said , citing `` family elders . '' Headley went to high school at the Hassan Abdal Cadet College in Pakistan , Gilani and an FBI complaint against Headley indicate . At some point after high school , Headley moved back to the United States to be with his mother , and has had little contact with his Pakistani family since then , Gilani said . Gilani last saw Headley , whom he still refers to as Daood , `` when he visited Pakistan a few days after my father 's death , nearly a year ago . '' He got a Social Security number in Pennsylvania sometime in the late 1970s , public records show . He changed his name from Daood Gilani to David Headley on or about February 15 , 2006 , in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in order to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani , according to the criminal complaint against him . `` His having another name or changing his name at some stage in life has come as a surprise to me . He has four kids and a Pakistani wife who also live in the United States , '' said Danyal Gilani , a public relations officer for the Pakistani prime minister 's office . He issued a long statement last month distancing himself from his half-brother , in response to reports in the Indian press trying to link Headley to Pakistan 's prime minister , whose last name also is Gilani . But Danyal Gilani said his family was not related to the prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani . Headley was arrested by federal agents on October 3 in Chicago , accused of helping plan terror attacks against a Danish newspaper that ran cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , sparking Muslim anger worldwide . He was later linked to the bloody four-day terrorist siege in Mumbai , India , in November 2008 in which 160 people were killed . The Justice Department accuses him of attending terrorism training camps in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003 , and working with the group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to carry out terror attacks . The United States lists Lashkar as a terrorist organization . India blamed the group for the Mumbai attacks . At the time of his arrest October 3 , Headley was on his way back to India to plan a second attack , a source close to the investigation said . Headley is cooperating with the authorities investigating both terror plots , the Justice Department has said . His lawyer did not dispute that . Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed , a retired major in the Pakistani military , was also charged with conspiracy in planning to attack the Danish newspaper . So was Tahawwur Hussain Rana , whom U.S. authorities identify as a Pakistani native and Canadian citizen who lives mainly in Chicago . Headley said he worked for First World Immigration Services , a company owned by Rana , though authorities have said in court papers that surveillance showed that he `` performs few services '' for the company .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man police say kidnapped and brutally murdered a 7-year-old Georgia girl pleaded guilty Tuesday and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Ryan Brunn entered the plea at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse , during which he described in detail how he enticed , molested and killed Jorelys Rivera . The girl 's mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing on December 2 from an apartment complex in Canton , which is about 40 miles north of Atlanta . Brunn , 20 , who worked as a maintenance man at the same apartment complex , was arrested on December 7 and charged with the crime . He told the court he had never talked to Jorelys before the day of her murder . He said he devised a plan after he found one of her skates . Brunn took a picture of the skate and approached her with it , asking if the skate was hers . She said yes , and Brunn promised to take her to it . Instead , he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants . He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor . At this point , she was still alive , he told the court . So Brunn took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate . He said he did not have sex with the girl . Next , Brunn put Jorelys ' body in a plastic bag and loaded it into his maintenance golf cart . He put the body in the trash compactor and operated the machine . He then went home and hung out with friends . Later , he again operated the compactor . Increasingly , Brunn told the court , he grew concerned about what he had done . So he took a receipt , wrote on the back of it , `` She is in the trash can , '' and taped it to the compactor . He admitted lying to investigators who had questioned him about the case . Brunn said he knew right from wrong . During his testimony , relatives of the slain girl were visibly upset , crying and shaking . `` I would like to apologize for everything I have done , '' Brunn told her family in court . Last week , he was indicted on 13 counts including murder , aggravated assault , cruelty to children , aggravated child molestation , enticing a child for indecent purposes , false imprisonment , abandonment of a dead body , making a false statement and sexual exploitation of children . According to the indictment , Jorelys was severely beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the face , neck and chest . Brunn 's attorney had said previously he planned to plead not guilty . Brunn had no known criminal history , authorities have said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` A calculated , cold-blooded predator . '' That was how Connecticut Judge James Bentivegna described a then 22-year-old Joshua Komisarjevsky on December 20 , 2002 , when the defendant was sentenced after being convicted on 12 counts of burglary . Today , Komisarjevsky -- now 31 -- sits in a Connecticut courtroom , where a jury will weigh his guilt on murder charges , and potentially pave the way for a death sentence . Prosecutors say that on July 23 , 2007 , Komisarjevsky and an accomplice , Steven Hayes , invaded the home of Dr. William Petit , raped and strangled his wife , Jennifer Hawke-Petit , molested one of their daughters , and set the house on fire before attempting to flee . Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit -- died in the invasion of their Cheshire , Connecticut , home . Dr. William Petit , although severely beaten , managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor 's residence . Hayes was sentenced to death in December , after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths . Both suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the Petit invasion . Komisarjevsky 's long rap sheet , in particular , suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth . Officials with the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to speak with CNN , citing a gag order in the case . But over 200 pages of Komisarjevsky 's parole records have been released , which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused . One of his former attorneys , William Gerace , said that Komisarjevsky came from a close , religious family . But at the age of 14 , he began using drugs -- the same year , he claims , that he found out that he was adopted . By 18 , Komisarjevsky had found his drugs of choice : crystal meth and cocaine . He told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit . Yet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints Komisarjevsky as more than just the average thief . According to a police statement read aloud in court that day , Komisarjevsky admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old . `` I always wore gloves , with the exception of one incident when I was 14 . I always acted alone . Approximately a year and a half ago , I acquired night vision goggles ... I used the night-vision equipment during the burglaries -LRB- over -RRB- the past year , '' he said , according to the transcript . Gerace , who was Komisarjevsky 's defense attorney at the time , stressed that a need for money , to pay for drugs , drove his client . But he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual . `` Ninety-nine percent of burglaries are -LRB- committed by -RRB- junkies -- there 's nothing romantic about what they do , '' said Gerace . `` That was the first time I 'd seen something as exotic as that . '' Komisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial . They said his affinity for breaking into people 's homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation , since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home . Speaking during his December 2002 sentencing , Komisarjevsky appeared repentant . He addressed the court saying , `` I 've turned my back on my faith in God and my family . And in doing so , I fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs ... the crimes I committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders . '' But the judge was not moved by Komisarjevsky 's show of remorse , sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole , which has greater restrictions than typical probation . In April 2007 , he was paroled . And three months later , Komisarjevsky was arrested for the Petit home invasion and murders . What happened then , and what may have driven Komisarjevsky , remains a mystery to Gerace , his former attorney . `` He was a very complex young man . I do n't think I 've met anyone quite that complex , and I sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with , '' Gerace said . `` I wish him well , and I hope the jury makes the right decision .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rafael Nadal must get past big-serving home hope Andy Roddick to have a shot at his first title in 11 months at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami . The Spanish fourth seed crushed No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-3 6-2 on Wednesday night to move into the semifinals of the ATP Tour event , which has already seen top-ranked Roger Federer , Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray fall by the wayside . Sixth seed Roddick is hoping to repeat his 2004 victory , with the American in similarly dominant form as he dispatched Nadal 's 33rd-seeded compatriot Nicolas Almagro 6-3 6-3 . Nadal , twice a losing finalist in the southern American city , also reached the last four at Indian Wells two weeks ago on his return from a knee injury . `` When you play against Andy , it always is a big challenge , '' he told the ATP Tour Web site . `` His serve , and he 's a very good competitor . He 's a winner . Gon na be a very tough match , no ? I think I have to play my best tennis to try to win . '' Roddick , who has not dropped a set so far , will take on a player who will return to No. 3 in the world rankings next week following defending champion Murray 's second-round exit . He reached the final at Indian Wells before losing to Nadal 's conqueror Ivan Ljubicic , and was also a semifinalist in Miami in 2008 . `` Sometimes when you 're not playing well , everything feels a little bit forced . When you play a lot of matches and play a high level , it feels like everything kind of slows down a little bit , '' he told the ATP site . `` Muscle memory takes over a little bit more , and things kind of just happen . So I think I 'm at that stage right now . `` Unfortunately with tennis you have to start every day and it 's a new one . You 're playing well , but you still have to go out and do it every day . '' In Thursday 's quarterfinals , fifth seed Robin Soderling of Sweden takes on No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny of Russia . Czech 16th seed Tomas Berdych , who knocked out Federer on Wednesday , will play Spanish No. 10 Fernando Verdasco .

Even though I was a bit tired in the end , I was able to win . In terms of my fighting spirit , I proved I can still do it . That was important for me . '' Clijsters , the 14th seed , defeated No. 9 Samantha Stosur of Australia 6-3 7-5 as she broke to love in the 11th game and then served out for victory . `` Kim and I grew up together , arrived on the tour at the same time , played well at the same time , retired at the same time , and now we came back at the same time . It 's amazing , '' Clijsters said . `` We have never stopped respecting each other . Never , ever , ever . Even if people talk about it , we never had any problems , Kim and I.

{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Charges relating to Michael Jackson 's death will be filed Monday , prosecutors said . Friday 's announcement by the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office did not say what the charges would be or who would be charged Dr. Conrad Murray , Jackson 's personal physician when he died last summer , had planned to surrender to authorities Friday afternoon at the Los Angeles courthouse branch near Los Angeles International Airport , but that changed when prosecutors delayed filing charges . Murray 's lawyer , Ed Chernoff , then told reporters he and Murray would instead be in a public park near the courthouse Friday afternoon to talk about the case . That event was soon canceled . `` In light of the district attorney 's office announcement that Dr. Murray will be charged on Monday , we have canceled media access until after arraignment , '' Chernoff said in a written statement . Murray 's lawyers and prosecutors had been negotiating Thursday to have Murray turn himself in , but those negotiations broke down , a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the talks told Beth Karas of `` In Session , '' on CNN sister network truTV . `` I do n't know what part of negotiations could have broken down , in light of the fact that we 've placed ourselves in the hands of law enforcement to surrender at any time , '' said Ed Chernoff , Murray 's lawyer . Los Angeles prosecutors could file charges at any time , however , setting up a scenario for Los Angeles police to find Murray on their own , arrest him and take him to jail . A surrender -- in which a defendant turns himself in at a police station for booking -- would allow the doctor to avoid being seen in public handcuffed and escorted by police . Chernoff said earlier Thursday that he and Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney David Walgren `` share the goal of the efficient administration of this process . '' `` An arrest of Dr. Murray would be a waste of money , time and resources , '' Chernoff said . `` We 've always made it clear : You tell us where ; we 'll be there . I 'm sure something can be arranged . '' The doctor traveled to Los Angeles last week from his home in Houston , Texas , in expectation of possible charges . Murray was hired last spring as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts in London , England . The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson through the early morning hours of June 25 in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep , according to a police affidavit . He administered sleep aids , and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours , Murray said , he left the bedroom for `` about two minutes maximum , '' the affidavit said . `` Upon his return , Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing , '' it said . The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him from his $ 100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills to UCLA Medical Center . Efforts at CPR proved fruitless , and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. . The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson 's death a homicide resulting from a combination of drugs , primarily propofol and lorazepam . The coroner 's statement said Jackson died from `` acute propofol intoxication , '' but there were `` other conditions contributing to death : benzodiazepine effect . '' Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines . The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing , a police affidavit said . Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer 's death . The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol , the generic name for Diprivan , diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip . The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it . During the two nights before Jackson 's death , Murray said , he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep .

{"answer":"VIENNA , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The acting chief financial officer of mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac was found dead Wednesday morning at his home , police said . David Kellermann , acting CFO of Freddie Mac , was found dead on Wednesday , police said . David Kellermann was found dead of an apparent hanging , a source familiar with the investigation told CNN . There were no signs of foul play when officers arrived at the home in Vienna shortly before 5 a.m. , said Lucy Caldwell , a spokeswoman for police in Fairfax County , Virginia . She said the death `` may have been an apparent suicide . '' A second Fairfax County police spokesman , Eddie Azcarate , said Kellermann 's body was found in the basement . `` The exact cause of death ... we 're going to wait for the medical examiner , '' he said . Police were called by someone inside the home , he said , but he did n't know who made the report . Watch why police do n't suspect foul play '' Family members remained in the home , and several visitors went inside . Freddie Mac has been immersed in financial problems since last year , when the government took it over in the midst of the escalating subprime-mortgage loan crisis . Federal prosecutors in New York and Virginia have been investigating it , as has the Securities and Exchange Commission , according to a March 11 company filing . Sharon McHale , Freddie Mac 's vice president for public relations , issued a statement at midday , saying , `` Freddie Mac knows of no connection between David Kellermann 's death and the regulatory inquiries that were discussed in our recent SEC filing . '' Neighbors indicated there was no sign that Kellermann had problems . `` They were very friendly with all the young families in the neighborhood ... terrific people , '' said neighbor Paul Unger . `` We saw him when he was out working in the yard . ... We did n't spend a lot of time together . '' `` We 're beyond shocked , '' he said . `` He was a great family guy with a beautiful young child . '' They had the most decorated home at Christmas , Unger added . `` I can not imagine what has happened . ... This is a nightmare . '' `` I asked the policeman what was going on and he told me . I was stunned , silent , shed tears . I feel terrible , '' Unger said . `` This is a solid , salt-of-earth kind of family ... and I just can not imagine what would have driven him to it . '' Another neighbor said the family was very `` community-oriented , '' and liked hosting parties at their house . `` We 're very , very upset right now , '' said the woman , whose daughter baby-sat for the Kellermanns ' 5-year-old daughter . `` This is just too much for us . '' `` They were a very happy , happy couple . So it was a shock when we came upon it . '' Kellermann , 41 , was a man `` of great talents , '' Freddie Mac 's interim CEO , John Koskinen , said in a written statement . `` He dedicated those talents to Freddie Mac for more than 16 years , serving in many business and finance capacities before recently taking the reins as acting chief financial officer . `` His extraordinary work ethic and integrity inspired all who worked with him . But he will be most remembered for his affability , his personal warmth , his sense of humor and his quick wit . '' Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner offered his condolences in a written statement : `` On behalf of the Treasury family , we are deeply saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann 's death . Our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at Freddie Mac during this difficult time . '' Freddie Mac was established by Congress in 1970 to provide liquidity , stability and affordability to the nation 's residential mortgage markets . It supports communities across the nation by providing mortgage capital to lenders . Kellermann , who served as a senior vice president in addition to acting CFO , was named to those posts in September . He was responsible for the company 's financial controls . This included overseeing financial reporting , compliance with tax requirements and regulations , and annual budgeting and financial planning . Before assuming his current posts , Kellermann was corporate controller and principal accounting officer . According to the March 11 company filing , Freddie Mac was subpoenaed for documents relating to accounting , disclosure and corporate governance matters in September , October , January and February . The filing also says that SEC staff was interviewing company employees . The government took over Freddie Mac last year . In September , it and Fannie Mae were placed under conservatorship by their regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Both companies back mortgages held by private homeowners , and have received massive cash infusions from the government to keep them afloat . Kellermann held a master 's degree in finance from George Washington University and a bachelor 's in political science and accounting from the University of Michigan . He had served as a volunteer board member of the District of Columbia Coalition for the Homeless . `` We at -LSB- the Federal Housing Finance Agency -RSB- are very saddened by the death of David Kellermann , '' the agency said in a written statement . `` As the acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac during particularly challenging times , David was an inspiration to his staff and many others who were privileged to work with him . '' A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment . As part of its rescue of Freddie and Fannie last year , the government made $ 100 billion available to each to cover future losses -- amounts that President Obama has since doubled . In March , Freddie reported that it had asked the government for $ 30.8 billion after losing $ 50 billion in 2008 . Nearly the entire loss came in the second half of the year , following the government takeover , and the company 's losses deepened as the housing market continued its decline .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are likely to be two hot-button issues in Judge Sonia Sotomayor 's Supreme Court confirmation hearings as senators gauge not only her positions but also some controversial comments she has made . Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic woman to serve on the Supreme Court . Issue No. 1 : Abortion . It is the traditional hot-button issue in Supreme Court confirmation hearings . In a CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken May 14-17 , 68 percent of Americans say they do n't want the court 's Roe vs. Wade decision giving constitutional protection to abortion rights overturned . The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points . Sotomayor was raised Catholic . If she is confirmed , six out of the nine justices on the high court will be from the faith . Catholics make up about 25 percent of the U.S. population . Of the 110 people who have served on the Supreme Court , 11 have been Catholic . Five of those justices -- Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts -- are currently on the court . Read more about the justices on the court '' Barbara Perry , a government professor at Sweetbriar College , said she sees Catholics as swing voters with a base of socially conservative principles , and therefore attractive for Republican presidents . Catholic League President Bill Donohue said Catholics have conservative credentials on issues such as abortion , without the political baggage of terms such as the `` religious right '' or `` evangelicals . '' `` Is it safer to nominate a Catholic as opposed to an evangelical to get votes ? I think the answer is decidedly yes . '' Court observers wonder what , if anything , six Catholic justices would mean for Supreme Court decisions . The five Catholics on the bench concurred in a 2007 decision , Gonzales v. Carhart , which upheld a state ban on late-term abortions . Sotomayor has faced few abortion cases , and no tests on issues such as gay rights or the death penalty . However , Donohue expects a Justice Sotomayor to lean more left than her fellow Catholics on the court . Watch more on the issues confronting Sotomayor '' `` I think she 's more reliably liberal , '' Donohue said . Issue No. 2 : Same-sex marriage . Four states -- Connecticut , Iowa , Maine and Massachusetts -- allow same-sex couples to wed. . New Hampshire could soon follow with legislation pending before the state Legislature . Vermont has also legalized same-sex marriage . Same-sex couples in California , however , suffered a defeat Tuesday when California 's Supreme Court upheld the Proposition 8 ballot initiative in 2009 that outlawed same-sex marriage . The state had previously allowed such marriages after the same court ruled that , `` An individual 's sexual orientation -- like a person 's race or gender -- does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights . '' On Tuesday the court said : `` Our role is limited to interpreting and applying the principles and rules embodied in the California Constitution , setting aside our own personal beliefs and values . '' Recent CNN polling has shown that a majority of Americans are against legal recognition of same-sex marriage . Fifty-four percent of Americans questioned in an April 23-26 CNN\/Opinion Research Corp. poll said marriages between gay or lesbian couples should not be recognized as valid , while 44 percent said they should be considered legal . But there was a gap between the opinions of younger and older people , with younger people far more likely to approve of same-sex marriage . In fact , 58 percent of people age 18 to 34 said same-sex marriages should be legal . Among people ages 35 to 49 , 42 percent agreed , as did 41 percent of 50 - to 64-year-olds . Twenty-four percent of people 65 and older agreed . The survey 's sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points . But is marriage a right under the federal Constitution ? The federal courts have not ruled on that . `` That 's an issue that may well come up within the federal courts ... almost certain to do so , '' Justice Samuel Alito has said . Will Sotomayor set aside her personal beliefs and values ? Maybe . A recent clip of Sotomayor has surfaced that is being used by opponents to prove their belief she will rule a certain way . `` The court of appeals is where policy is made . And I know , I know that this is on tape , and I should never say that . Because we do n't make law , I know , '' she said at a 2005 conference at Duke University . `` OK , I know , I know . I 'm not promoting it , and I 'm not advocating it . '' Read about Sotomayor 's key rulings '' Another comment that could be scrutinized during the Senate hearings is from 2001 , when Sotomayor said the gender and ethnicity of judges does and should influence decisions . `` I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life , '' she said . That comment has outraged conservative critics such as the group Judicial Watch , which said that if confirmed , Sotomayor may rule more on the basis of racial identity than law . `` It is outrageous and racist on its face , and if a nominee that had conservative credentials made a similar although reverse statement they would be laughed at . They would never be put on the court , '' said Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch . But one liberal academic said too much is made of these comments and not enough of Sotomayor 's legal opinions . `` I do n't think having a particular background is going to cash out as having a particular ready style or opinion , '' said New York University Professor Kenji Yoshino . `` If you actually read over 400 opinions that she has written , you will see she is a judge 's judge . '' One case that will get greater scrutiny is Sotomayor 's role in dismissing the appeal of 19 white and one Latino firefighters from New Haven , Connecticut . They claim they were denied a promotion despite doing better on exams , because not enough minority candidates qualified . Sotomayor was one of a three-judge panel who in a one-paragraph summary sided with a lower court . Other judges on the court criticized the decision , arguing it failed to grapple with questions of exceptional importance . `` In a case like this where there are important competing concerns , it is important for the appellate court to explain the basis of her decision , '' said Case Western Reserve University professor Jonathan Adler . He said it was as if the court wanted to `` make the case go away or brush it under the rug . '' The Supreme Court decided it would hear the firefighters ' appeal . Legal analysts said they expect Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee will want to ask Sotomayor about her role in that case , as well as her comments about ethnicity and the bench . That , coupled with her views on abortion and same-sex marriage , could electrify an already heated debate over her nomination . Soon there will be even more known about Sotomayor . Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , and Jeff Sessions of Alabama , the committee 's ranking Republican , on Wednesday released the bipartisan questionnaire the Senate Judiciary Committee has asked Sotomayor to complete . Once the questionnaire is completed and returned to the committee , copies will be made available online and in print . CNN 's Lisa Dejardins contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Shoe prints left behind at the scene of several church fires in east Texas , as well as surveillance tapes and witness accounts , led police to two men now charged in one blaze and suspected in a string of others , according to court documents . Jason Robert Bourque , 19 , and Daniel George McAllister , 21 , are charged with one count of arson each in connection with a February 8 fire at Dover Baptist Church in Tyler , Texas . The blaze was one of 10 church fires in east Texas this year . Nine have been ruled arson , and authorities have said they believe Bourque and McAllister are responsible for them . Both men appeared in court Monday in Tyler and are being held on $ 10 million bond . A federal law enforcement source told CNN that multiple pieces of evidence have been linked to one of the suspects through DNA , and that many of the fires were ignited the same way . A resident called 911 at 8:45 p.m. after seeing smoke rising from the sanctuary at Dover Baptist Church , according to probable cause affidavits . As firefighters battled the blaze , a second fire was reported at 9:44 p.m. at Clear Spring Missionary Baptist Church in Lindale , Texas , about 15 miles northwest of Tyler . At Dover Baptist , someone apparently kicked in a rear door and threw a rock through a window , according to the affidavits . A Red Wing brand boot print was found on the door . It 's the same brand of boot that authorities believe left prints at previous church fires and attempted church break-ins in three counties . A print from a Skechers shoe also was found at several fire and attempted break-in locations , the affidavits said . Police obtained a surveillance tape from a gas station near Dover Baptist , the documents said . `` Subsequent review of this video revealed individuals known ... as Jason Robert Bourque and Daniel George McAllister were present at said location close to the same time the fire at Dover Baptist Church was discovered . '' A second surveillance tape , from a store near Clear Spring Missionary Baptist , shows someone police believe is Bourque walking inside at about 10:35 p.m. , according to the affidavit . Witnesses told police they saw a dark blue or purple four-door car parked next to the Clear Spring Church before the fire . A second sighting of such a car was reported on the same road where the church is located , the documents said . One witness said he saw the driver was a white male wearing a T-shirt and tried to flag him down , but the vehicle sped away . On February 11 , agents from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives contacted Bourque at his Lindale home , following up on a tip they received that he was involved in several of the church arsons , the affidavit said . Bourque agreed to talk with authorities , and they checked his blue 2008 Ford Focus , the documents said . The affidavits do not divulge what , if anything , Bourque told the agents . While agents were at Bourque 's home , his grandmother backed out of the garage and left the door open . The agents saw a muddy pair of Skechers shoes inside , the affidavit said . Agents believe the sole pattern on the shoes is consistent with the prints found near the churches . Authorities contacted a member of McAllister 's family , who told them he wears a size 13 or 14 boot , the documents said . A family member was shown a Red Wing boot and said the sole was the same as McAllister 's , except his boots were more worn . The relative took McAllister to the Greyhound Bus Station in Dallas , Texas , on February 10 where he purchased a one-way ticket to San Antonio , Texas , the affidavit said . McAllister was arrested in San Antonio . Authorities have given no information on a motive for the fires .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 7-year-old boy from El Paso , Texas , was gunned down across the border in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general 's office told CNN Tuesday . Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout , spokesman Arturo Sandoval said . At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez 's dad , Sandoval said . The father , Raul Ramirez Alvarado , 35 , died in the driver 's seat . The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle , but was apparently shot in the back , Sandoval said . The boy 's body fell forward in front of the vehicle . The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday . No arrests had been made as of Tuesday , the spokesman said . Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso , Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN . `` It 's a senseless tragedy that we 're trying to come to terms with , '' she said . According to El Paso County records , Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed . The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso , Ayala said . It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district . Raul 's classmates were spared the details of his death , but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy 's passing . Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers , Ayala said . More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez , out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people . A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world . According to statistics from local prosecutors , Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day . The bloodiest month this year has been September , with 476 killings reported . The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso , but as Friday 's shooting showed , the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other . Because of the ongoing investigation , Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father , but added that at least 90 percent of the city 's homicides are drug-related . Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year . In early 2009 , a 3-year-old girl was killed together with her father inside a vehicle that was targeted , Sandoval said .","question":""}

First Up : Senate Health Care Plan AZUZ : First up , the Senate has come up with its plan to reform the U.S. health care system . The proposed bill , released last night . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says it would give health insurance to 30 million more Americans and would cost an estimated $ 849 billion over the next 10 years . Some senators now opposed to the bill are concerned about what it covers and how much it costs . Republicans have threatened to try and block the legislation from being passed . Debate on it could start as soon as Saturday . Afghan Inauguration AZUZ : Hamid Karzai is scheduled to be sworn in today for his second term as the president of Afghanistan . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says this is a `` critical moment '' for that country , because it 's a chance for Karzai to show what kind of government he 'll lead .

The Afghan president , under pressure to clean up corruption in his government , and Secretary Clinton is expected to talk with him about some guidelines that Afghanistan will have to meet in order to continue getting aid from the U.S. Clinton says that America wants to be partners with Afghanistan and with the Afghan people , and that is why President Obama has been reviewing the U.S. approach to the country . Nuclear Fears AZUZ : No deal ! That 's what Iran seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries . This plan was worked out at a meeting last month . Iran would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel , and then that would go back to Iran to be used in medical facilities . But now , instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel , one Iranian official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel , and the trade would have to happen in Iran . All this is part of the ongoing tension over the Middle Eastern nation 's nuclear program . Iran says it 's only being used for peaceful reasons . But other countries believe Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons .

ERIC HOLDER , U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL : It was a decision that was case-driven . It 's a decision based on the evidence that I know , that frankly , some of the people who have criticized the decision do not have access to . HAYES : Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee led the intense criticism of Holder 's decision . SENATOR JON KYL , -LRB- R -RRB- ARIZONA : How could you be more likely to get a conviction in federal court when Khalid Sheik Mohammed has already asked to plead guilty before a military commission and be executed ? HAYES : But Democrats who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of New York to handle the trials , even though it was the epicenter of the 9\/11 attacks . SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN , -LRB- D -RRB- CALIFORNIA : I happen to believe that New York City is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner . HAYES : And Holder said it in no way undermines the administration 's commitment to fighting terror . HOLDER : We are at war , and we will use every instrument of national power -- civilian , military , law enforcement , intelligence , diplomatic and others -- to win . HAYES : Holder also told the panel that he is not concerned that a federal court could find the suspected terrorists not guilty . He said he has told prosecutors that these are cases that must be won .

Dwarfed by their keepers , each orphaned elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has a tragic tale . This is Sala . She 's 6 weeks old . They say her mother died because of starvation in the Kenyan drought . The person who found her gave her cow 's milk , which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat . Sala wandered into a tourist camp in Kenya 's Sala National Park , alone and confused . The orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her . Carefully strapped in and traumatized , they evacuated Sala to Nairobi . For weeks , she was too sick to stand . Three days ago , she started walking again . If she makes it , she wo n't be alone . Drought , poaching and shrinking habitats have decimated elephant herds across East Africa . And the orphanage is fuller than it 's been in 30 years . Still , Dame Daphne Sheldrick will take more . DAME DAPHNE SHELDRICK , DAVID SHELDRICK WILDLIFE TRUST : Whatever comes in , we have to make space . MCKENZIE : It takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild . For the keepers , it 's not just a 9 to 5 job . EDWIN LUSICHI , CHIEF KEEPER : But after working with these elephants , it 's no longer just a job . It is from inside your heart , the love that you have for these animals . MCKENZIE : Every three hours , day and night , the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants . It costs $ 900 a month to care for each orphan , so the elephants have to earn their keep . With a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin , the babies go on parade . They slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun , but not the heartbreak . MCKENZIE : So , they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage . It could take years before Sala joins a family of wild elephants . In the care of her human family , she might just make it .

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The 17-year sentence given to convicted terrorist plotter Jose Padilla was ruled too lenient by a federal appeals court on Monday , a legal victory for the Obama administration . A divided 2-1 panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said the federal judge presiding over the 2007 conspiracy trial did not properly take into account the former gang member 's past criminal history when sentencing him . Padilla and two others were found guilty of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens and provide material support to terrorists . `` Padilla 's sentence is substantively unreasonable because it ... does not adequately account for his risk of recidivism , was based partly on an impermissible comparison to sentences imposed in other terrorism cases , and was based in part on inappropriate factors , '' said the majority . `` First , the district court acknowledged that Padilla had a criminal history but then unreasonably discounted this criminal history when it imposed a sentence . The presentence investigation report classified Padilla as a career offender , pursuant to -LSB- federal law -RSB- because of his extensive criminal history , which included 17 arrests and a murder conviction . '' Padilla was originally arrested nearly a decade ago on accusations he planned to set off radioactive `` dirty bombs '' in the United States . He had been held for 3 \u00c2 1\/2 years as an `` enemy combatant '' in military confinement , without being charged in that alleged plot . His later convictions were not related to those accusations , and prosecutors did not present the `` dirty bomb '' plot to the jury . He and co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi were also found guilty of the three counts charged : conspiracy to murder , kidnap , and maim people in a foreign country ; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists ; and providing material support for terrorists . The appeals panel upheld the convictions and sentences of the other two defendants but said Padilla 's prison term was too light , ordering the trial judge to resentence him . The judges supporting the tougher sentence were Chief Judge Joel Dubina -- a George H.W. Bush appointee -- and William Pryor , a George W. Bush appointee . The order did not include a deadline for resentencing . A federal court jury in Miami in August 2007 had deliberated for just under two days before handing down the guilty verdicts . Padilla received a `` fair trial and a just verdict , '' the Bush White House said in a statement at the time , but the administration decided to appeal the sentence . The Obama administration picked up the case in 2009 . There was no immediate reaction to the appeals ruling from either Padilla 's legal team or the Justice Department . During the trial , prosecutors played more than 70 intercepted phone calls among the defendants for jurors , including seven that featured Padilla , now 40 . He is a Brooklyn-born convert to Islam who also is referred to in court papers as Abu Abdullah al Mujahir . FBI agent John Kavanaugh testified that the calls were made in code , which Padilla used to discuss traveling overseas to fight with Islamic militants , along with side trips to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan . Padilla 's lawyers had argued he never spoke in code . His voice is heard on only seven of 300,000 taped conversations . In dissent in Monday 's ruling , Judge Rosemary Barkett questioned Kavanaugh 's testimony , saying his `` opinion testimony should have been excluded because he was never qualified as an expert and did not have the requisite firsthand knowledge to offer his lay opinion . '' She also said the appeals court should not have questioned the trial judge 's discretion over the sentence . The Supreme Court in 2004 had heard Padilla 's original appeal over his former enemy - combatant status , claiming he deserved a chance to contest his prior military detention on constitutional grounds . He was arrested in May 2002 at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport as he returned from overseas , where he had been living . He was detained as a material witness in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks investigation . President George W. Bush designated him an `` enemy combatant '' the following month and turned him over to the military . He was one of the few terror suspects designated by the U.S. as an enemy combatant since 9\/11 . Padilla was held in a South Carolina naval brig for 3 1\/2 years before the government brought criminal charges against him . In November 2006 , he was added to an existing indictment in south Florida , which said Padilla and his co-defendants belonged to a North American terrorist support cell and intended to carry out jihad , or holy war , in foreign countries . He was originally accused of , but never charged with , being a potential `` dirty bomber , '' allegedly plotting to detonate a crude explosive device laden with radioactive materials in the United States . Those allegations were not included in the criminal indictment . Two other enemy combatants eventually were sent overseas to the custody of other nations . The Obama administration has since abandoned using the term `` enemy combatant . '' The current White House has been criticized for continuing many of the anti-terror policies of the Bush administration , including military prosecutions of high-value suspected terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay . But some conservatives have also slammed President Barack Obama for his previous desire to close the prison facility in Cuba and prosecute terrorists in civilian federal courts in the United States . That policy has since been abandoned . '' Those three cases that include Padilla , as well as other appeals from foreign nationals held as enemy combatants overseas at a U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , have tested the government 's power to interrogate captives without allowing them regular access to a lawyer or the judicial system , on the grounds that they may pose a future threat or know about pending terrorist attacks . The current ruling is U.S. v. Padilla -LRB- 08-10494 -RRB- .","question":""}

Nancy Reagan stood arm-in-arm with House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio to pull down the curtain from the statue . She thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California for making the event possible . In her remarks , Pelosi noted that the former president 's statue contains pieces of the Berlin Wall , '' as a symbol of his commitment to national security and to his success . '' The wall was torn down shortly after Reagan left office . `` I 'm so grateful to Californians for giving him this honor , '' Nancy Reagan said . `` Artist Chas Fagan has captured his likeness so well , and I think the addition of the pieces of the Berlin Wall in the pedestal reflects my husband 's commitment to freedom and democracy for everyone .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Real Madrid moved six points clear in Spain after winning a fiery derby match against nine-man Atletico on Saturday and then seeing defending champions Barcelona suffer a shock first La Liga defeat this season . Real marched to a 13th successive victory in all competitions , while Barca lost 1-0 at lowly Getafe -- who had won just once in seven games . Cristiano Ronaldo scored two penalties as Jose Mourinho 's side came from behind to win 4-1 at the Bernabeu , with Atletico having teenage goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois sent off in the 23rd minute for bringing down Karim Benzema when the French striker tried to go around him . The 19-year-old was replaced by substitute keeper Sergio Asenjo , whose first job was to pick the ball out of the net after being beaten by Ronaldo . Angel Di Maria made it 2-1 four minutes after the break when Ronaldo 's intended pass to Benzema fell in his path , and fellow Argentina international Gonzalo Higuain pounced on a mistake by Diego Godin in the 65th minute . Godin was also sent off for an 81st-minute foul on Higuain , who had been put through by Ronaldo 's clever pass -- and the Portugal forward sent Asenjo the wrong way from the spot to make it 4-1 . Atletico had not beaten Real for 12 years , but started the match promisingly as Adrian finished off a fine move to give the mid-table visitors the lead in the 15th minute . Barcelona , seeking to win the league for the fourth season in a row , succumbed to a 67th-minute header from Getafe defender Juan Valera after being caught napping at a corner . The Catalan side poured forward in search of a last-gasp equalizer , but Lionel Messi had an injury-time effort ruled out when substitute Seydou Keita was judged to be offside and then the Argentina star hit the post as he failed to match Ronaldo 's leading tally of 16 league goals . Pep Guardiola 's team will be hoping to reduce Real 's lead in the first Clasico clash in the league this season in Madrid on December 10 . Third-placed Valencia bounced back from last weekend 's home defeat by Real by winning 2-1 at mid-table Rayo Vallecano . Brazilian striker Jonas put Valencia ahead in the 21st minute and Argentine midfielder Tino Costa made it 2-0 on 56 , while Raul Talmudo scored a late consolation . The win left Valencia one point behind Barca after 13 rounds .","question":""}
{"answer":"LONGYEARBYEN , Norway -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday . The inside of one of the vaults at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean . Dubbed the `` Doomsday Vault , '' the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management . Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters -LRB- 427 feet -RRB- inside a frozen mountain . Wangari Maathai , a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries . The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . In all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes . The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds . Watch as `` Doomsday '' seed vault opens '' Eventually the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the Global Crop Diversity Trust said . The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen , in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole . Building began last year . The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding . `` The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , '' said Cary Fowler , executive director of the trust . `` At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . '' The vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside . `` We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , '' said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten , project manager for the Norwegian government . The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -LRB- 131-yard -RRB- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius -LRB- just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C -LRB- 25 F -RRB- . The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex , England , about an hour outside London . The British vault , called the Millennium Seed Bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops . Paul Smith , the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops . `` We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us , '' Smith told CNN . The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004 , the Norwegian government said . The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity . Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world . The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner -LRB- $ 9.4 million -RRB- to build the seed vault .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Barack Obama 's reference to `` lipstick on a pig '' has Republicans demanding an apology and Democrats accusing Sen. John McCain of a `` pathetic attempt '' to play the gender card . Barack Obama used the `` lipstick '' line at a campaign event in Lebanon , Virginia , on Tuesday . McCain 's campaign said Obama 's remarks were offensive and a slap at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton 's . Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in `` lies '' and `` swift boat politics . '' `` I do n't care what they say about me . But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics , '' he said in Norfolk , Virginia . `` Enough is enough . '' Watch Obama deliver his harsh words '' The phrase `` swift boat '' comes from the 2004 presidential election , when the group `` Swift Boat Veterans for Truth '' launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry . Read more about what Obama said Obama made his controversial `` lipstick '' remarks at a Virginia campaign stop late Tuesday afternoon . Watch what happens with politics and lipstick collide '' `` John McCain says he 's about change too , and so I guess his whole angle is , ` Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy , health care policy , tax policy , education policy , foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we 're really going to shake things up in Washington , ' '' he said . `` That 's not change . That 's just calling something the same thing something different . You know you can put lipstick on a pig , but it 's still a pig . You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change , it 's still going to stink after eight years . We 've had enough of the same old thing . '' Watch how tensions are rising on the trail '' The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line . The Illinois senator then praised both McCain 's `` compelling story '' and Palin 's `` interesting story , '' and said his `` hat goes off '' to anyone who 's looking after five kids -- `` I 've got two and they tire Michelle and me out . ... `` That 's why John McCain 's campaign manager -LSB- Rick Davis -RSB- said this campaign is n't going to be about issues , this campaign is going to be about personalities . '' Within minutes , the McCain campaign announced a conference call focused on the remark , which they said was a deliberate reference to Palin 's line : `` You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ? Lipstick . '' Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her convention speech , and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail . In Iowa last October , McCain drew comparisons between Hillary Clinton 's current health care plan and the one she championed in 1993 : `` I think they put some lipstick on the pig , but it 's still a pig . '' He used roughly the same line in May , after effectively claiming the Republican nomination . McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN the campaign saw a `` big difference '' between the two references : `` McCain was referring to a policy proposal . Obama was referring to -LSB- Alaska -RSB- Gov. Sarah Palin . It 's obviously disrespectful and offensive . ... `` Who has been talking about lipstick lately ? It was obvious . The crowd went crazy because of it . '' It was n't the first time Obama used the line . In a phone interview with The Washington Post last September , he used it in reference to the situation in Iraq . `` I think that both Gen. -LSB- David -RSB- Petraeus and Ambassador -LSB- Ryan -RSB- Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment , '' Obama told the Post . `` George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus , and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig . '' Other politicians have also used the phrase in recent years , including Vice President Dick Cheney , Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state , Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma , Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , Rep. John Mica of Florida and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado , among others . Torie Clarke , a former McCain adviser , even wrote a book called , `` Lipstick on a Pig : Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game . '' Still , the McCain campaign says Obama 's use was intentional , and they want an apology . `` Barack Obama 's comments today are offensive and disgraceful . He owes Gov. Palin an apology , '' said Maria Comella , a McCain-Palin spokeswoman . Obama 's campaign said `` enough is enough '' and accused McCain of running a `` dishonorable campaign . '' `` The McCain campaign 's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy -- the same analogy that Sen. McCain himself used about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's health care plan just last year , '' said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn . `` This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run . '' McCain ally Mike Huckabee took Obama 's side on the issue , saying he did n't think it was a swipe at Palin . `` It 's an old expression , and I 'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one . I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin ; he did n't reference her . If you take the two sound bites together , it may sound like it , '' he said on Fox 's `` Hannity and Colmes . '' `` But I 've been a guy at the podium many times , and you say something that 's maybe a part of an old joke and then somebody ties it in . So , I 'm going to have to cut him slack . '' But McCain 's campaign is not about to let the issue go . They released a Web ad Wednesday that plays Obama 's lipstick comments , then asks , `` Ready to lead ? No . Ready to smear ? Yes .

{"answer":"UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe 's longtime president , Robert Mugabe , and 11 senior members of his government . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets this week with Arthur Mutambara , an opposition leader . According to a draft of the resolution , the measure would have instituted a travel ban on Mugabe and others in his government , frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime . The measure received nine votes -- the minimum for it to pass . However , two of the five negative votes were from Russia and China , who as permanent members of the Security Council have veto power . One Security Council member abstained . The resolution was pushed by the United States after Mugabe ignored the Security Council 's appeal to postpone the June 27 presidential runoff election . The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai . But Tsvangirai withdrew days before , saying Mugabe 's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings , intimidation and murders against his supporters . With their votes , ambassadors for China and Russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the Security Council . Representatives from Mugabe 's party , the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front -LRB- ZANU-PF -RRB- , have been meeting in Pretoria , South Africa , with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change this week . Tsvangirai said Wednesday the talks , which are being mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki , are focusing on `` how to move forward . '' Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions . Wang said the adoption of the resolution would `` unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation . '' `` Many countries , including China , repeatedly called upon the Security Council to respect the position of the African countries on this question and give more time , '' Wang said . `` China has always maintained the best approach to solve a problem is negotiation and dialogue , '' Wang said . `` To use or threaten to use sanctions lightly is not conducive to solving the problem . '' Wang 's comments echoed those of Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , who said the Security Council would have overstepped its responsibilities had it approved the resolution . `` Recently , in the positions of a number of council member states , we have seen an ever-more-obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security , '' Churkin said . `` We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous , leading to a realignment of the entire U.N. system . '' Churkin also noted that , had the resolution been approved , council members would have ignored appeals from the African Union to let the South African talks take place . He also accused the council of missing an opportunity to coordinate a response that would have `` promoted the success of the political dialogue '' in Zimbabwe . Speaking before the vote , Zimbabwean Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said his nation has been a victim of `` incessant meddling '' from the international community . Chidyausiku blamed sanctions already imposed on Zimbabwe for its underperforming economy and the suffering of its people . South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo also urged the Security Council to give the South African talks a chance to bring about a resolution . U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the United States was disappointed at the veto . `` China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground , '' he said . `` The U-turn on the Russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing , '' he said , noting that a few days ago , the Russian Federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the Group of Eight meeting in Japan expressing `` grave concern '' about the situation in Zimbabwe . `` The Russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a G-8 partner , '' Khalilzad said . The draft resolution expressed `` deep concern at the gross irregularities '' during the presidential election , saying violence and intimidation before the runoff prevented `` free and fair elections , '' creating `` an environment that did not permit international election observers to operate freely before the June 27 vote . '' The United Kingdom , which has been highly critical of Mugabe , was a chief supporter of the United States push for sanctions . France also supported the resolution . `` The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa , '' British Ambassador John Sawers said after the vote . Watch the British Ambassador to the U.N. speaks about the failed resolution '' Sawers also questioned Mbeki 's efficacy as a mediator in Zimbabwe 's affairs . `` We have to be realistic . Those efforts have so far come to naught . The only one who has benefited to date is Mr. Mugabe , '' he said . After the vote , Chidyausiku thanked the council for heeding his call . `` Today we have seen reason , '' he said . `` I want to express our gratitude to the people in the Security Council who managed to see reason and refused to be intimidated or cowed into following the national interests of the U.S. and UK . '' The Zimbabwean people , he said , are `` committed to resolve their differences . '' CNN 's Richard Roth and Terence Burke contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Nestle plant linked to an outbreak of illness has been shut temporarily , and the company said Monday that it expects to lay off more than 200 workers as a result . Preliminary results `` indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , '' the CDC says . `` It 's likely that we 're going to have some temporary layoffs at that facility , '' Nestle spokeswoman Roz O'Hearn said of the Danville , Virginia , facility that was churning out refrigerated cookie-dough products until Thursday . About 550 people work at the factory , but only about half of them work on cookie dough , she said . The rest work on Buitoni pasta and sauce in a separate facility at the plant . She said there is little chance that the Buitoni products might be tainted , because -- even if the cookie dough is proved to be the source of the outbreak of E. coli 0157 : H7 -- it is a kosher product , meaning it is made from a segregated stream of ingredients . Danville 's Economic Development Office said the city 's unemployment rate is 14.3 percent . Nestle was first alerted to the problem late Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration , O'Hearn said , adding : `` Less than a day later , we made the decision to remove the product . We shut down . We stopped shipping . '' Included in the recall are 300,000 cases of the product . Each case contains 12 packages , and each package contains 24 cookies . That 's a total of 86.4 million cookies ' worth of dough . The recall does not include Dreyer 's or Edy 's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House `` cookie dough '' ingredients . That 's because the `` dough '' in ice cream is not really dough at all ; it is cooked . `` Ice cream is a different formulation , '' O'Hearn said . `` Since it 's not meant to be baked before consumption -- those cookie crumbles that are in the formulation -- they 're all cooked . For the cookie dough that 's present in the ice cream , Dreyer 's is using heat-treated ingredients . '' According to the CDC , between March 1 and Monday , 70 people in 30 states had been infected with a strain of E. coli . The ages of the people affected ranged from 2 to 57 years , though more than 70 percent were younger than 19 , and 75 percent were female , the agency said on its Web site . Twenty-five people had been hospitalized , and seven had developed a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome . No fatalities had been reported , it said . `` Preliminary results of this investigation indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , '' the agency said . `` Most patients reported eating refrigerated prepackaged Nestle Toll House cookie dough products raw . '' Though cooking the product would kill the bacteria , the agency did not recommend that people holding on to the company 's cookie-dough products do so , `` because consumers might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces . '' The recall does not include Nestle Toll House morsels , which are used as an ingredient in many homemade baked goods , or other baked cookie products .

{"answer":"DENVER , Colorado -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds , or even thousands , of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution , authorities say . A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients . Kristen Diane Parker , who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver , has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients , investigators said . She had hepatitis C , which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008 , authorities said . She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009 . Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker . According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration , Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C . She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients . Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be . She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl . Hospital officials then contacted the DEA . Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges . If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient , she could face up to 20 years in prison . If a patient dies because of her actions , she could face life in prison . In a statement to police , Parker said , `` I ca n't take back what I did , but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life , and so does everyone else . '' Her attorney could not be reached Friday . Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there . However , hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed . `` We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period , '' a statement on the hospital 's Web site said , adding , `` It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C. '' An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4 , 2009 , and July 1 , 2009 , when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs . Audubon is also contacting patients . According to the Centers for Disease Control , hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer .","question":""}
{"answer":"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates flew into Iraq on Monday to oversee a change of command of American forces . Robert Gates is greeted Monday at Baghdad International Airport by Army Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin . Gen. Ray Odierno will take over command Tuesday from Gen. David Petraeus , whose 20-month term in Iraq saw a significant decline in violence with the deployment of additional U.S. troops . U.S. forces are in `` mission transition , '' Gates said Monday , with some troops going home and others backing up Iraqis . `` There is no question we will still be engaged , but the areas in which we are seriously engaged will continue to narrow , '' Gates said during his flight to Iraq . `` The challenge for Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains we 've already achieved and expand on them even as the number of U.S. forces are shrinking . '' Odierno is expected to set the stage for an eventual U.S. withdrawal . Petraeus will become the new chief of U.S. Central Command , in charge of American forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan . Gates , who is making his eighth trip to Iraq , said Petraeus played a `` historic role '' during his tenure . `` I think he would be the first to acknowledge that he has had a brilliant strategy , '' he said . `` But it has been the brigade commanders and company commanders and the soldiers and Marines and others on the ground who have actually made it work . `` We have lost a lot of lives , but it 's really been an extraordinary effort of translations of a great strategy into a great success in a very difficult circumstance . '' At a dinner on the eve of the change-of-command ceremony , Gates presented Petraeus with the Defense Superior Service Medal . He also gave Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , the Distinguished Civilian Service Award -- the highest award given by the secretary of Defense to those not in uniform . `` I have never seen a working relationship like this , '' Gates told the two men . `` To find leaders to do what many considered impossible , you two are such men . '' Odierno will receive his fourth star on Tuesday in a separate ceremony ahead of the change-of-command ceremony . The defense secretary on Monday also met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and told the Iraqi leader that he has seen a notable improvement in security since his first visit to the country nearly two years ago , according to a statement released by the prime minister 's office . Gates said the cooperation between Iraqi security forces and coalition forces was responsible for the improvement in security , according to the statement , and al-Maliki praised the successes of the Iraqi armed forces . The prime minister said the gains have brought about a greater sense of normalcy in the country , allowing many internally displaced Iraqis to return to their homes . They also have spurred the economy , he said . The situation in Iraq is far different from that in past years , the prime minister noted . As Gates arrived in Iraq , three bombings -- two in Baghdad and one in Diyala province 's Balad Ruz -- provided a rude counterpoint to that message . Two car bombs went off in central Baghdad . The blasts killed 12 people and wounded 36 in the commercial area of the Karrada district , an Interior Ministry official said . The U.S. blamed al Qaeda in Iraq , but gave a lower death toll , saying two `` possible '' car bombs killed six people and wounded 27 . In Balad Ruz , a female suicide bomber detonated explosives at the house of a former U.S. detainee , killing at least 22 people and wounding 33 , according to a Diyala security official . The U.S. military also blamed al Qaeda in Iraq for a car bombing Friday in Dujail , north of Baghdad . The Interior Ministry said at least 30 people were killed and 45 wounded ; the U.S. said 31 were killed and 40 were wounded .

The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception . He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington 's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception , the largest Roman Catholic church in North America . Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a `` deep shame '' and called it `` gravely immoral behavior .

'' he asked . Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a `` moral renewal . '' Earlier Wednesday , President Bush , first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- People along the Texas coast were leaving home or planning to evacuate Thursday as Hurricane Ike churned toward them , slowly intensifying on its march west . Forecasters say the storm could slam into the Texas coast -- south of Galveston -- as a powerful Category 3 storm late Friday or early Saturday . Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were planned or underway in at least seven coastal counties . Aransas County , on the eastern coast of Texas , has ordered a mandatory evacuation of all nonessential government employees , becoming the latest county in the state to urge residents to flee . In Galveston , city officials ordered mandatory evacuations for part of the island town beginning at 7 a.m. Thursday . The rest of the town will be under a voluntary evacuation order . Only residents will be required to evacuate on the western end of the island . Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas defended that , saying current models call for Galveston to be hit with winds and rain only equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane . `` We do not intend to evacuate Galveston Island , '' she said . `` It 's the last thing we want to do . Our job is to protect lives and property , -LSB- and -RSB- right now we feel that sheltering in place is the best action for our citizens to take . '' Farther up the Gulf Coast and closer to where the National Hurricane Center predicts a direct hit , Brazoria County ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin at 8 a.m. Thursday . Some other Texas localities have ordered mandatory evacuations , while others have left the decision to depart up to residents .

The evacuation must be completed by at 6 p.m. -LRB- 7 p.m. ET -RRB- Thursday . Galveston is likely to experience a high tidal surge , officials said , urging people living in low-lying areas or mobile homes to get out soon . `` One of the things that the public has to understand if they decide to stay , there will be a period of time during this storm when they will absolutely be on their own , '' Brazoria County Sheriff Charles Wagner said . `` There will be no medical services ; there will be no fire department ; there will be no law enforcement , groceries , gasoline , drugs , electricity . '' The center issued a tropical storm warning from the Mississippi River 's mouth to Cameron , Louisiana , and a hurricane watch from Cameron to Port Mansfield , Texas , about 60 miles south of Brownsville . Tropical storm warnings mean winds of 39 to 73 mph -LRB- 63 to 118 kmh -RRB- are expected within a day , and a hurricane watch means winds of 74 and higher are expected within 36 hours . `` Hurricane Ike is now in the Gulf of Mexico and making its approach toward our coast , '' Gov.

Corpus Christi officials also began the evacuation process for residents with special needs , supplying buses to transport them out of town . Voluntary evacuations were issued in San Patricio and Victoria counties and parts of Jackson County , according to the governor 's office . More than 1,300 inmates from the Texas Correctional Institutions Division 's Stevenson Unit in Cuero were being evacuated to facilities in Beeville and Kenedy , Perry 's office said , and 597 were transferred from the substance abuse Glossbrenner Unit in San Diego , in south Texas , to Dilley . Naval air stations in Texas also began to prepare for Hurricane Ike 's expected arrival . Naval Air Station Kingsville was to begin moving about 50 aircraft to El Paso , San Antonio and Fort Worth on Wednesday afternoon , the public affairs office there said . Naval Air Station Corpus Christi will also move about 75 aircraft to other Texas locations , its public affairs office said .

In addition , the 138-page report -- covering 87 peer-reviewed studies -- said that such efforts may cause harm . `` Contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation , '' said Judith M. Glassgold , chairwoman of the task force that presented the report at the group 's annual meeting in Toronto , Canada . The Washington-based association represents more than 150,000 members . `` At most , certain studies suggested that some individuals learned how to ignore or not act on their homosexual attractions . Yet , these studies did not indicate for whom this was possible , how long it lasted or its long-term mental health effects . Also , this result was much less likely to be true for people who started out only attracted to people of the same sex . '' In response , the group 's governing Council of Representatives passed a resolution Wednesday urging mental health professionals not to recommend to their clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or any other methods . The group 's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation reached its conclusion after its review of 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 and finding `` serious methodological problems '' in the vast majority of them . Those few studies that did have `` high-quality '' evidence `` show that enduring change to an individual 's sexual orientation is uncommon , '' it said . In addition , the report cited evidence that efforts to switch a person 's sexual orientation through aversive treatments might cause harm , including loss of sexual feeling , suicidality , depression and anxiety . Many who tried to change and failed `` described their experiences as a significant cause of emotional and spiritual distress and negative self-image , '' it said . The six-member task force was appointed two years ago to address concerns about `` efforts to promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed through psychotherapy or approaches that mischaracterize homosexuality as a mental disorder . '' The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1975 . The task force noted that some people attempt to change their sexual orientation because it conflicts with their religious beliefs , and recommended that their mental health care providers help them `` explore possible life paths that address the reality of their sexual orientation , reduce the stigma associated with homosexuality , respect the client 's religious beliefs , and consider possibilities for a religiously and spiritually meaningful and rewarding life . '' `` In other words , '' said Glassgold , `` we recommend that psychologists be completely honest about the likelihood of sexual orientation change , and that they help clients explore their assumptions and goals with respect to both religion and sexuality . '' Alan Chambers , president of Exodus International , a network of more than 250 ministries that he said `` reach out to men and women and families that are affected by what we call ` unwanted same-sex attraction ' '' disagrees . He offered himself as proof that such efforts can work . `` The fact is that there are tens of thousands of men and women just like me who once identified as gay , '' Chambers said in a telephone interview . `` For me and for these people , the truth is change is possible . '' Chambers said his transformation from gay man began more than 18 years ago , when he attended a support group at the organization he now leads . Chambers , who said he married a woman nearly 12 years ago , has written a book , `` Leaving Homosexuality , '' which was published last month . `` You ca n't refute a personal story , '' he said , adding that about a third of those who try to switch their sexual orientation through the group 's ministries wind up doing so . `` We 're not talking a light switch that you turn on and off , we 're talking about very deep and complex issues that , I think , take years to resolve . '' Though all mainstream health and mental health organizations concluded years ago that homosexuality is not a mental disorder , the American Psychological Association formed the task force to work on the report two years ago after noting a resurgence of groups that identified homosexuality as a defect or spiritual or moral failing .","question":""}

{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Supreme Court has refused a lower court 's unusual request to decide whether a shocking 45-year-old civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later . The justices Monday dismissed an appeal involving James Ford Seale , convicted in the 1964 kidnapping of two teenagers whose bodies were found in a backwater area of the Mississippi River . The reputed former Ku Klux Klan member had long been suspected in the crime , but it was officially unsolved until Seale was indicted in 2007 , and later convicted . He is serving three life sentences . The move by the high court not to get involved keeps in place Seale 's original indictment , but does not resolve the larger question of whether similar cases can be prosecuted . The issue could have enormous implications for several dozen `` cold cases '' involving racially motivated crimes dating back to the 1950s . Seale had appealed his conviction , claiming the statute of limitations had expired five years after the crime . The confusion arises over the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964 , and thus had no time limit for a prosecution . The high court in 1968 eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime , and Congress four years later changed the law to reflect that ruling . But lawmakers 15 years ago reinstated kidnapping as death penalty-eligible . So the justices were being asked to decide when the statute of limitations kicked in , if ever . Justice John Paul Stevens , supported by his conservative colleague Justice Antonin Scalia , thought the court should get involved . `` I see no benefit and significant cost to postponing the question 's resolution , '' Stevens wrote in dissent . `` A prompt answer from this court will expedite the termination of this litigation and determine whether other similar cases may be prosecuted . '' Seale , a former sheriff 's deputy , was convicted in June 2007 of kidnapping and conspiracy in the disappearances of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee , both 19 . Federal officials had initially trumpeted reopening the Seale case . `` Today 's indictment is one example of the FBI 's strong and ongoing commitment to re-examining and investigating unsolved civil rights era murders and other crimes , '' FBI Director Robert S. Mueller said in January 2007 . `` Under our Cold Case Initiative , we will continue to identify and pursue these cases of racially motivated violence to ensure justice is served wherever possible . '' Seale was not tried for murder , but prosecutors alleged that he and fellow Klansmen conspired to abduct , beat and murder Dee and Moore in May 1964 . An indictment accused Seale and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the Homochitto National Forest in Franklin County , Mississippi , where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint . Dee and Moore were then bound with duct tape and weighted down by an engine block and railroad rail . They were still alive when they were thrown into the Old Mississippi River , where they drowned , according to the FBI . Their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers that would later be known as the Mississippi Burning case . Seale and another man , Charles Edwards , were arrested in the slayings in 1964 , but were released on bond and never tried . The FBI turned the case over to local authorities , and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify . The case was revived in 2007 when Moore 's brother -- during a visit to Franklin County to help research the case for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary -- discovered Seale was still alive . Thomas Moore told CNN in January 2007 that he gave the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi FBI files on the case , which he had obtained from a Mississippi reporter . U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton helped form a task force that led to Seale 's indictment . Seale was the only person convicted in the Moore and Dee murders , the Justice Department said . Since then , other notable cold cases from the civil rights era also have gone to trial . In 2005 , Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter for his role in the Mississippi Burning case . Adding to the unusual nature of the Seale case is that a lower court was unable to decide the matter . The full 18-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals split evenly on the time-limit question . They then asked the high court to `` certify '' the question , a rarely used procedure that essentially asks the justices about how to proceed . The Supreme Court was under no obligation to accept the case in this fashion , under its `` Rule 19 . '' That provision gives appeals courts the discretion to hand off to the high court `` any question of law in any civil or criminal case as to which instructions are desired , and upon such certification the Supreme Court may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for decision of the entire matter in controversy . '' The case is U.S. v. Seale -LRB- 09-166 -RRB- .","question":""}
{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former President Bill Clinton left the hospital Friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries , longtime friend Terry McAuliffe told CNN . Clinton , 63 , was hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital 's Columbia campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days , according to Dr. Allan Schwartz , the hospital 's chief of cardiology . Two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery Thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that Clinton underwent in 2004 -- was blocked , Schwartz said . An electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack , Schwartz said . `` If I know Bill Clinton , he 's going to get right back on the phone , '' McAuliffe , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , told CNN on Friday . `` Yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room , they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery . `` He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti . And I guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he 'll be back on the phone . '' Schwartz said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with Clinton 's post-bypass diet or exercise , which Schwartz called excellent . Rather , Schwartz said , this is `` part of the natural history '' of the bypass treatment . `` He really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise . He really followed the program , '' Schwartz said , adding he told Clinton that he 'd be allowed to return to work Monday . The stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service , Schwartz said . Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient 's heart vessels where they are inflated , pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow . The graft 's blockage is n't unheard of , because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years , Schwartz said . However , a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of Clinton 's heart -- still looks `` pristine , '' Schwartz said . `` We know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open , '' he said . Stents and chest pain explained Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after Thursday 's procedure . In a written statement , Douglas Band , counselor to the former president , said : `` President Clinton is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti 's relief and long-term recovery efforts . '' Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea Clinton , and wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , were with him at the hospital Thursday night , Schwartz said . Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East , but her departure has been delayed until Saturday , a senior U.S. official said . Bill Clinton has n't left the public eye since he departed the White House in 2001 , maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches . Since the January 12 earthquake that hit Haiti , he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the U.N. special envoy . On February 3 , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon placed Clinton in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there . Clinton also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January . David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst , said Clinton was `` exhausted '' and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month . Clinton had busy schedule before heart procedure Clinton 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday . Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery . Dr. Spencer King , president of St. Joseph 's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , rejected as outdated suggestions that Clinton needs to slow down . `` This is kind of a '50s concept , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday . `` Now , we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done . The outlook for people is totally different . '' `` If he slows down , he slows down , '' said King , who who has not treated Clinton . But , he added , `` It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up . '' King said Thursday 's stenting procedure may not be the end of Clinton 's heart woes . `` The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more , '' he said . `` There 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again . '' CNN 's John King , Ed Henry , Jessica Yellin , Elise Labott and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- International officials arrived in Iran on Sunday to inspect a newly disclosed nuclear facility near the city of Qom , state media reported . Inspectors from the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog -- the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- -- will visit the installation to make sure it is being used for peaceful purposes , said Ali Akbar Salehi , the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran , according to the Islamic Republic News Agency . The three-day visit comes after Iran said Friday that it needs more time to decide whether to sign onto a deal that could help end the international showdown over its nuclear activities . That proposal calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment . Tehran is studying the draft proposal and will have an answer next week , Iranian diplomat Ali Asghar Soltanieh said on state-run Press TV . Iran informed IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei that it is `` considering the proposal in depth and in a favorable light , but it needs until the middle of next week to provide a response , '' according to an IAEA statement . Delegations from Iran , France , Russia , the United States and the IAEA met in Vienna this week to work out details of the tentative deal reached in early October . And France , Russia and the United States indicated their approval of the arrangement . `` The Director General hopes that Iran 's response will equally be positive , since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of cooperation , '' the IAEA statement said . Tehran sent shock waves through the international community by revealing in a letter to the IAEA the existence of a second nuclear enrichment facility near Qom . `` It is important for us to send out inspectors to do comprehensive verification ... to assure ourselves that it is ... fit for peaceful purposes , '' ElBaradei said earlier this month . After the inspection , but before the end of the month , Iranian officials are expected to meet with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States -- plus Germany to further discuss Tehran 's nuclear program . Iran 's leaders maintain that their nation 's nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes , but many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities . Low-enriched nuclear fuel can be further enriched into weapons-grade material .","question":""}
{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Questions surrounding Judge Sonia Sotomayor 's past speeches generated more controversy in the final day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Thursday , as Democrats again called her a mainstream jurist and Republicans portrayed her as a liberal activist likely to legislate from the bench . Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor greets Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , Thursday . One GOP senator said Sotomayor 's most controversial speeches `` bug the hell out of me , '' an expression of frustration as Republicans tried -- with little success -- to get Sotomayor to reveal more about her personal views in her fourth and final day of questioning . GOP critics also summoned New Haven , Connecticut , firefighter Frank Ricci , who was the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case in Sotomayor 's appellate career . Ricci testified that her 2008 rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system . In a potential sign of Sotomayor 's strong political momentum , however , Senate Republicans indicated they do not intend to filibuster her nomination on the Senate floor . They also indicated their belief that the full Senate would vote on her nomination before breaking for its August recess . Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said he plans to put a confirmation vote for Sotomayor on the committee 's calendar for next Tuesday . The committee 's questions once again touched on a range of hot-button issues , including gun control , abortion , same-sex marriage , the death penalty , and the role of international law in American jurisprudence . `` I think you 're a walking , talking example of the best part of the United States of America , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , told Sotomayor . `` It is my belief that you are going to be a great Supreme Court justice . '' South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was less complimentary , telling Sotomayor that she has `` said some things that have bugged the hell out of me , '' but he quickly conceded that her judicial record has `` been generally in the mainstream . '' `` Your speeches are disturbing , particularly to conservatives , '' Graham said . `` Those speeches to me suggested gender and racial affiliations in a way that a lot of us wonder , will you take that line of thinking to the Supreme Court in these cases of first precedent . '' But , Graham conceded , `` to be honest with you , your record as a judge has not been radical by any means . ... You have , I think , consistently , as an advocate , took a point of view that was left of center . '' Graham defended the importance of probing Sotomayor 's political beliefs by highlighting the high court 's 1955 landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education , which mandated the desegregation of schools . The ruling was `` instructive in the sense that the court pushed the country to do something politicians were not brave enough to do , '' he said . Watch Graham talk about Sotomayor 's record '' The personal views of Supreme Court justices matter , he argued , because `` you 're not going to find a law book that tells you '' how to rule on contentious social issues such as same-sex marriage or whether there is a `` fundamental '' right to bear arms . Sotomayor later fired back at the Republican line of questioning , asking Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Oklahoma , if he wanted a judge who pre-decided cases before hearing the evidence and facts . Watch Sotomayor 's record on discrimination '' `` Would you want a judge or nominee who came in here and said , ' I agree with you , this is unconstitutional , ' before I had a case before me ? '' Sotomayor said , adding : `` I do n't think that 's a justice I can be . '' She noted that the Supreme Court spends considerable time on cases , including Second Amendment cases involving gun control -- an issue Republicans have repeatedly emphasized during her confirmation hearings . The National Rifle Association , unswayed by Sotomayor 's assertion earlier in the week that she recognizes an individual right to bear arms , announced Thursday that it is opposed to her nomination . `` We believe any individual who does not agree that the Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does not respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve on any court , much less the highest court in the land , '' said a joint statement by Wayne LaPierre , the NRA executive vice president , and Chris W. Cox , executive director of the NRA 's Institute for Legislative Reform . Sotomayor repeatedly said she recognizes an individual right to firearms in the wake of the Supreme Court 's decision in the 2007 case District of Columbia v. Heller . The high court in that instance ruled that a sweeping handgun ban in the nation 's capital violated the constitutional right to `` keep and bear arms . '' Sotomayor refused to say , however , whether she believed the right is `` fundamental , '' which in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states . On gun control , as in other issues , Sotomayor repeated that the Constitution and facts of the case would be the basis of her rulings . The highly charged issue of affirmative action surfaced most prominently later in the day , when Frank Ricci testified before the committee . Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions . The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals -- including Sotomayor -- backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano . The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court . The `` belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed , '' Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee . `` It only divides people who do n't wish to be divided along racial lines . The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics , discrimination , and nepotism . Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed . '' Ricci also criticized the 2nd Circuit for disposing `` of our case in an unsigned , unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph . '' Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke . She told committee members earlier in the week , however , that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of `` a very thorough , 78-page decision by the district court '' and followed a firmly established precedent . Watch Ricci testify at hearings '' The Supreme Court applied a new standard , she claimed , based on a different area of law . If she were ruling on that case today , she said , she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court . Ricci was one of a long list of witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor . Linda Chavez , head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity , which opposes affirmative action , argued that `` it is clear '' from Sotomayor 's record `` that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics . '' It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge , Chavez claimed , when she has `` shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her . '' Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor 's behalf , arguing that her opinion in the Ricci was case , in fact , an example of judicial restraint . It followed a string of legal precedents , he claimed , dating back almost three decades . FBI Director Louis Freeh and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor . Bloomberg told committee members that she is an `` independent jurist '' with `` sharp and agile mind '' who would bring `` a wealth of unique experience '' to the high court . Committee Republicans , unswayed by such assertions , once again examined Sotomayor 's controversial statement that a `` wise Latina '' could reach a better decision than a white man . Asked what she would say to people offended by her remarks , Sotomayor said that she regrets that she has `` offended some people . I believe that my life demonstrates that that was not my intent to leave the impression that some have taken from my words . '' Sotomayor was also asked to explain her remarks from a 2001 speech in which she said she agreed that `` there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives -- no neutrality , no escape from choice in judging . '' She told the committee that , in every case , the two opposing parties view the facts from vastly different perspectives . `` You ca n't just throw up your hands and say I 'm not going to rule , '' she said . There is a choice in judging , which means `` you have to rule . '' CNN 's Dana Bash and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the finest directors of his generation , winning an Oscar for `` The Pianist '' and nominations for `` Tess '' and `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but he is probably as equally well known for his own tumultuous life . Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate are pictured together in London in the 1960s . Polanski , who was arrested Saturday in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a decades-old sex charge , had lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States . The 76-year-old declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for `` The Pianist '' in 2003 . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a tribute to him , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . Polanski was put in `` provisional detention '' and now faces the possibility of being extradited to the U.S. , where a warrant for his arrest was issued in 1978 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl , but fled the U.S. before he could be sentenced . Polanski was accused of plying the girl , then known as Samantha Gailey , with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . Watch as filmmakers rally round Polanski '' She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski was born in Paris in 1933 of Polish-Jewish parents . Aged three , he and his family returned to Krakow in his father 's native Poland . After the Nazis invaded his parents were sent to concentration camps : his mother was gassed at Auschwitz although his father survived the war . The young Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto and `` soared out of Poland on sheer personality , '' according to director Marina Zenovich , whose 2007 documentary `` Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired , '' paints a sympathetic picture of the exiled movie legend . Growing up in war-torn Poland , the young Polanski found comfort in the cinema and in acting in radio dramas , on stage and in films . In 1962 , Polanski directed his first feature-length film , `` Knife in the Water . '' Poorly received in Poland it was a sensation in the West , and won an Academy Award nomination as Best Foreign Film . See images of Polanski 's life on cellulloid '' He later moved to England , co-starring with American actress Sharon Tate , whom he married in 1968 , in the Hammer horror parody , `` Dance of the Vampires\/The Fearless Vampire Killers , or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are in My Neck . '' Following his move to Hollywood , Polanski was at his peak : he was one of the hottest directors thanks to the critical and commercial hit Rosemary 's Baby and he was married to the beautiful Tate . `` At a certain point in his life , Roman Polanski had a lot of hope , '' Zenovich told TIME magazine in 2008 . `` He was living this great life . He was so talented and everyone wanted to work with him . '' But that hopeful period ended when Tate , eight months ' pregnant , was murdered by followers of Charles Manson in 1969 . According to TIME , Polanski spent the first years after her death on a kind of sexual spree , and began spending time with younger and younger women , like 15-year-old Nastassja Kinski . When Polanski was arrested for assaulting Gailey , his case drew the attention of Judge Laurence J. Rittenband , who had earlier presided over Elvis Presley 's divorce , Marlon Brando 's child-custody battle and a paternity suit against Cary Grant . Rittenband , in a manner reminiscent of the one-liner-dropping judge in the Anna Nicole Smith case , was obsessed with the media . He even had a bailiff maintain a scrapbook of his newspaper clippings , according court filings . The case proceeded in a strange manner . Rittenband , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . The judge 's bizarre behavior might have continued had Polanski not fled to France , where he has lived for the last 30 years , ultimately marrying again and having two children . Polanski has continued to make critically acclaimed films , such as `` Tess , '' an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel `` Tess of the d'Urbervilles '' which tells the story of a beautiful country girl -LRB- Nastassja Kinski -RRB- who is seduced by an older man . In 1981 , he returned to Poland to direct and star in a stage production of `` Amadeus . '' And 2002 's `` The Pianist , '' re-established Polanksi as a top-flight director . There have been repeated attempts to settle the sex case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director 's case was handled years ago . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be thrown out . Now married and known as Samantha Geimer , she filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife 's killers died . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . Atkins , 61 , died Thursday . She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer .","question":""}
{"answer":"MINNEAPOLIS , Minnesota -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal grand jury has indicted two Minnesota men in connection with the recruitment of Somali immigrants to fight with Islamic insurgents in their home country . Jamal Bana is one of several missing Somali-Americans believed to have fought with an Islamist insurgency . Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse are charged with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill , kidnap , maim or injure people overseas , the indictment states . The recruiting effort took place between September 2007 and December 2008 , according to the charges . Ahmed also is charged with two counts of making false statements to investigators . According to the indictment , he told FBI agents that he had traveled alone on a flight to Somalia when , in fact , he and another person were going together `` so that they could fight jihad in Somalia . '' Ahmed was arrested Saturday , FBI Special Agent E.K. Wilson told CNN . Isse had been in custody for some time , said Omar Jamal , the head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis . Both were from Minnesota and in their 20s , Jamal said . Jamal said Ahmed and Isse were `` foot soldiers '' carrying out the work of others , and that he expected more indictments `` in a week or two . '' The FBI has been investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by the al Qaeda-linked Somali insurgent group al-Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States . More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months , and at least three have been killed in Somalia , community leaders have said . The latest , Jamal Bana , was confirmed dead over the weekend , his family said Sunday . The same day , Somalia 's president -- a former member of the Islamist movement himself -- issued a plea to Somali-Americans not to join the fight in his country . `` I am saying to those young men from abroad : ` Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity . You should not return here to foment violence against your people , ' '' President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said . Al-Shabaab has ties to al Qaeda and has recruited foreign fighters to join its battle to overthrow the Somali government , U.S. officials said . It remains entrenched in the northeast and in sections south of Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu , after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May , according to the United Nations . Wilson said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is `` in the 10s , '' but their recruitment is `` a significant concern and one that we 're giving our highest priority . '' In October , Shirwa Ahmed , 27 , a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab , traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others . It was the first suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen , and it raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI . Burhan Hassan , a 17-year-old Somali-American high school student in Minneapolis , went missing eight months ago , around the same time as Bana . Last month , his family learned that he was killed in Somalia . Neither family has any idea why the young males left the United States , where they came as young boys , and Bana 's family believes he was being held against his will , said Omar Jamal , head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis . `` Only one time he placed a phone call -LSB- in mid-November -RSB- , he did n't say much , '' Jamal said . `` He spoke as if he was being held hostage . He could n't be speak freely . They asked him to cut the conversation short . '' Hassan 's uncle , Abdirizak Bihi , said a fourth man -- 30-year-old Zakariya Maruf -- was killed Friday , but Jamal said Maruf may only be injured . Maruf was the first of the missing Somalis to head overseas , said Bihi , who has become a spokesman for the families of the missing men . Bihi called him a `` leader '' whom the others consulted on travel plans . Many of the missing Somali-Americans are believed to have left for Somalia when Ethiopian forces were still on the ground . Ethiopia invaded Somalia to push the Islamists out of Mogadishu in December 2006 , but their presence in the country was an outrage to most Somalis and became a rallying cry for al-Shabaab . Ethiopian troops left Somalia this year , leaving Ahmed 's weak transitional government to battle the insurgents . CNN 's David McKenzie and Tricia Escobedo contributed to this report .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and other top Democrats are heading back to school Tuesday , in hopes of convincing first-time voters from the 2008 election to vote again in 2010 . The president is scheduled to headline a Democratic party rally at the University of Wisconsin in Madison while the vice president is the main attraction at a similar event at Pennsylvania State University in State College , Pennsylvania .

Many of those people were young voters , and exit polls indicated that two-thirds of people age 18-29 voted for Obama . In advance to Tuesday 's rallies , the president held a conference call with college and university journalists . `` You ca n't sit it out . You ca n't suddenly just check in once every 10 years or so , on an exciting presidential election , and then not pay attention during big mid-term elections where we 've got a real big choice between Democrats and Republicans , '' Obama said . There 's no mistake in the locations for the Obama and Biden rallies . In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , the Democrats face tough odds in holding onto open Senate seats and governorships .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities hunting the killer of a police officer in Northern Ireland last week say they have seized a gun and ammunition . Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs in Lurgan , Northern Ireland . They were found Saturday in Craigavon , the town where Stephen Carroll , 48 , was shot dead on Monday , a police statement said Sunday . Authorities also arrested two more people in connection with the killing of Carroll -- a 37-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman . That brings the total in custody to five , police told CNN . And they arrested another person over the killing of two soldiers just days before Carroll was killed . A total of four people are now in custody in the killing of soldiers Cengiz `` Pat '' Azimkar , 21 , and Mark Quinsey , 23 , at the Massereene barracks March 7 . The Massereene barracks killings were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years . Carroll was the first police officer killed in political violence since 1998 . The shootings have raised fears that the province could plunge back to the sectarian violence that claimed the lives of 3,600 people over three decades before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 . The Continuity IRA , a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement , said it had killed Carroll , while the Real IRA , another splinter group , said it had killed the soldiers , Britain 's Press Association reported . Northern Ireland 's top police officer , Hugh Orde , insisted Sunday that the militant groups that want the province to leave the United Kingdom and become part of Ireland are `` small ... disrupted , infiltrated and disorganized . '' `` The current wisdom is that they number around 300 in a population of 1.75 million , '' he wrote in Britain 's News of the World newspaper . But , he said : `` In the past 18 months or so there have been at least 25 attempts by dissident terrorists to kill officers on and off duty . '' Rioting flared near Belfast , the capital of Northern Ireland , after an earlier round of arrests Saturday . Police said petrol bombs were hurled at police in Lurgan , west of Belfast . There were no arrests or injuries reported , despite gangs of youths on the streets , authorities said . One of the men arrested in connection with the killing of the soldiers , Colin Duffy , 41 , is from Lurgan . He was among three whose arrests were announced Saturday . A fourth man was arrested Saturday night , said the police spokeswoman , who declined to be named in line with policy . She released no details about the man or the location of the arrest . The two British soldiers were shot dead a week ago at a base in Massereene , in Antrim , as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan . The soldiers had packed their bags and changed into their uniforms , authorities said . Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks , authorities said . Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded . Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings , with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers `` traitors to the island of Ireland . '' Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland . The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army . Danny Kennedy , deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party , which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom , also condemned the attack as `` wicked and murderous .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The city of New Haven , Connecticut , will promote 14 firefighters who were involved in a workplace discrimination case that worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court . The firefighters were among the New Haven 20 -- one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters -- who fought the city after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam that left too few minorities qualified for promotions . A U.S. District Court issued a judgment finding the city violated the civil rights of a group of the white firefighters when it threw out the exams in 2004 , according to Jessica Mayorga , city spokeswoman . The Tuesday decision follows a court action by seven black New Haven firefighters seeking to delay the promotions . `` Yesterday , the court entered an order that provides the City of New Haven with the legal sanction necessary to move forward and promote the fourteen plaintiffs in the Ricci case entitled to promotions , '' the city said in a statement . `` As a result , we intend to do so as soon as practicable . '' The firefighters will be promoted to either lieutenant or captain . Mayorga said the other six involved in the lawsuit were not eligible for promotions that were available at the time the exams were given . She said the court 's order only addresses 14 of the 20 plaintiffs . If the exams had been certified in 2004 , the other six plaintiffs would not have been promoted . The case was the center of attention during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor , who was on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that backed the city in the case . The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the appeals court ruling 5-4 earlier this year when the justices ruled that the city improperly threw out the results of the promotion exams . Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotion exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in Connecticut 's second-largest city . New Haven 's personnel department had contracted with a private firm to design the exams . When the results came back , however , city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam scored high enough to be promoted . The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII , employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a `` disparate impact '' on a protected class , such as a specified race or gender . The group of firefighters , claiming they were wronged by the city 's action , then sued , calling themselves the `` New Haven 20 . ''","question":""}

That 's the second best opening ever for a movie fronted by Dwayne Johnson alone , trailing only the first feature that starred the artist formerly known as The Rock , `` The Scorpion King , '' which banked $ 36.1 million in its 2002 debut . `` Race to Witch Mountain 's '' take was in line with expectations and garnered an okay CinemaScore grade of B + from an audience that was 60 percent female . It should stay strong at the box office at least until `` Monsters vs. Aliens '' opens in two weeks . Also in `` Race to Witch Mountain 's '' favor : weak competition from reigning champ `` Watchmen '' -LRB- No. 2 -RRB- , which dropped a hefty 67 percent from its big opening last weekend to gross $ 18.1 million . Zack Snyder 's adaptation of Alan Moore 's landmark superhero saga is clearly slowing down , although it has grossed $ 86 million in 10 days . Freshman fright flick `` The Last House on the Left '' was next at No. 3 , with an anticipated $ 14.7 million . That 's a decent sum for a horror movie that had the added benefit of opening on `` Friday the 13th ; '' indeed , it 's in line with what most scary remakes tend to bring in on their first weekends .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a nearly decade-long effort , the National Congress of Black Women on Tuesday honored Sojourner Truth by making her the first African-American woman to have a memorial bust in the U.S. Capitol . Speaker Nancy Pelosi and first lady Michelle Obama applaud the unveiling of the Sojourner Truth bust . Truth , whose given name was Isabella Baumfree , was a slave who became one of the most respected abolitionists and women 's rights activists . `` One could only imagine what Sojourner Truth , an outspoken , tell-it-like-it-is kind of woman ... what she would have to say about this incredible gathering , '' first lady Michelle Obama said at the Celebration of Truth ceremony . `` We are all here because , as my husband says time and time again , we stand on the shoulders of giants like Sojourner Truth . '' `` And just as Susan B. Anthony , Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott would be pleased to know that we have a woman serving as the speaker of the House of Representatives , I hope that Sojourner Truth would be proud to see me , a descendant of slaves , serving as the first lady of the United States of America , '' she said . Dignitaries and congressional leaders , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , House Republican Leader John Boehner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , attended the ceremony marking the unveiling of the statue . Along with musical performances , actress Cicely Tyson recited `` Ai n't I A Woman , '' Truth 's famous 1851 speech to a women 's rights convention . Clinton and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , who worked together to draft legislation to commission the bust , were among speakers who paid tribute to the late C. Delores Tucker , former chairwoman of the NCBW , who spearheaded the effort for the Truth memorial . `` What a wonderful day it is to be here in Emancipation Hall for this great occasion when Sojourner Truth takes her rightful place alongside the heroes who have helped to shape our nation 's history , '' Clinton said . `` Today , she takes her place in this Capitol , and we are the better for it , '' Clinton said . `` She is a sojourner of truth , by truth , and for truth . And her words , her example and her legacy will never perish from this earth , so long as men and women stand up and say loudly and clearly , ` We hear you echoing down through the years of history . We believe that your journey is not yet over , and we will make the rest of that journey with you .

They 'll hear the story of Sojourner Truth , who did n't allow those indignities to destroy her spirit , who fought for her own freedom and then used her powers ... to help others , '' Michelle Obama said . `` The power of this bust will not just be in the metal that delineates Sojourner Truth 's face ; it will also be in the message that defines her legacy . Forevermore , in the halls of one of our country 's greatest monuments of liberty and equality , justice and freedom , Sojourner Truth 's story will be told again and again and again and again . '' In 1997 , Congress passed a special act that called for relocating the Portrait Monument from the Capitol basement to the rotunda . The 7.5-ton statue depicts three leaders of the suffragette movement -- Anthony , Stanton and Mott . A group called the Sojourner Truth Crusade was upset about the statue 's relocation because it did n't incorporate Truth . After Congress agreed to go ahead with a move , advocates proposed commissioning a new statue that would include Truth . In 2006 , Congress passed a bill to honor the abolitionist with her own memorial .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Colleen LaRose , the Pennsylvania woman indicted for allegedly conspiring to support terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country , attempted to commit suicide in 2005 , according to a police report filed at the time . LaRose , who authorities say called herself `` Jihad Jane , '' was depressed about the death of her father , the report from Pennsburg , Pennsylvania , Police Officer Michael Devlin said . LaRose told Devlin she swallowed as many as 10 pills of cyclobenzaprine , a muscle relaxant . The pills were mixed with alcohol . `` Colleen was highly intoxicated and having difficulty maintaining her balance , '' Devlin wrote . I `` questioned LaRose about harming herself , at which point she stated she does not want to die . '' Devlin was dispatched to check on LaRose in response to a 911 call made by LaRose 's sister in Texas , who was worried LaRose might try to kill herself . LaRose was arrested on the terrorism charges in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on October 15 , a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office said Tuesday . She is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia , according to the U.S. attorney 's office . She will be arraigned at 10:30 a.m. March 18 in Philadelphia , the Justice Department said . Among other things , LaRose has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft . If convicted , she faces a possible life prison sentence and a $ 1 million fine .

'' Gorman said that when he lived with LaRose , she spent most of her time at home and frequently used a personal computer . `` I think she just used it to play games mostly , '' he said . `` I really did n't pay much attention . '' The alleged terrorist conspiracy began in June 2008 , when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she was `` desperate to do something somehow to help '' Muslims , according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday . From December 2008 to October 2009 , LaRose engaged in electronic communication with five alleged co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs , according to the indictment . LaRose and the alleged co-conspirators , according to a Justice Department statement , used the Internet to develop plans that `` included martyring themselves , soliciting funds for terrorists , soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions -LRB- through the collection of passports and through marriage -RRB- in order to wage violent jihad . '' According to the U.S. government official familiar with the case , LaRose raised money for the cause and recruited people to join it . The official also said she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia , Western Europe and Eastern Europe . The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations . ` Jihad Jane , ' American who lived on Main Street The indictment says that at one point , LaRose stole a U.S. passport to `` facilitate an act of international terrorism . '' Gorman told CNN that after LaRose left him suddenly last August , he realized his passport was missing . He said he reported the lost document to the State Department . Several months later , he said , the FBI came to see him , and he told them what he knew about her . In November , he said , he testified in Philadelphia before a grand jury . The FBI told him she was already in custody then , Gorman said . `` I really do n't know much , '' he said . LaRose had received `` a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden , and to do so in a way that would frighten ` the whole Kufar -LSB- nonbeliever -RSB- world , ' '' according to the indictment . LaRose agreed to carry out the murder , according to the Justice Department statement . `` I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying , '' LaRose said via electronic communication , according to the indictment . In 2007 , Vilks drew a cartoon of Mohammed with the body of a dog , prompting the al Qaeda terrorist network to offer $ 100,000 to anyone who killed him , plus an extra $ 50,000 if the killer slits his throat . Watch a profile of Vilks from 2007 Irish police did not confirm that Vilks was the target , but responded to a CNN question about Vilks by saying the arrests were `` part of an investigation into a conspiracy to commit a serious offense , namely , conspiracy to murder an individual in another jurisdiction . '' Irish police arrested four men and three women in Waterford and Cork , authorities said . They range in age from the mid-20s to late 40s . Ireland 's national broadcaster , RTE , said the suspects are originally from Morocco and Yemen but are all living legally as refugees in Ireland . Irish police worked with counterparts in the United States and `` a number of European countries , '' they said . LaRose , along with the co-conspirators , believed that `` her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans , calling it a possible `` way to achieve what is in my heart , '' according to the indictment . The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country . LaRose traveled to Europe in August 2009 and `` tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task , '' the Justice Department statement said . According to the indictment , LaRose told the co-conspirator who allegedly ordered the murder that she considers it an `` honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for '' the co-conspirator , and she pledged that `` only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target . '' The killing did not occur , and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent . Mark Wilson , a federal public defender representing LaRose , declined to comment on the case Tuesday . The Justice Department said LaRose was born in 1963 and lives outside of Philadelphia in Montgomery County . Police records show she was arrested twice in 1997 : once for driving while intoxicated and once for passing a bad check in the San Antonio , Texas , area . She moved from Texas to Pennsylvania in 2004 . CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Carol Cratty and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report .","question":""}

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prague has not been nicknamed `` Zlata Praha '' or `` Golden Prague '' for no good reason . The well-deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture , history , art and beauty like no other . While not forgetting its more somber communist past , Prague has been one of the first East European cities to get a luxurious makeover . Designer shopping malls , exclusive restaurants and trendy nightclubs abound . But it is the mystical atmosphere of a Prague of past eras that leaves many visitors craving to come back . Largely untouched by the ravages of WWII , Prague is arguably the only European city with so many century-old buildings left intact for people to enjoy . All more impressive than the others , these are the historical sites you should not miss in Prague . Wenceslas Square : In 1348 , King Charles IV of Bohemia -LRB- now the Czech Republic -RRB- founded the town of Prague . The King built several open areas for markets , including Wenceslas Square , previously known as the Horse Market . Named after Saint Wenceslas , the patron saint of the Czech state , the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of Prague 's history , including the Nazi occupation , the Soviet invasion , and the Velvet Revolution . In 1969 , Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . And in 1989 , during the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the Communist regime , hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest . Today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country . Lining Wenceslas Square are fashion stores , cafes , bars and kiosks . Above the square is Prague 's Museum of Natural History , which was shot at by Communist troops when they mistook it for the Parliament building . Prague Castle : Kings , Roman Emperors and Presidents have lived in this legendary castle that overlooks the city . The castle is the largest medieval castle complex in Europe and arguable Prague 's prime tourist attraction . First built in the 9th century , Prague Castle has survived wars , fires and opposing political powers . The castle complex consists of the Saint Virtus Cathedral , viewing towers , a monastery , museums and art galleries . The Czech crown jewels are also held here . After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 , the castle became the seat of the President of the new Czech Republic . Charles Bridge : This magnificent 14th century gothic bridge over Prague 's Vltava river is lined with a series of large stone statues that represent important religious figures and icons . Its construction started in 1357 under King Charles IV and finished in the beginning of the 15th century . Until the 19th century , the bridge was the only way to cross between the Old Town and adjacent areas , also known as the `` Lesser Town . '' During the day , thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers . Dancing House : A masterpiece of modern architecture , Dancing House was named after dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers . Dancing House is also sometimes nicknamed `` Drunk House '' for its wavy curves . The building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by Czech architect Vlado Milunc and world-renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry . The top floor houses one of the city 's most exclusive restaurants , Celeste . Old Town Square : Located in the heart of the Old Town , this square included Prague 's gothic Church of Our Lady before Tyn , the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century . The church 's towers are 80 meters high and topped by small golden spires . Another fixture of the Old Town Square is the baroque-style St. Nicholas Church . In the center of the square is a large statue of Jan Hus , a Catholic priest who was burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy in 1415 . But the most popular attraction for visitors of the square is the famous Astronomical Clock . Astronomical Clock : Built in 1410 , the Astronomical Clock still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events , such as the relative positions of the sun , moon and major planets . Each hour , the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out . Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac , added by painter Josef Manes in 1865 . Prague Cathedral : Saint Vitus 's Cathedral is another one of Prague 's Gothic masterpieces . The Cathedral , set in the walls of the Prague Castle , was commissioned by King Charles IV and work on it began in 1344 . It took nearly six centuries to complete . Today it is the seat of the Archbishop of Prague and contains the tombs of many of the Bohemian Kings . The interior features stained-glass windows from different eras . One of the cathedral 's chambers was used to crown several Kings and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament . Vyshehrad : The old fortress of Vyshehrad and its surrounding parks is the place where the city of Prague was originally founded and around which the city was built . It is a great place to get a sense of the history of the city . Its thick walls house the National Cemetery , where many of Prague 's most illustrious citizens are buried , including Czech composer Anton\u00edn Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek .","question":""}
{"answer":"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The parents of a California girl who was allegedly raped and killed by a registered sex offender are calling for tougher standards against repeat offenders . `` How many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever ? '' said Kelly King , mother of 17-year-old Chelsea King , in an interview Thursday with CNN 's `` Larry King Live . '' `` I just do n't -- I do n't get it . Change has to be made , '' she continued , `` and I know that there are people out there that are trying to , you know , get this change in place .

'' On Wednesday , John Albert Gardner III , 30 , a registered sex offender , was charged in the rape and murder of Chelsea , who lived in the San Diego area . Gardner , who is being represented by a public defender , was also charged Wednesday with assault with intent to commit rape in an attack on a jogger in December 2009 . He pleaded not guilty to all charges . Gardner , of Lake Elsinore , California , will not be allowed to post bail . If convicted , the charges against Gardner make him eligible for the death penalty , the San Diego County district attorney 's office said Wednesday . The prosecutor 's office said it has not determined whether it will seek capital punishment . For the Kings , there 's no question . `` I think the death penalty is a very appropriate punishment for this case , '' Kelly King . Brent King said he had `` 100 percent agreement '' with his wife . Searchers found a body on Tuesday they believe to be that of Chelsea King . Police arrested Gardner on Sunday . King had been missing since February 25 . Investigators said she was last seen at her school in Poway , about 15 miles north of San Diego . Her car , with her cell phone inside , was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park . Searchers found remains in a shallow grave at that park ; they were found along the shoreline of a tributary south of a lake , authorities said . The body was found in a heavily wooded area not visible from nearby homes . A shoe had been found earlier in the same area , the sheriff said .

Gardner 's next court appearance , a status hearing , is scheduled for Tuesday . His preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 18 .","question":""}
{"answer":"NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Orleans Parish district attorney said he plans to look into deaths at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina , but stopped short of calling it an investigation . Staff at Memorial were accused of hastening four patients ' deaths in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . `` My office has not reopened an investigation into the deaths at Memorial hospital '' after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005 , Leon Cannizzaro said in a statement released Friday . `` As district attorney , I have a legal obligation to evaluate statements regarding possible criminal activity in this jurisdiction , '' the statement said . `` I am making that kind of evaluation , but that does not constitute an investigation by this office . '' The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in a story Saturday that Cannizzaro will interview New Orleans coroner Frank Minyard and possibly other pathologists on the coroner 's staff regarding the deaths of Memorial Medical Center patients . But the newspaper quoted Cannizzaro as saying an investigation would involve convening a grand jury and bringing in witnesses to testify , and he does not at this time have plans to do that . After speaking with the coroner , the district attorney said he would decide whether a more in-depth investigation is necessary . Cannizzaro 's spokesman , Christopher Bowman , said Monday the DA 's office had no further comment beyond the Friday statement . According to the Times-Picayune , Cannizzaro 's conversation with Minyard was prompted by an article in The New York Times last month that quoted two doctors as saying that they gave Memorial patients morphine and other drugs in the days after the hurricane struck , knowing they would die . Cannizzaro told the newspaper he would be `` remiss in his responsibilities '' if he did not talk to Minyard about information in the article . `` That does n't mean I am opening an investigation , '' he said . Katrina roared ashore near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line on August 29 , 2005 , rupturing three of New Orleans ' protective levees and putting about three-quarters of the city under water . Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. launched an investigation after officials from Lifecare , an acute-care facility operating on the seventh floor of Memorial , reported allegations that several seriously ill , mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial as the floodwater rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated . In 2006 , Foti ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses , Lori Budo and Cheri Landry , on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients . Former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan , who under Louisiana law was responsible for prosecuting crimes , gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony . In July 2007 , the grand jury refused to indict Pou . Foti said his investigation revealed that the four patients -- ages 63 , 68 , 91 and 93 -- were given a `` lethal cocktail '' of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , both central nervous system depressants . Pou , Landry and Budo all denied the charges , and their attorneys said they acted heroically , staying to treat patients rather than evacuate . In an interview with Newsweek magazine in 2007 , Pou admitted giving the patients drugs . `` If in doing so it hastened their deaths , then that 's what happened , '' she said . `` But this was not , ` I 'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people . ' We 're here to help patients . '' The grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck . All five were brought in by Foti 's office to analyze the deaths , and concluded the patients were homicide victims . After the grand jury refused to indict Pou , Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it . If Cannizzaro does decide an in-depth investigation is warranted , it could affect the outcome of a lawsuit in which CNN and The Times-Picayune are seeking the release of Foti 's investigative file into the deaths . CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia , six weeks after the hurricane . The case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court , which in July sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case is reasonably anticipated , according to Lori Mince , the New Orleans attorney representing the media organizations . A reopened investigation could lead the court to rule that criminal charges may be forthcoming . Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Doe had sued to block the public release of the file , claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules , that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy .","question":""}
{"answer":"Tehran , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tehran 's Revolutionary Court sentenced 11 people to death after convicting them of participating in post-election riots , state media reported Thursday . Two of the sentences have been carried out ; the rest are under appeal , the Iranian Students News Agency said , quoting a court official . These are the first executions known to be related to the post-election violence that erupted across Iran in June and has continued since , Amnesty International said in a statement condemning the hangings . But a lawyer for one of the men executed on Thursday disputed a key part of the official report . `` Both of these men were arrested two months before the elections and they were in prison until their sentences were carried out . So how can someone who 's in prison take part in protests ? '' asked Nasrin Sotoudeh , a Tehran-based human rights lawyer who represented Arash Rahmanipour , one of two men hanged Thursday . Full coverage of the protests in Iran His father had been scheduled to visit Rahmanipour on the day of the execution , and learned only from a TV report that his son was dead , Sotoudeh said , describing the family as `` extremely upset and shocked . '' `` Arash called his home two nights ago -LRB- Tuesday night -RRB- -- two nights before the sentence was carried out , and at that point Arash had no idea that his sentence was about to be carried out , '' she said . She said the hanging violated Iranian law . `` The entire process , the investigation , the trial , the handing down of the sentence and the carrying out of the sentence , were done illegally and in secret , '' she told CNN by phone . `` Arash 's family and I did not have his case file . A sentence must first be announced to the defendant and his lawyer and only then can it be carried out , but this sentence was never announced to Arash or myself . '' She said he had been forced to confess . `` He told me his pregnant sister had been arrested , too , '' she said . `` In two sessions where he was interrogated , they placed his sister in front of him and told him if he wanted to see her free he had to admit to things he did n't do . '' Rahmanipour 's sister was later released from prison but lost the baby due to stress , Sotoudeh said . Rahmanipour , 20 , was charged with being a mohareb , or enemy of God , and being a member of Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran -LRB- API -RRB- , a banned anti-regime monarchist group , his lawyer said . Amnesty International condemned the execution of Rahmanipour and the other man executed Thursday , Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani . `` These men were first unfairly convicted and now they have been unjustly killed . It is not even clear they had links to this group , as their ` confessions ' appear to have been made under duress , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa deputy director . The court said the defendants were convicted of `` waging war against God , trying to overthrow the Islamic government '' and membership in armed and anti-revolutionary groups . Anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed June 12 presidential vote , which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi . Late December marked the deadliest clashes in Iran since initial protests broke out in the summer . At least seven people were killed and hundreds were arrested , witnesses said , as they took to the streets on Ashura , which occurred on December 27 . The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence .","question":""}
{"answer":"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North and South Korea will hold three days of talks on reunions for families torn apart by the Korean War and divisions between the two countries , South Korea 's Unification Ministry said Tuesday . North Korean Yun Young-Seob hugs his South Korean sister Yun Bok-Seob at a 2007 reunion in North Korea . The talks , which begin Wednesday , will be the first on the subject in almost two years . The International Red Cross said it was sending delegates to mediate the talks , which will be held at the Mount Keumgang resort in North Korea . North Korea was also to schedule an early-October reunion for families across the peninsula who where separated in the aftermath of the Korean War , KCNA reported earlier this month . Rapprochement talks between the two sides have hit a wall since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor , Roh Moo-Hyun . Tuesday 's announcement was the latest sign of potential thawing in the icy relationship between the two Koreas , which have technically remained in conflict since the Korean War ended in 1953 . The Korean conflict ended in a truce , but no formal peace treaty was ever signed . Lee met last week , prior to the funeral of former South Korean President Kim Dai-jung , with a visiting North Korean delegation , who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries . Although the president reiterated his firm stance on North Korea , South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday . The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year . Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan . The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters . South Korea condemned the action , calling the launches `` provocative '' and `` unwise . '' South Korea is expected to make a second attempt to launch its first satellite later Tuesday after aborting a launch last week when a piece of equipment malfunctioned minutes before launch . Earlier this month , South Korea responded positively , but cautiously , to a joint agreement announced Monday between North Korea and the South 's Hyundai Group to resume cross-border tourism , ease border controls and facilitate cross-border family reunions . Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said that the two sides needed to reach an agreement through direct talks . A Hyundai subsidiary handles all tourism and business projects between the Koreas . The announcement of the agreement followed a weekend meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Hyundai chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun . Under the agreement , South Korean tourists would again be able to travel north across the border to Mt. Keumgang , a popular resort in the communist nation , North Korea 's state-run KCNA reported . Tours to Keumgang were halted in July 2008 after North Korean soldiers killed a South Korean tourist who strayed into a restricted area .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Shark attacks on humans were at the lowest levels in half a decade last year , and a Florida researcher says hard economic times may be to blame . Fewer people in the water means less chance for sharks to attack , ichthyologist George Burgess says . Sharks attacked 59 people in 2008 , the lowest number of attacks since 57 in 2003 , according to George Burgess , director of the International Shark Attack File , part of the Florida Museum of Natural History on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville . There were 71 attacks in 2007 . `` One ca n't help but think that the downturn in the economy played a part in it , '' Burgess said . Fewer people , especially outside of the United States , have the resources to go to the beach , he said . `` To have a shark attack , you have to have humans and sharks in the water at the same time , '' Burgess said . `` If you have a reduction in the number of people in the water , you 're going to have a reduction in the opportunities for people and sharks to get together . '' `` We noticed similar declines during the recession that followed the events of 2001 , despite the fact that human populations continued to rise , '' the ichthyologist said . Sharks killed four people in 2008 , Burgess said : one in California , one in Australia and two in Mexico . Forty-one of the 59 attacks worldwide came in the United States , and 32 of those occurred in Florida . Surfers accounted for 57 percent of shark attacks , swimmers and waders were the targets in 36 percent of the attacks , and divers the rest , he said . Burgess said the U.S. tends to see more attacks because of a large number of surfers , who are a favorite target of sharks . And neither the economy nor the attacks tend to keep American surfers from practicing their sport . `` All they have to do is drive to the beach with the board and get into the water , and the rest is free , '' he said . And while an attack may make them a bit more wary , he said , `` I 've yet to find a surfer who says he or she wo n't go back into the water after a bite or a nip . '' When the economy improves , shark attack numbers are likely to go up again , according to Burgess , predicting the number of attacks in the next decade will surpass those of the past 10 years . `` We 're putting so many people in the water that humans are dictating the shark attack situation , '' he said .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The forthcoming trial in Germany of John Demjanjuk could be the last occasion on which a Nazi war crimes suspect faces prosecution . German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp . But the legacy of decades-old efforts to bring the perpetrators of World War II atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily , according to a leading war crimes prosecutor . Many leading Nazis such as Hermann Goering , Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer were prosecuted by the main allies -- the U.S. , the Soviet Union and the UK -- shortly after the end of the war at the Nuremberg Trials . South African judge Richard Goldstone , formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda , told CNN that Nuremberg had been the `` first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable '' and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law . Yet many lower-ranking servants of the Nazi regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes , assuming new identities , fleeing Europe or even finding employment with Soviet or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the Cold War , according to Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center . `` These murderers walked into small cities and killed men , women and children and walked away without a trace , '' Hier told CNN . `` The sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute Nazi war criminals after Nuremberg , and had -LRB- countries -RRB- put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice . '' But Goldstone said that the creation in 2002 of the International Criminal Court marked a `` very important step forward '' to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten . While previous tribunals investigating crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were ad hoc creations set up by the U.N. Security Council , the ICC is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . Goldstone said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than Nuremberg had been , recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants . `` Modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at Nuremberg , '' he said . The jurisdiction of the ICC is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the U.S. , Russia or China . But Goldstone said the court was `` moving quickly '' towards universal ratification and said U.S. President Barack Obama 's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the ICC than predecessor George W. Bush had been in office . `` I 'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to , '' he said . Demjanjuk , an 89-year-old native Ukrainian deported from the U.S. this week , is alleged to have been a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people . Hier said Demjanjuk 's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the U.S. since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial . An Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on U.S. soil , while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired U.S. citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their Nazi pasts . But he said Demjanjuk 's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large . `` You ca n't just have a trial with documents . You have to have living witnesses , '' Hier said . `` Most of those witnesses are very old , most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial . '' But Hier said it was very important that former Nazis were pursued to the grave , living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them . '' -LRB- Nazi hunter -RRB- Simon Wiesenthal talked about two kinds of justice . There is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial . But there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door , '' he said . `` Every Nazi war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door .

The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol , hitting Siddiqui at least once Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor 's compound after finding her with bomb-making instructions , excerpts from the `` Anarchist 's Arsenal , '' papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks , and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars , according to a September 2008 indictment . The indictment said Siddiqui had `` handwritten notes that referred to a ` mass casualty attack ' '' listing several locations in the United States , and `` construction of ` dirty bombs . ' '' The notes also `` discussed various ways to attack ` enemies , ' including by destroying reconnaissance drones , using underwater bombs , and using gliders , '' the indictment said . `` Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific ` cells , ' ` attacks ' by certain ` cells , ' and ` enemies , ' '' the indictment said . `` Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training . '' Siddiqui -- whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda -- was extradited to the United States in August 2008 . Since 2003 , the whereabouts of Siddiqui -- an American-educated neuroscientist -- had been the source of much speculation . According to Amnesty International , Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi , Pakistan , in March 2003 , shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location . Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi . But in May 2004 , then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sandra Herold , the owner of a chimpanzee that was involved in a vicious attack on her friend last year , has died , her attorney said Tuesday . She was 72 . Herold suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm Monday night , Roger Golger said . Herold `` had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years , beginning with the death of her only child , then her husband , then her beloved chimp Travis , as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash , '' Golger said . Nash lost her nose , upper and lower lips , eyelids and both her hands in the attack in February 2009 , as well as the `` bony structures in her mid-face , '' according to doctors . More than a year later , numerous surgeries and therapy sessions have helped Nash regain some mobility . Her family filed a lawsuit against Herold shortly after the attack , seeking $ 50 million in damages . Criminal charges were not filed , however , because authorities ruled Herold was not aware of the risk her pet posed . `` This past year was particularly difficult for Sandy , '' Golger said . `` She hated living alone in a house where she faced constant reminders of the vibrant and happy life she once led with her family and friends . The stress of defending a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and all that it entailed also weighed heavy on Sandy . In the end , her heart , which had been broken so many times before , could take no more . '' The attack occurred February 16 , 2009 , when Herold called Nash for help in getting Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape . When Nash arrived at the Stamford , Connecticut , home , the chimp , who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her . Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds . The mauling has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets . Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals that citizens are not allowed to own . Nash was discharged from the famed Cleveland Clinic , where doctors performed the nation 's first face transplant , earlier this month . She is continuing her recovery at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , where doctors have said she is a candidate for a face transplant .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The number of minors treated in hospital emergency rooms for drinking on New Year 's Day 2009 was nearly four times the average daily figure , according to a federal study . The study , published this week in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology , was based on data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network , which estimated that 1,980 emergency room visits on New Year 's Day 2009 involved underage drinking , versus 546 such visits on an average day . `` This stunning increase in underage drinking-related emergency room visits on New Year 's Day should be a wake-up call to parents , community leaders and all caring adults about the potential risks our young people face for alcohol-related accidents , injuries and death during this time of year , '' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration chief Pamela S. Hyde said in a statement about the agency 's study . `` Parents , clergy , coaches , teachers and other role models must do everything they can to positively influence young people -- including talking with them early and often about the many health dangers underage drinking poses to their physical and emotional health and well being . '' The findings translate into an increase in sobering statistics , said Kenneth R. Warren , acting director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism . `` For example , during Christmas and New Year 's , two to three times more people die in alcohol-related crashes than during comparable periods the rest of the year , '' he said . `` And 40 % of traffic fatalities during these holidays involve a driver who is alcohol-impaired , compared to 28 % for the rest of December . '' The New Year 's Day levels outstripped those of other holidays . For example , Memorial Day emergency room visits for drinking by minors were 676 ; the Fourth of July level was 942 . `` Whereas all underage alcohol consumption is of concern , consumption that leads to ER visits on New Year 's Day should be of particular concern to parents and young people because such consumption may increase other risky behaviors , '' it said . `` Greater access to alcohol , less parental oversight and mixed messages from parents may fuel surges in underage drinking , which can result in visits to hospital emergency departments because of overconsumption or alcohol-involved accidents or injuries . The New Year 's holiday may be particularly risky because underage individuals may drink more than during most other times of the year , including other holidays . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the U.S. Department of Energy 's Loan Program Office has resigned amid a fiscal firestorm over the bankruptcy of a company that received a $ 535 million federal loan , DOE Secretary Steven Chu said . The loan program 's executive director , Jonathan Silver , was planning to leave his post and return to the private sector this fall , Chu said in a written statement . Silver informed Chu of his intentions in July , `` shortly after the fiscal year 2011 budget was completed by Congress and it became clear that no significant new funds were included for the loan program , '' the energy secretary said . However , two House Republicans looking into the bankruptcy of the solar energy company Solyndra linked the resignation to the loan . Approved in May 2010 , the loan allowed the company to build a factory in Fremont , California , to produce state-of-the-art solar panels . The company filed for bankruptcy in August , laying off 1,100 workers . Silver testified last month before a House subcommittee about the DOE 's handling of the loan , which has been at the center of a fierce political debate over the amount of government subsidies issued to new businesses . On Thursday , Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Cliff Stearns of Florida said Silver 's decision `` does not solve the problem . '' `` American taxpayers are already on the hook for the half-billion-dollar Solyndra bust -- what other shoes does this administration expect to drop ? '' the representatives said in a joint statement that went on to criticize President Barack Obama 's handling of the issue . Upton is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Stearns heads up the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee , which conducted the September hearings in which Silver testified . Self-described as the `` The Financing Force Behind a Clean Energy Economy , '' the program `` is currently supporting 28 projects with a total loan amount of $ 16 billion , '' Chu said in the written statement .

{"answer":"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Hillary Clinton decided to join her one-time rival 's team because she wanted to be part of the `` greatest adventure of our century , '' she said Monday after President-elect Barack Obama named her as his nominee for secretary of state . Sen. Hillary Clinton addresses the media in Chicago on Monday while President-elect Barack Obama looks on . `` President Kennedy once said that engaging the world to meet the threats we face was the greatest adventure of our century , '' Clinton said during a news conference in Chicago , Illinois , when Obama unveiled his national security team . `` Well , Mr. President-elect , I am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century . '' Clinton said she would work to restore America 's position as `` a force for positive change '' in the world . `` America is a place founded on the idea that everyone should have the right to live up to his or her God-given potential . And it is that same ideal that must guide America 's purpose in the world today , '' she said . Watch Clinton accept Obama 's offer \u00c2 '' During the news conference , Obama called Clinton a woman of `` extraordinary intelligence and toughness '' who will `` command respect in every capital . '' `` Hillary 's appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew American diplomacy and restore our alliances , '' Obama said . Speculation that Obama would appoint his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination to the nation 's top diplomatic post surfaced after the two meet secretly in Chicago in mid-November . When Clinton 's name was first mentioned for secretary of state , the Obama team reviewed the relationships her husband , former President Bill Clinton , had forged as part of his charitable foundation work . The Obama team was concerned that the relationships could create conflicts of interest . To address those concerns , the former president agreed to disclose the names of the more than 200,000 donors to his presidential foundation , a move he had previously resisted , Obama aides told CNN on Sunday . He also agreed to separate his work with the Clinton Global Initiative from his foundation work and submit the text of future speeches and other activities to State Department officials for review , the Obama aides said . In a statement , President Clinton said he was `` deeply proud '' that Obama has chosen his wife to be secretary of state . `` She is the right person for the job of helping to restore America 's image abroad , end the war in Iraq , advance peace and increase our security , by building a future for our children with more partners and fewer adversaries , one of shared responsibilities and opportunities , '' he said . During the presidential campaign , Obama and Clinton traded tough statements on foreign policy , but , now , Obama and Clinton will be in the same administration , albeit one led by Obama . Watch more about the other members of the security team \u00c2 '' In a now famous ad that showed a telephone ringing at 3 a.m. , Clinton challenged Obama 's readiness to handle foreign policy crises . Later , Obama questioned Clinton 's argument that she had more foreign policy experience . But during the news conference , Obama dismissed any lingering resentment between himself and Clinton as a result of the tough campaign . Clinton and the other members of the national security team `` would not have agreed to join my administration -- and I would not have asked them to be part of this administration -- unless we shared a core vision of what 's needed to keep the American people safe and to assure prosperity here at home and peace abroad , '' he said . Obama said there was not a `` light bulb moment '' when he decided to ask Clinton to be his secretary of state but would not reveal details on the talks that led up to him asking his former rival to join his team . Watch Obama praise Clinton 's abilities \u00c2 '' `` I have always admired Sen. Clinton . We have worked together extensively in the Senate , '' Obama said . `` After the election was over and I began to think about my team , it occurred to me that she could potentially be an outstanding secretary of state , '' he said . `` I extended her the offer , and she accepted . I know that 's not as juicy a story as you were hoping for , but that 's all you are going to get . '' Clinton will also be working with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , whom Obama asked to stay on when he takes office . Watch Gates on why he is staying \u00c2 '' Gates was responsible for implementing an increase in troop strength in Iraq that both Obama and Clinton criticized while on the campaign trail . He will now , however , work to implement the drawdown of troops in Iraq that the president-elect promised during the campaign . After announcing Clinton and the rest of his national security team , Obama said he was sure that team members shared `` a core vision of what 's needed to keep the American people safe , '' but he also wanted `` strong personalities and strong opinions '' in his administration . `` I think that 's how the best decisions are made , '' Obama said . `` One of the dangers in the White House , based on my reading of history , is that you get wrapped up in groupthink , and everybody agrees with everything , and there is no discussion and there are no dissenting views .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Top Democratic lawmakers called Tuesday for high taxes on the controversial AIG bonuses , as new details emerged on who got those bonuses . Congress is looking at ways to deal with the outrage surrounding AIG 's controversial bonuses . `` My colleagues and I are sending a letter to -LSB- AIG CEO Edward -RSB- Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell the employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them , '' Sen. Charles Schumer said on the Senate floor . `` Because if they do n't , we plan to tax virtually all of -LSB- the money -RSB- ... so it is returned to its rightful owners , the taxpayers . '' Schumer 's comments came the same day New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $ 1 million each . Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company . The largest bonus paid was $ 6.4 million ; seven other people also received more than $ 4 million each . `` Until we obtain the names of these individuals , it is impossible to determine when and why they left the firm and how it is that they received these payments , '' Cuomo wrote to a congressional committee . AIG has been under fire for awarding seven-figure bonuses to employees while being kept afloat by more than $ 170 billion from the U.S. government 's financial bailout . The company insists the payouts are needed to keep talented executives on the payroll , but public anger over the moves has prompted Congress and the Obama administration to seek some ways to reclaim the money . Watch Sen. Schumer vow to recoup the bonuses '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor Tuesday that the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee will pursue a legislative fix in such a way that the `` recipients of those bonuses will not be able to keep all their money -- and that 's an understatement . '' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D-Montana , will propose a special tax within the next 24 hours , Reid said . `` I do n't think those bonuses should be paid , '' Baucus said Tuesday . The special-tax idea was first floated Monday by Sen. Chris Dodd , chairman of the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs . `` We have a right to tax , '' the Connecticut Democrat told CNN . `` You could write a tax provision that 's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses . '' Watch why Americans have a right to be angry '' At an unrelated hearing Tuesday at which IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman was testifying , Baucus asked the nation 's top tax official , `` What 's the highest excise tax we can impose that 's sustainable in court ? '' Shulman did not respond directly , but Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , chimed in to suggest the tax could be as high as `` 90 percent . '' President Obama on Monday expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG . `` This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , '' Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House , where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation 's small businesses . Obama said he will attempt to block bonuses for AIG , payments he described as an `` outrage . '' See a snapshot of facts , attitudes and analysis on the recession '' `` Under these circumstances , it 's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay . I mean , how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? '' Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG 's financial products division , the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that contributed to the shaking of the world 's economic foundations . Watch Obama say he 's outraged by bonuses '' The president said he has asked Geithner to `` pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . '' Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation can not happen again . The president spared Liddy from criticism , saying he got the job `` after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . '' But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics . `` It 's about our fundamental values , '' he said . iReport.com : Sound off on AIG Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or `` retention payments '' -- by at least 30 percent . That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan , however . In the House , Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses . They 're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses , a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday . The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses , which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September , according to the committee aide . Who 's insured by AIG ? '' Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses . Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets .

{"answer":"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Briton accused of hacking into U.S. government computers on Friday lost his court appeal to have his case heard in Britain , his legal team said . Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation . The decision means Gary McKinnon faces extradition to the United States , where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into computers at the Pentagon and NASA . His mother , Janis Sharp , promised to appeal . McKinnon , who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems , wanted to be tried in Britain rather than the United States . He planned to ask judges at the High Court in London to review a recent decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in Britain , a spokeswoman at the prosecutor 's office told CNN July . The prosecutor 's decision effectively cleared the way for McKinnon 's extradition . The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time , accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001 and costing the government about $ 1 million . McKinnon , currently free on bail in England , has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs . Prosecutors in the United States and Britain disagree . `` These were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach U.S. defense systems at a critical time which caused well-documented damage , '' Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said in February . `` They may have been conducted from Mr. McKinnon 's home computer -- and in that sense there is a UK link -- but the target and the damage were trans-Atlantic . '' U.S. federal prosecutors accuse McKinnon of breaking into military , NASA and civilian networks and accessing computers at the Pentagon ; Fort Benning , Georgia ; Fort Meade , Maryland ; the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Colts Neck , New Jersey ; and the Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas , among others . In one case , McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington . McKinnon is believed to have acted alone , with no known connection to any terrorist organization , said Paul McNulty , the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia . A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity . If convicted , he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $ 250,000 fine . McKinnon 's lawyer , Karen Todner , complained that the United States has never provided evidence to prosecutors or McKinnon 's legal team to support their extradition request -- and in fact , under Britain 's Extradition Act of 2003 , U.S. prosecutors are not required to . McKinnon has previously said it was easy for him to access the secret files . `` I did occasionally leave messages in system administrators ' machines saying , ` This is ridiculous , ' '' McKinnon has said . '' -LRB- I left -RRB- some political diatribes as well , but also a pointer to say , you know , this is ridiculous . '' McKinnon was on the brink of extradition in August 2008 , when the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , France , refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the United States , effectively clearing the way for his transfer . Shortly after that decision , however , McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome , and he claims that diagnosis changed the case for extradition . It was on that basis that McKinnon made his appeals in Britain . Asperger syndrome is a form of autism that affects a person 's social communication and interaction , according to Britain 's National Autistic Society . Those affected often are of above-average intelligence and have fewer problems speaking than do those with autism . They sometimes have difficulty knowing when to start or end a conversation and can be very literal in what they say , with difficulty understanding jokes , metaphors and sarcasm .","question":""}
{"answer":"BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lebanese voters were heading to the polls on Sunday with their main choices to lead the next government a Hezbollah-backed alliance or a U.S.-backed coalition . Hezbollah party workers in the southern town of Nabatiyah hope for an election victory . Analysts say the race will be tight , with the Hezbollah-dominated `` March 8 alliance '' possibly winning a majority of seats in parliament . The polls opened at 1200 GMT and will close 12 hours later . Turnout is expected to be high among the country 's 3 million registered voters . About 50,000 troops were on the streets , but the run-up to the balloting had been free of violence . The vote comes at a critical time for Lebanon as it sits amid a power struggle between a weakened pro-Western government and a stronger pro-Syrian Hezbollah political bloc that has gained political momentum in recent years . The United States considers Hezbollah -- which is supported by both Syria and Iran -- to be a terrorist organization . The group grew in popularity after its militant wing claimed victory over Israel after a 34-day military conflict in 2006 . Since then , it has been more widely perceived by its supporters to be the `` defenders '' of Lebanon . Though U.S. President Barack Obama did n't mention the Lebanese general election in his address on Thursday , he did call for religious tolerance in the Muslim world , noting sectarian clashes between Sunnis and Shiites and the struggles faced by religious minorities . `` The richness of religious diversity must be upheld -- whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt , '' he said , referring to Christian groups in those countries . `` And if we are being honest , fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well , as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence , particularly in Iraq . '' In Lebanon 's unique power-sharing government , the presidency is reserved for Maronite Christians , the speaker of parliament is always a Shia Muslim , and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim . The law was created to balance power among Lebanon 's three main religious groups . Analysts say the Hezbollah-dominated `` March 8 alliance '' may win a parliamentary majority with the support of Christian opposition leader Gen. Michel Aoun -- the only prominent Christian politician to back the bloc . `` They keep trying to scare the Christian voters with their stories about Hezbollah 's weapons , so to all of those who complain about Hezbollah , can they tell us how they will disarm the party , '' Aoun told supporters Friday . `` Hezbollah 's weapons will no longer be a problem when the causes behind its existence disappear , including the borders ' issues . '' A close look at Lebanon 's political landscape reveals that the country 's Christian voters are split on how they will cast their ballots . Some Christian voters want their representatives to step out of the shadows of Hezbollah and Saad Hariri , who leads the Sunni-dominated `` March 14 coalition . '' Christian voters are divided between supporting Aoun and other Christian leaders who want Hezbollah to disarm . `` In these elections , Christians look more divided than ever while others seem more unified than ever , '' said Shibley Telhami , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . For the Obama administration , the elections could be indicative of the president 's odds of pushing stability in the region . Former U.S. President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Jimmy Carter said the United States should work with whichever coalition wins . Carter was in Beirut as part of more than 200 international observers monitoring the election . He also oversaw balloting in Gaza during the elections in the Palestinian territory in January 2006 . The Palestinian militant group Hamas won that race `` fairly and squarely '' by a huge margin , Carter said . The United States and Israel later refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Hamas win . `` And it 's resulted in a split in the Palestinians and a very difficult situation there , '' Carter added . `` I think they -LRB- the United States -RRB- learned a hard lesson that they should accept the results of an election . '' Two senior Obama administration officials -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden -- have visited Lebanon in recent months , signaling concerns with a possible Hezbollah victory . During his trip to Beirut two weeks ago , Biden warned the country that while the United States supports Lebanon 's democratic process , it will reconsider its assistance to the country if its next government strays from certain `` fundamental principles . '' Biden 's visit followed Clinton 's April trip to Beirut in which she called for an `` open and free '' election without outside interference -- a veiled reference to Iran and Syria . Such rhetoric has been dismissed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as `` meddling . '' The Hezbollah leader has been increasingly vocal in the lead-up to the election , blasting the current government as powerless . However , part of the reason Lebanon 's government is crippled is that it made concessions to Hezbollah -- including giving them veto power -- in order to end a political stalemate that boiled over into violence of historic proportions last year . While some analysts are concerned Hezbollah could gain more control over Lebanon 's government after Sunday 's vote , a key Lebanese politician , Dori Chamoun , warned that assessment may be misleading . Chamoun , who opposes the March 8 alliance , said talk of Hezbollah 's possible victory may be based on `` rumors '' and propaganda being spread by the Shiite militia and their political allies . `` They -LRB- Hezbollah -RRB- think they can scare many but no one is scared , '' Chamoun told CNN . `` They can spread all kinds of rumors on their four TV stations saying that they will win this upcoming elections . '' Chamoun , whose father , Camille Chamoun , was Lebanon 's president in the 1950s , is running for a seat in parliament . Even if a Hezbollah-dominated government does move in , it could have trouble working with Christian and Sunni Muslim politicians who -- under Lebanese law -- must participate in the government . It would also be difficult to find a Sunni political figure willing to serve as prime minister in a Hezbollah-led government since the majority of Lebanon 's prominent Sunni politicians are aligned with Hariri 's March 14 coalition , which has declared it will not participate in any government if Hezbollah wins . Lebanon 's political landscape could be shifting after a similar shift in neighboring Israel . Voters in the Jewish state overwhelmingly supported conservative parties over more moderate groups , bringing into power Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this year . Netanyahu is viewed in the Arab world as more hawkish than his predecessor , Ehud Olmert , who ordered the war against Hezbollah in 2006 . A Hezbollah victory in Lebanon could further inflame tensions with Israel , particularly with an estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at Israel from southern Lebanon -- all under the control of Hezbollah .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A court in Saudi Arabia has granted an 8-year-old girl a divorce from her 47-year-old husband , after twice denying the divorce request previously , local media reported Thursday . The marriage sparked condemnations around the world from human rights groups and U.S. and other government officials when it first came to light in December . Local media , which is highly regulated by the Saudi government , reported that the court in the city of Onaiza approved the divorce decree Thursday , and the divorce is final . A source at the court told the Saudi daily newspaper Al-Watan that the divorce `` came after a series of pleas made by a number of officials in the region to the husband . '' CNN efforts to reach court officials , the husband and the girl 's father have been unsuccessful . According to the attorney for the young girl 's mother , the father of the girl had arranged the marriage between his daughter and a close friend of his to settle his debts with the man . When the mother went to court to try to get the marriage annulled , Saudi judge Habib al-Habib rejected the request on a legal technicality . The judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl 's father -- was not the child 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , according to the mother 's lawyer , Abdullah al-Jutaili . However , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , al-Jutaili said . The lawyer said in the original marriage agreement , the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18 . The judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty , al-Jutaili said . The young girl lives with her mother , the attorney said , and was never told that she was married . When the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected , the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh . The appeals court declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting al-Habib 's verdict , and sent the case back to him for reconsideration . Under the complicated Saudi legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing . Earlier this month , the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage . Soon after that decision , Saudi Arabia 's justice minister told Al-Watan that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages . The law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses , Justice Minister Mohammed Al-Issa was quoted as saying . Additionally , al-Issa said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions , the newspaper reported . No details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned . The minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished . Responding to the justice minister 's comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law , al-Jutaili told CNN at the time , `` this is what we requested from day one , and we know that Saudi officials are working so hard on resolving this issue . '' Al-Jutaili believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other Saudi minors facing a similar problem . In Washington Monday , Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns called the marriage a human rights abuse . `` Child marriage is , unfortunately , still common in much of Saudi Arabia and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels , '' he told a conference on U.S.-Saudi relations . `` We were encouraged by reports that the Justice Ministry had begun to review the legal age of marriage . '' After the divorce was denied for a second time , the head of the United Nations Children 's Fund issued a statement expressing concern about the case . UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman said , `` the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Consent can not be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision . '' The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative Saudi kingdom recently . While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. . `` It is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , '' Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in January , according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper . `` A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married . Those who think she 's too young are wrong , and they are being unfair to her . '' Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry . `` We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , '' he said , according to the newspaper . `` We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women . '' Sharia law is Islamic law , and Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism .","question":""}

But his star grew as he took on television roles as the mysterious host Mr. Roarke on the hit drama `` Fantasy Island '' and as Captain Kirk 's archnemesis Khan Noonien Singh in `` Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . '' Born in Mexico City , Mexico , on November 25 , 1920 , Montalban knew at an early age that he wanted to be an actor . He moved to Hollywood as a teenager , and his first big break came when he was cast in a small part in a 1941 play , Tallulah Bankhead 's `` Her Cardboard Lover . '' After starring in 13 Spanish-language films in Mexico , Montalban made his American feature film debut in 1947 in `` Fiesta . '' Montalban became a member of the MGM stable and was often cast in the role of the steamy Latin lover opposite such female stars as Lana Turner and Esther Williams . While working on `` Across the Wide Missouri '' with MGM 's biggest star , Clark Gable , Montalban suffered an injury to his spinal cord that , despite surgery , would plague him for decades to come , according to Turner Classic Movies . It was during this early stage in his career that Montalban dedicated himself to changing Hollywood 's stereotypes of Latinos . `` When I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer under contract in 1945 , that 's when the image was at its worst , '' Montalban said . `` They did n't realize that by trying to be colorful , they were very insulting . '' Montalban played a wide range of film roles over the years , often relishing the chance to play in comedies . As he approached midlife in the 1960s , Montalban made numerous guest appearances on television shows including `` The Untouchables '' and `` The Lieutenant , '' eventually landing a recurring role as Damon West on the popular medical drama `` Dr. Kildare . '' During this period , Montalban secured his place in science-fiction history playing the evil but charismatic Khan in the first season of `` Star Trek . '' Montalban 's dignified demeanor and rich accent added flair to the small screen on a number of television shows . It also established him as a popular pitchman for Maxwell House Coffee and Chrysler . It was the role of the wise and benevolent Mr. Roarke on the 1970 's hit TV series `` Fantasy Island '' that perhaps earned Montalban his greatest number of fans , something he called `` very rewarding . '' iReport.com : Share your memories of Montalban But he said he tired of hearing fans shouting `` Zee plane , zee plane '' when they saw him . The line was featured in the show 's opening credits by another character , Tattoo . `` They think they are the only ones that thought of saying that , '' he told CNN during the 1990s . `` People mean well , but the joke gets a little tired at times . '' Montalban never tired of fighting for the rights of Latinos in Hollywood . For almost 20 years , he served as president of Nosotros , an organization he founded for the advancement of Hispanics in the entertainment industry . `` The ideals of Nosotros continue . As our community of Latinos in show business increases , so will our participation in all of the many aspects of our industry , '' he said in 1987 .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Muslim woman and the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations sued a judge Wednesday for allegedly ordering the woman to remove her hijab , or religious head covering , in court . Raneen Albaghdady , of Wayne County , Michigan , contends that Judge William Callahan told her to remove her hijab on June 16 when she was petitioning for a name change , according to the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in a U.S. district court in Michigan . Wayne County is also listed as a defendant in the suit . Callahan and the 3rd Circuit Court of Michigan said in a written statement that they had not seen the complaint and could not comment on the lawsuit . However , they said that Albaghdady did not object to removing her head covering and that she had not informed the judge that she wore it for religious reasons . The lawsuit says Callahan `` insisted '' that Albaghdady , a naturalized citizen , remove her hijab and that she eventually complied . It says the judge denied Albaghdady 's petition for a name change , saying that she had filed her petition five days too early . No further details were offered . The lawsuit seeks an order declaring the practice of `` forcing Muslim women to remove their hijab as a precondition to appearing in court '' unconstitutional and illegal . It asks that the judge and Wayne County not be allowed to `` take similar unconstitutional actions . '' The Michigan Islamic relations council released a partial video of the incident Tuesday on YouTube . In the 30-second video , the judge can be heard saying , `` The head piece ? No hats allowed in the courtroom . '' The statement from Callahan and the 3rd Circuit said that the YouTube video was `` missing some critical footage . '' `` In response to Judge Callahan 's direction , ` No hats allowed in the courtroom , ' Ms. Albaghdady responded , `` Okay , it does n't matter , ' and immediately removed her head covering , without protest or explanation , '' the statement said . `` Judge Callahan and the court have the greatest respect for spiritual practices and all religious preferences . Had he been informed that the head covering had some religious significance , the judge would have permitted Ms. Albaghdady to continue wearing it in court , '' it said . The suit comes a day after the state 's Supreme Court issued an order allowing lower state courts to `` exercise reasonable control '' over the appearance of witnesses and parties to lawsuits , a rule change that had been proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court . The order allows courts `` reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses '' so as to `` ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person . '' The order , which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence , is effective September 1 . The justices had voted earlier this summer to change it . The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad , who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head , except for the eyes -- to court , the order said . The judge asked her to remove her niqab , saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth , according to court documents . Muhammad refused , saying she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge . The judge said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed . She chose the latter , according to court documents . She sued the judge in federal district court , which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case . Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , according to court documents . Michigan is home to about 600,000 Muslims , and close to 500,000 live in the southeastern part of the state , according to the Michigan office of the American-Islamic relations council . The Detroit area , in Wayne County , ranks fifth nationwide for the number of Muslims , it said . Last month , the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state 's courtrooms . Daniel Mach , the director of litigation for the American Civil Liberties Union 's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief , said Wednesday the issue has `` come up in a variety of states . '' `` We are concerned about the growing number of incidents restricting religious expression in the courtroom , '' he said . '' ... This is an issue that affects a variety of religious faiths and others . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indonesia is no stranger to bombings such as the one that rocked two luxury hotels in Jakarta on Friday . Indonesian counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta . As authorities sift through the rubble of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels , which were struck by bombs that killed at least eight people , some could not help but think about past bombings in the Southeast Asian country . In 2002 , a bombing at two night clubs on the island of Bali killed 202 people , mostly foreign tourists . More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta . Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces . The bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah -- a terror group with ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda terrorist network . The group is suspected in other bombings . Many of those convicted in the plot were sentenced to death or life in prison . In August 2003 , the same JW Marriott Hotel that was attacked Friday was bombed , killing 12 . The Australian Embassy in Jakarta was targeted in 2004 . A powerful car bomb shook Jakarta 's central business district , blowing a hole through the embassy 's security gate , killing at least eight people and wounding about 168 . A year later , three suicide bombers targeted two tourist spots on the resort island of Bali . The bombings -- two at the cafes near Jimbaran Beach and one at a restaurant in Kuta 's main square -- killed 19 people and wounded at least 132 , according to hospital officials . Despite the string of bombings , presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal said Indonesia has made strides in addressing terrorist groups . Watch an eyewitness report of the blasts '' `` We have made significant progress in curbing the activities of terrorists , '' the spokesman said . Watch a report on suspects behind the blasts '' `` In recent years , we have several preventative successes in arresting terrorist cells just before they were able to make their attacks . And we have not had an attack since the Bali bombing several years ago . But this is a blow . This is a blow to us . But we will find out the perpetrators . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Most of us know we should n't be talking on a handheld cell phone while driving . But recent studies suggest that hands-free devices are just as dangerous on the road . Studies suggest that talking on a hands-free cell phone while driving is just as dangerous as a handheld one . Engaging in a phone conversation on a mobile device while driving distracts the brain and delays reaction times , experts said . Drivers are more likely to swerve between lanes , slow down and miss important signs . `` When you 're on a call , even if both hands are on the wheel , your head is in the call , '' said Janet Froetscher , president of the National Safety Council , which in January urged legislators in all 50 states to pass laws prohibiting motorists from using cell phone devices . A recent University of Utah study found that drivers engaging in a cell phone conversation on a headset were more likely to make errors behind the wheel than a driver talking to a front-seat passenger . `` It does n't matter what kind of cell phone device they are using , because the impairments are so large , '' said University of Utah professor David Strayer , who used a high-tech driving simulator for his experiment . Strayer 's study , published in December , concluded that conversations with a front-seat passenger can actually mitigate accidents , because the passenger can help observe road conditions and warn the driver of possible hazards . In Strayer 's previous studies , he found driving while talking on a mobile device is `` just as bad as driving drunk . '' The risk of getting into a car accident while talking on a wireless device -- including headsets and vehicles with built-in communication systems -- is growing as the number of cell phone subscribers increases . There are 270 million cell phone subscribers in the United States , up from 76 million in 1999 , according to CTIA -- The Wireless Association , an organization representing the wireless communications industry . In a survey by Nationwide Insurance , 80 percent of people admitted to talking on their cell phones while driving . About 45 percent of drivers said they have been hit or nearly hit by someone using a cell phone , according to Nationwide 's survey , conducted in 2006 . Some experts said drivers talking on cell phones are four times more likely to get into a crash than those who do n't talk on their phones behind the wheel . One study from the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis estimated that 636,000 traffic accidents each year -- about 6 percent of all accidents -- are caused by drivers using their cell phones , resulting in an estimated 2,600 deaths . Elderly and younger drivers are most at risk of getting into an accident when they talk on a mobile device while driving , said Arthur Kramer , a psychology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . `` I do n't think legislation alone is the answer , '' Kramer said . `` Education needs to go along with the legislation to encourage people that these are risky habits for yourself and for others . '' There is no federal law against using handheld devices on the road , but six states and the District of Columbia have such laws , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures , a group that tracks legislative data trends . No states ban the use of hands-free or wireless communication devices , experts said . Some private industries , such as trucking and bus companies , prohibit their employees from using cell phones on the road . Other states restrict teenagers from talking on cell phones while driving . Anne Teigen , a policy specialist on transportation issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures , says states are moving to ban handheld cell phone use . Almost all states have debated the issue , but many governments are reluctant to pass restrictions because they say there is n't enough research . They point out that talking on a mobile device is n't the only distraction . Other distractions , such as reaching for the glove compartment , changing the radio station or putting on makeup , also can cause accidents . The popularity of smart phones equipped with Internet , text messaging and e-mail present drivers with even more distractions . Such new technology also makes it difficult for states to keep their laws updated . `` Then there is the final question of whether these laws are enforceable or not , '' Teigen said . Some members of the cell phone industry are advising drivers to stop using cell phones on the road , but few have taken a stance on hands-free devices , because research has been limited . Verizon Wireless was one of the first cellular phone companies to support hands-free driving laws in the early 2000s . The company is focusing on promoting laws against text-messaging while driving . So far , only a handful of states ban the practice . Aegis Mobility , a Vancouver , Canada , company , has created a device that would reduce cell phone usage in cars . The product , DriveAssist , set to launch this fall with a major network carrier in the United States , will enable cell phones to automatically detect when a mobile user is driving . Users can subscribe to DriveAssist 's service , which manages incoming and outgoing calls , text messages and e-mails electronically . Callers get a message that the recipient is driving but can leave an emergency message alerting the driver to pull over and return the call . `` People find it hard to stop talking on their cell phones because we 've been conditioned our entire life to answer the phone , '' said David Teater of Spring Lake , Michigan , one of the product 's backers . Five years ago , Teater 's seventh-grade son died in a daytime car accident after a woman talking on her cell phone ran a red light . `` Her life was ruined as well , '' Teater said . `` She had no idea what she was doing was so dangerous . The vast majority of drivers have no idea that it 's dangerous . ''","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sri Lankans went to the polls on Tuesday in the island nation 's first peacetime presidential election in 26 years , despite explosions and mortar fire in the capital of Northern Province hours before polls opened . Once a stronghold for the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , the Northern Province city of Jaffna was a frequent battleground for the rebels and Sri Lankan government troops until a government offensive last year crushed the Tigers . While it was n't clear what the explosions were , they were nothing new for Jaffnans , who have lived under military control for decades . More than 14 million Sri Lankans are expected to elect their sixth executive president to a six-year term . Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa is seeking a fresh mandate for his government , but he faces a tough challenge from his one-time confidante and former Army commander , retired General Sarath Fonseka . Rajapaksa cast his vote in his ancestral town of Medamulana , near the southern town of Tangalle . `` I am very confident of victory , '' he told journalists . Fonseka was expected to visit a polling booth in Colombo . Queues were large outside most polling booths in Colombo and principal towns , election officials said . `` I waited in a queue for 45 minutes before I could cast my ballot , '' said Damayantha Perera of the Colombo suburb of Maharagama . `` I also had to wait for almost an hour , '' said W. Ramiah , a resident of Nugegoda , also of Colombo . Fonseka , who won wide acclaim for leading troops to military victory against the rebels , broke ranks with the Rajapaksa administration after he was elevated to the largely ceremonial post of chief of defense staff in July after retiring as Army commander . After Fonseka announced his presidential bid , the main opposition parties -- with widely diverse political ideologies -- closed ranks behind him to make him their common candidate . `` There has been abuse of power , corruption and nepotism . We want to abolish the executive presidency and make the parliament more answerable to the people . The best person to do this is the one who defeated terrorism , '' Ranil Wickremesinghe , leader of the United National Party , told CNN . Many of Rajapaksa 's family members , including his brothers , hold key positions in the government : Chamal is a Cabinet minister , Gotabhaya is Defense Secretary , and Basil is a member of parliament and senior presidential adviser . Other members of the family hold important positions locally and in Sri Lanka 's diplomatic missions abroad . The coalition of parties backing Fonseka includes a main opposition right wing party and a leftist Marxist outfit , as well as the Tamil National Alliance . Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the Center for Policy Alternatives , a branch of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence , said the situation in Sri Lanka , however , is `` a picture of dysfunction and breakdown . '' There have been allegations of interference with mail-in ballots , according to the group . Most of the complaints have been against members of Rajapaksa 's government , it said . There have been more than 700 reports of violence ahead of the election , with at least four deaths reported , Saravanamuttu said . Sri Lankans are casting their ballots in more than 11,000 voting booths across the nation . Local leaders have urged a peaceful voting day amid the escalating violence , including the shooting deaths of two people -- one a supporter of the opposition and the other of the government . A contingent of 85,000 police officers have been deployed to maintain law and order , said Mahinda Balasooriya , the inspector general of police . Each polling station has two to three police officers on duty , he said . The spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week that the U.N. chief was `` concerned about the growing violence in the lead-up to the presidential election . '' `` The peaceful conduct of the first post-conflict national election is of the highest importance for long-term peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka , '' he added .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Both people who died of swine flu in the United States had pre-existing health problems , federal health authorities said Thursday in a report . A student uses disinfectant as she arrives Thursday at the National Technical Institute in Mexico City . The 22-month-old child who died April 27 of the flu , also called H1N1 , had neonatal myasthenia gravis , an autoimmune disease , said the report , which was written by a virus investigation team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine . The child -- who was from Mexico and who fell ill while visiting relatives in Texas -- also had a heart defect , problems swallowing and chronic hypoxia , the report said . The 33-year-old Texas woman who died last week was pregnant when she became ill , the article said . She had been diagnosed with asthma , rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis . The details came in a summary of the 642 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection that were diagnosed between April 15 and May 5 in 41 states among patients ranging in age from 3 months to 81 years . Sixty percent were 18 years or younger and 18 percent had recently traveled to Mexico , the report said . It said that 36 of the 399 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection whose hospitalization status was known had been hospitalized . Of the 22 hospitalized patients for whom data were available , four were younger than 5 . Nine had chronic medical conditions , some of which included Down Syndrome and congenital heart disease . Seven patients said they had traveled to Mexico during the week before onset of illness . Eleven of those 22 hospitalized patients had pneumonia and eight patients were treated in an intensive care unit . Four were placed on ventilators . As of Tuesday , 18 of the 22 patients who had been hospitalized had recovered , it said . In a conference call with reporters , CDC 's Dr. Carolyn Bridges said epidemiologists would be scrutinizing the disease 's spread in South America , where the cool season is set to begin . Flu virus `` prefers lower humidity and lower temperatures for transmission , '' she said . `` We 'll be looking closely to the Southern Hemisphere during their winter to see what happens . That may give us some clues as to what to expect . '' Brazil 's health minister told reporters Thursday that four cases of H1N1 infection have been confirmed in Brazil . Three have been hospitalized and one is at home , said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao . One case is in Rio de Janeiro , two are in Sao Paolo and the fourth was in Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil . Two of the patients had recently been in Mexico City ; the other two had recently been in Florida , he said . Another 21 cases are suspected in Brazil , he said . In Buenos Aires , Health Minister Graciela Ocana confirmed Argentina 's first H1N1 case -- a man who arrived April 25 from Mexico . The man was hospitalized in the capital and released after he recovered , Ocana said . The ultimate course of the disease remains unclear , said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , who is involved in the effort to create a vaccine . `` We may be seeing the tip of the iceberg , '' he told CNN . `` We ca n't make any definitive projections about where this is going . It appears to be acting like a typical seasonal flu , only it 's out of season . We should n't be seeing this much influenza and it 's with a new virus and that 's the cause fo the concern .

{"answer":"Seattle , Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly 10 years ago , Maurice Clemmons pledged to make a fresh start . `` I come from a very good Christian family and I was raised much better than my actions speak , '' Clemmons said in a clemency application brief to then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2000 . `` I 'm still ashamed to this day for the shame my stupid involvement in these crimes brought upon my family 's name . '' Clemmons was 27 . He 'd spent the past 11 years in an Arkansas prison , convicted of offenses including robbery , burglary , theft and taking a gun to school . He was facing a 95-year sentence . A decade later , Clemmons is the subject of an intense manhunt in Washington state , suspected in the deaths of four Lakewood , Washington , police officers who were shot to death Sunday as they met in a coffee shop before starting their shifts . Authorities have said Clemmons is believed to have entered the Forza Coffee Company and opened fire on the officers with no warning . Police tracked Clemmons to an east Seattle home Sunday night , but after a standoff that stretched to nearly 12 hours , they entered the home and found that he was not there . In 2000 , Clemmons told Huckabee that the crimes occurred when he was 16 , had just moved to Arkansas from Seattle and had fallen in with the wrong crowd . `` Where once stood a young 16-year-old misguided fool ... now stands a 27-year-old man , who has learned through the ` school of hard knocks ' to appreciate and respect the rights of others , '' his petition to Huckabee said . Huckabee commuted Clemmons ' sentence in 2000 , citing his young age at the time of sentencing , making him eligible for parole . It was granted in July 2000 , after he told Arkansas parole officials that he `` just wants the opportunity '' and `` is not the same person he was when he came in , '' the documents said . `` It was not something I was pleased with at the time , '' said Larry Jegley , who prosecuted Clemmons for aggravated robbery and other charges in Pulaski County , Arkansas , regarding the commutation . `` I would be most distressed if this is the same guy . '' In 1989 , as he was being prosecuted , Clemmons demonstrated violent behavior ; he hid a piece of metal in his sock at a pretrial hearing , and before the start of another hearing he grabbed a padlock off his holding cell and threw it at a court bailiff . He missed and instead struck his mother , who had come to bring him clothes . In his 2000 brief to Huckabee , Clemmons said his mother had died while he had been in prison , providing him with further motivation to turn his life around . `` I have never done anything good for God , but I 've prayed for him to grant me in his compassion the grace to make a start , '' he said . `` Now , I 'm humbly appealing to you for a brand new start . '' But after receiving a second chance , Clemmons was apparently unable to stay on the right side of the law , according to documents and authorities in Arkansas and Washington . Arkansas parole board documents show that he was back in prison by September 2001 . The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that he was arrested for aggravated robbery and theft and taken back to prison on a parole violation . The paper said he was not served with the new arrest warrants for the robbery and theft charges until he was paroled three years later in 2004 . His attorney argued that the charges should be dismissed because too much time had passed , and prosecutors complied . Huckabee went on to become a 2008 Republican presidential candidate and has not ruled out a second try for the White House in 2012 . In a statement Sunday night , his office said Clemmons ' commutation was based on the recommendation of the parole board that determined that he met the conditions for early release . Read the clemency documents for Clemmons `` He was arrested later for parole violation and taken back to prison to serve his full term , but prosecutors dropped the charges that would have held him , '' the statement said . `` Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy , it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state . '' During his candidacy , Huckabee faced criticism in the case of convicted rapist Wayne DuMond , who was paroled in 1999 . He had been sentenced to life for raping a 17-year-old girl . In his first term as governor , Huckabee expressed support for DuMond 's release in a letter to him . Less than a year after his release , DuMond was accused of raping and murdering Carol Shields of Kansas City , Missouri . DuMond was convicted in 2003 and died in prison in 2005 . Shields ' mother , Lois Davidson , said in 2007 that she planned to campaign against Huckabee . Clemmons is believed to have moved to Washington in 2004 . The Pierce County Sheriff 's Department said in a statement that he was recently charged in the assault of a police officer and rape of a child . County court records posted online show that he spent several months in jail and was released on $ 150,000 bail Tuesday , days before the shootings . For a while after moving to Washington , Clemmons ran a pressure-washing and landscaping business . The license for the business expired last month , according to the secretary of state , with whom businesses have to register . In recent months , Clemmons has displayed increasingly erratic behavior , the Seattle Times reported . In May , he punched a sheriff 's deputy in the face , the paper said . In another incident , he had relatives undress , telling them that families need to be `` naked for at least five minutes on Sunday , '' the newspaper said , citing a sheriff 's department incident report . Clemmons also believed that he was Jesus and could fly , a deputy wrote , based on conversations with family members . The night before the shootings , Clemmons had threatened to kill police officers , but authorities did not learn of the threats until after the shooting , Pierce County sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer told `` Good Morning America . '' `` There 's not going to be a big motive other than he was upset about being incarcerated and was going to go gunning after cops in general , '' Troyer said .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The commissioner of the Cambridge , Massachusetts , police department said Thursday he `` deeply regrets '' the arrest of prominent black Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , but stands by the procedures followed by his department . Sgt. Jim Crowley said he has nothing to apologize for in regards to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. . `` I believe that Sgt. -LSB- James -RSB- Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with his training at the department , and consistent with national standards of law enforcement protocol , '' Commissioner Robert Haas said , referring to the officer who made the July 16 arrest at the professor 's home . `` I do not believe his actions in any way were racially motivated , '' Haas said at a news conference . Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer , who was investigating a report of a possible break-in at the house . The police department will create a panel of `` independent , notable professionals '' to provide an analysis of the incident , he said . The controversial arrest of Gates was criticized Wednesday by President Obama , who said the Cambridge police department `` acted stupidly . '' `` My response is that this department is deeply pained and takes its professional pride very seriously , '' Haas said . Cambridge authorities dropped the charges against Gates on Tuesday . In a statement , the International Association of Chiefs of Police expressed disappointment in Obama 's remarks . `` Police chiefs understand that it is critically important to have all the facts on any police matter before drawing conclusions or making any public statement , '' said Russell B. Laine , association president and chief of the Algonquin , Illinois , police department , in the statement . `` For these reasons , the IACP was disappointed in the president 's characterization of the Cambridge Police Department . '' Haas ' comments followed a statement earlier Thursday from Crowley , who said he would not apologize for his actions . `` That apology will never come from me as Jim Crowley . It wo n't come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department , '' Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI . `` Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department , which are beyond my control , I do n't worry about that . I know what I did was right . I have nothing to apologize for . '' The mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city 's police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates ' arrest does not happen again . `` This suggests that something happened that should not have happened , '' E. Denise Simmons , Cambridge 's mayor said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` The situation is certainly unfortunate . This ca n't happen again in Cambridge . '' Obama defended Gates Wednesday night , while acknowledging that he may be `` a little biased , '' because Gates is a friend . `` But I think it 's fair to say , No. 1 , any of us would be pretty angry ; No. 2 , that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home ; and , No. 3 ... that there 's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately . '' The incident , Obama said , shows `` how race remains a factor in this society . '' Crowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist . In fact , Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy , said Deborah Friedl , deputy superintendent of the police department . Last year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course , Friedl said . `` He seems to be a highly regarded # instructor at the academy . He consistently received high praise from students , '' she said . Gates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped , he will keep the issue alive . `` This is not about me ; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America , '' Gates told CNN 's Soledad O'Brien . Gates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident . Simmons , Cambridge 's first black female mayor , confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates . Gates said he 'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer `` if he told the truth '' about what the director of Harvard 's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were `` fabrications '' in the police report . iReport.com : Join the conversation on racial profiling Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him , and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in , Gates opened the front door and exclaimed , `` Why , because I 'm a black man in America ? '' The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification , but eventually produced a Harvard identification card , prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police . `` While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence , I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me , '' Crowley said , according to the report . Gates was arrested for `` loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space '' and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station . He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions , not excluding a lawsuit . Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him , `` I would do the same thing exactly again .

Stevens , who has also had spells in charge of Hertha Berlin , Hamburg and PSV Eindhoven , has signed a two-year deal . `` Huub Stevens , who coached the Royal Blues from 1996 to 2002 , has returned to his former stomping ground with immediate effect , '' read a statement on the club 's official website . `` Stevens has put pen to paper on a contract to 30 June 2013 . '' Schalke currently sit fifth in Germany 's top division , having won four and lost three of their opening seven matches . As Schalke appointed a new coach , Laudrup ended his one-year tenure in charge of Mallorca . Laudrup , who represented Denmark on 104 occasions , announced his decision to leave the club at a press conference on Tuesday . The former Spartak Moscow coach made the decision due to his relationship with club owner Lorenzo Serra Ferrer becoming damaged beyond repair . `` This situation can not continue like this , '' Laudrup , 47 , said . `` From now on , Mallorca will be whatever it is Serra Ferrer wants . '' Laudrup guided Mallorca to a 17th-place finish last season as the one-time Copa del Rey winners avoided relegation by just one point . The club sold star midfielder Jonathan de Guzman to Spanish rivals Villarreal in August and Laudrup saw his assistant Erik Larsen sacked on Monday . `` Yesterday one of my assistants was fired , '' he said . `` Once again , it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to find the peace required to work here . `` The team is hurt by this situation . What we need is calm and I can not go home every night , angry , disappointed . I have a family . '' Laudrup 's final game in charge was a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad on Sunday , and his former charges travel to Osasuna on Saturday .","question":""}
{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 47-year-old Virginia man was charged Monday with interfering with a flight crew during a flight last week in which he allegedly became intoxicated and unruly , leading authorities to scramble fighter jets and the pilot to make an emergency landing . The incident occurred Friday when Muhammad Abu Tahir , a Pakistani national and lawful permanent U.S. resident of Glen Allen , Virginia , was aboard AirTran Airways Flight 39 from Atlanta , Georgia , to San Francisco , California . During the flight , a flight attendant served Tahir , seated in coach , three airplane-serving-sized bottles of wine , then refused to serve him more , according to a two-page affidavit filed Monday by the FBI . He appealed to the senior flight attendant , who granted him a fourth , then a fifth bottle , both of which he downed quickly , it said . Tahir then went to a bathroom in the rear of the plane and closed the door , opening it a few minutes later and placing his shoes and socks outside the door , then retreating back inside , the affidavit said . `` A short time later , Tahir again opened the lavatory door revealing that he was shaving with no shirt on , '' it added . When a flight attendant knocked on the door and encouraged him to leave the bathroom so others could use it , Tahir refused `` and started yelling at the flight attendant that he was being disrespected , '' it said . Notified of the passenger 's behavior , the captain advised the senior flight attendant to enlist the help of a passenger to stand outside the lavatory in case help was needed , it said . But Tahir continued yelling and refused to obey the crew , at one point grabbing the senior flight attendant by her arms and hands , releasing her only after a passenger interceded , the affidavit said . By this time , a fire extinguisher had been carried to the rear of the plane for possible use against the man and a beverage cart was repositioned to contain Tahir , according to the affidavit . While Tahir remained inside the lavatory , the pilot made an emergency landing in Colorado Springs , Colorado , where police officers took Tahir to the El Paso County Jail , where he remained Monday . Tahir told the FBI that he felt he was being disrespected when the flight attendants denied his request for food , which was being served in business class , the affidavit said . The charges Tahir faces will be read Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Denver and a detention hearing and preliminary hearing are to be scheduled for later in the week . `` It is crucial that the flying public obey the commands of the flight crew , '' said U.S. Attorney David Gaouette . If convicted , Tahir faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine , or both , as well as restitution to the airline . The incident was the second in three days in which North American Aerospace Defense Command fighter jets were scrambled in response to a passenger deemed disruptive . On Wednesday , NORAD escorted a Hawaii-bound plane back to its origination city of Portland , Oregon , after a passenger gave a flight attendant a note that was interpreted as being threatening . The passenger , Joseph Hedlund Johnson , 56 , told the FBI he had n't intended to scare anyone with the note , which began , `` I thought I was going to die , '' and referenced the television show `` Gilligan 's Island .

{"answer":"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three people died Thursday when a medical helicopter crashed in western Tennessee , the Federal Aviation Administration said . The helicopter had dropped off a patient in Jackson , Tennessee , and was returning to Brownsville , Tennessee , about 30 miles west of Jackson , when the crash was reported , said FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford . Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Jeremy Heidt said the crash occurred shortly after 6 a.m. Three people were initially reported to be on board the helicopter , Lunsford said . All three were believed to be fatalities , as the aircraft -- a Eurocopter AS350 -- was burned , he said . Investigators were en route to the scene of the crash , a field near Brownsville , Lunsford said . CNN affiliate WMC-TV said the helicopter was operated by Hospital Wing . The organization identifies itself on its Web site as the Memphis Medical Center 's air ambulance service . Hospital Wing said in a statement , reported by WMC-TV , that the crash occurred just east of Brownsville , and that three crew members and no patients were on board . The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are investigating , the statement said . `` Nothing like this has ever happened in our history , '' Allen Burnette , Hospital Wing 's director and chief operating officer , said in the statement . `` A weather report said there were thunderstorms in the area , but that they had passed , Lunsford said . `` The big weather system moving through had stopped a few moments before . '' Officials believe the helicopter was operating under a visual flight rules plan and not communicating with air traffic controllers , he said . Visual Flight Rules , or VFR , mean a flight is conducted under visual conditions . `` There are operating guidelines in any aviation operation , but ultimately the pilot is responsible for -LRB- the -RRB- safety of -LRB- the -RRB- aircraft and deciding whether to go forward or not , '' Lunsford said .

{"answer":"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A leading Muslim-American group lashed out at the federal government Friday for moving to seize assets -- including four mosques -- that belong to a foundation and a corporation believed linked to Iran . `` The American Muslim and faith communities must not allow houses of worship to become pawns in geopolitical struggles , '' said Imam Mahdi Bray , executive director of the Muslim American Society 's Freedom Foundation . `` The tension between the United States and Iran must not be played out in the mosques of America . '' Federal prosecutors say their actions against assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp. , which also include a Manhattan skyscraper , are not an effort to target mosques . `` There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants , '' said Yusill Scribner , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement Thursday . `` The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today 's filing . '' A senior Justice Department official told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings , not seizing mosques as religious-oriented facilities . The mosques -- in New York , Maryland , California and Texas -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question , the official said . But the Muslim American Society 's Freedom Foundation called the actions an `` unprecedented encroachment of religious freedom . '' The group said `` it is an abiding concern among the American Muslim community that this action is just the beginning of a backlash after last week 's Fort Hood shooting tragedy . '' A Muslim-American soldier is accused in a Fort Hood , Texas , shooting spree that left 13 people dead and dozens injured . The Council on American-Islamic Relations , another leading Muslim-American group , issued a statement Thursday saying the government 's actions may have First Amendment implications . `` Whatever the details of the government 's case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide , '' said Ibrahim Hooper , the national communications director for the council . The controversy erupted after prosecutors in New York filed an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. . They include properties owned by the foundation in several states . A 36-story office tower in midtown Manhattan is owned by the 650 Fifth Avenue Company , a partnership between Alavi and Assa , the Justice Department said . The complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli , Iran 's largest state-owned financial entity . U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force , considered terrorist groups by the United States . Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in deceptive banking practices . Prosecutors allege the properties at issue were `` involved in and -LSB- were -RSB- the proceeds of money laundering offenses , '' and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations . `` As today 's complaint alleges in great detail , the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran , '' Preet Bharara , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , said on Thursday . `` For two decades , the Alavi Foundation 's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials , including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations , in violation of a series of American laws . The Alavi Foundation 's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice , and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing . '' John Winter , a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation , said his client would challenge the complaint . `` We 're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter , '' he said . `` It may take some time , but at the end of this litigation , we 're of the mind that we 're going to prevail here . '' The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual . When a CNN reporter arrived at one of the seized mosques -- in Queens , a New York City borough -- he found it to be operating normally . There was a copy of the federal complaint taped to the front door of the building , but the doors were open and people were coming and going . Calls to the Iranian Mission for comment were not immediately returned . A report Friday on the Web site of Iran 's state-run Press TV did not contain any responses from Iranian officials .
