0,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , has died at age 93 , according to his family . Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam . McNamara was a member of Kennedy 's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war . But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam , overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops . Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed `` McNamara 's War , '' he later said both administrations were `` terribly wrong '' to have pursued military action beyond 1963 . `` External military force can not reconstruct a failed state , and Vietnam , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the `` Cold War '' documentary series . `` We did n't recognize it as such . '' A native of San Francisco , McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master 's degree in business from Harvard . He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II , when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency . After the war , he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family . A month later , the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the `` whiz kids '' who joined the young president 's administration . In October 1962 , after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba , McNamara was one of Kennedy 's top advisers in the standoff that followed . The United States imposed a naval `` quarantine '' on Cuba , a Soviet ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion . The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba , a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people . In the 2003 documentary `` The Fog of War , '' McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to `` put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes . '' But he added , `` In the end , we lucked out . It was luck that prevented nuclear war . '' McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon , computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military 's vast purchasing and personnel system . And in Vietnam , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war . Metrics such as use of `` body counts '' and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict . McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand . He , Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia . But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union , which backed communist North Vietnam , McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon . `` The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , '' he told CNN . Casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war . In 1965 , a Quaker anti-war protester , Norman Morrison , set himself on fire outside McNamara 's office window . In 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon , which was ringed with troops . By November 1967 , McNamara told Johnson that there was `` no reasonable way '' to end the war quickly , and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon . By the end of that month , Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank . But by March 1968 , Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara . He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election . After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968 , McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank . He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir , `` In Retrospect . '' `` You do n't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear , '' he told Morris . `` A lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me . A lot of people think I 'm a son of a bitch . ''",Which president was McNamara with ?,John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson

9,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former federal prosecutor was arrested Wednesday on charges related to the murder of a witness in a drug case , among many other counts , the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Newark , New Jersey , said . Former federal prosecutor Paul Bergrin is charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included a murder . Paul Bergrin and three others were taken into custody after a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted them on 14 counts , including murder , racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering charges , a statement from Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. said . The indictment charges Bergrin with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included the murder of a witness in a drug case and an attempt to hire a hit man in another drug case , the statement said . Bergrin also is charged with wire fraud and money laundering , Marra said . Gerald Shargel , Bergrin 's attorney , said his client would plead not guilty to all charges . `` This is largely dredging up old issues , and we intend to vigorously fight the charges , '' Shargel said . The U.S. Attorney 's Office statement said Bergrin was involved in the murder of a confidential witness in one federal drug case and tried to hire a Chicago , Illinois , hit man to kill a witness in another drug case . The second killing never occurred , the statement said , because the proposed hit man was a cooperating witness in the case . Marra called Bergrin 's alleged conduct `` simply shocking . '' `` A licensed lawyer , a former prosecutor essentially became one of the criminals he represents , supporting , encouraging , indeed directing , a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder and murder conspiracies , drug trafficking and financial fraud , '' Marra said in the statement . `` Bergrin can now expect to feel the full weight of the very legal system he turned on its head with his conduct .

10,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama will address the future of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Thursday morning in a speech at the National Archives . The Guantanamo facility houses terror suspects , and lawmakers do n't want them in the U.S. . In a speech that is being billed as a major address , Obama is also slated to discuss issues of state secrets , transparency and protecting national security , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . Former Vice President Dick Cheney , one of the most outspoken critics of Obama 's policies , is scheduled to give an opposing argument Thursday morning . Cheney has charged that Obama 's national security decisions have left the United States more vulnerable to attack . Obama 's address is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET at the National Archives . Cheney will speak before the conservative American Enterprise Institute at 10:45 a.m. Obama is hoping to rally support behind his national security measures after angering some with his decision to resume the Bush administration practice of military tribunals and by reversing course on his decision to release photos of alleged inmate abuse at Guantanamo . On Wednesday , Obama was dealt another blow when the U.S. Senate passed a measure that would prevent detainees at Guantanamo Bay from being transferred to the United States for now . The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in a 90-6 vote . A similar amendment has already passed the House . It was attached to a supplemental war funding bill . Following in the steps of House Democrats , Senate Democrats rejected on Tuesday the administration 's request for $ 80 million to close the Guantanamo facility . They instead asked that President Obama first submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the prison . Obama , in one of his first official duties as president , announced that he would close the prison by January 22 , 2010 . Congressional Democrats , however , are now attempting to avoid an onslaught of criticism from Republicans , who argue it would be reckless to shutter the prison before deciding where to transfer the detainees . FBI Director Robert Mueller told members of Congress earlier Wednesday that he is concerned about the potential dangers that may result from the release of detainees in the United States . In response to a question from Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , Mueller said he is concerned about the potential for fundraising to support terrorist groups and the radicalization of others , as well as the potential for attacks within the country . Mueller also said that while he is not concerned about dangerous terrorists escaping from maximum security federal prisons , he is concerned about the potential of activities being directed from within prison walls , and he cited such actions by dangerous gang members . Attorney General Eric Holder , the president 's point man overseeing the Guantanamo plan , sought to downplay the FBI director 's concerns and the Senate vote to bar funds . `` The concerns that have been expressed by the director and concerns expressed by other people will all be taken into account in formulating the plan that we will ultimately use , '' Holder told reporters late Wednesday . `` We 're not going to do anything that 's going to put the American people at risk , '' he said . The attorney general continued to express confidence that the Guantanamo Bay prison camp will be permanently closed by Obama 's deadline . iReport.com : Sound off on Obama , Cheney speeches `` We will have conversations with Congress , and I 'm confident that as a result of those conversations , the necessary funds will come our way , '' Holder said . At the White House , press secretary Robert Gibbs echoed Holder 's promise . `` The president understands that his most important job is to keep the American people safe and that he is not going to make any decision or any judgment that imperils the safety of the American people .

15,"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday , officials said . A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions , police said . Lohan 's attorney told CNN the warrant was issued `` out of a misunderstanding . '' It was not known whether she would attend the hearing Monday . The warrant was issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills , California . It apparently stems from Lohan 's 2007 convictions for drunken driving , police said Friday . She is serving three years probation . Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation . The district attorney 's office prosecuted the original 2007 case , she said . The hearing is set to begin sometime after 8:30 a.m. , she said . Lohan `` has the right to appear '' at the hearing , said Alan Parachini , Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman . `` That decision is up to her . '' Lohan 's attorney , Shawn Chapman Holley , told CNN on Sunday that she will appear at the hearing on Lohan 's behalf . `` Since her case was resolved , Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court , '' Holley said in a statement . `` The warrant issued on Friday was , in our view , born out of a misunderstanding which I am confident I can clear up next week , '' Holley said . Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan , as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases . Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in . Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges , with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident . The first arrest , in May 2007 , came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills . Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility , she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car . A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges . Lohan 's acting career , which started at age 10 on a soap opera , took off on the big screen a year later when she played both identical twins in Disney 's `` The Parent Trap . '' Since then , she has starred in at least a dozen movies , including `` Georgia Rule '' with Jane Fonda in 2007 . Her pop music recording career , boosted by her movie roles , has floundered in the past year . Her last album was released in 2005 .

William George , president of the Georgetown Preparatory School in Washington . `` Lawmaking should be sacred work , and Jack knew that .

'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who led a bipartisan delegation to the funeral , remembered her long-time ally . `` Those who served with him were honored to call him a colleague , '' Pelosi said . `` There were those of us who were privileged to call him friend .

'' Murtha underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gall bladder January 28 at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland . He was released but rehospitalized a few days later after the complications developed . The operation had been scheduled after Murtha was hospitalized for a few days in December . Murtha represented Pennsylvania 's 12th Congressional District in the House since 1974 , making him the chamber 's eighth most senior member . Two days before he died , Murtha became the state 's longest-serving congressman . He also was the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress , his biography on the House Web site says . Murtha was considered one of `` the kings of pork '' on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups for requesting tens of millions of dollars in earmarks . The congressman strongly defended earmarks , saying on his Web site , `` I believe that elected representatives of the people understand their constituents and districts best . '' Supporters said his efforts helped bring thousands of jobs to western Pennsylvania . Born June 17 , 1932 , in West Virginia , Murtha moved with his family to Pennsylvania as a child . Prior to joining the House of Representatives , he served in the Pennsylvania state legislature . He also served 37 years in the Marines and Marine Corps Reserves . He retired from the Reserves in 1990 and received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal . Murtha attended Washington and Jefferson College but dropped out in 1952 to enlist in the Marines . He later graduated from the University of Pittsburgh . He is survived by his wife , Joyce , daughter , Donna , and two sons . `` When they made dad , they broke the mold , '' Donna Murtha said during the funeral . `` He lived by the motto , one man can make a difference .

Kerik reported to the medium-security facility , which houses some 500 inmates , at approximately 1 p.m. ET , authorities said . Kerik -- nominated by President George Bush in 2004 to be homeland security adviser , only to later withdraw from consideration -- was sentenced to four years in prison last February .

'' He said he made his two daughters watch the movie `` Rocky Balboa '' for the scene in which Sylvester Stallone 's character tells his son that the world can be an unfair place but one has to persevere . `` As I prepare to serve my sentence , I have had to likewise prepare Angelina and Celine , my 7 - and 10-year-old daughters for what is next to come , and had to teach them that there are times when we are put in situations which are beyond our control and that no matter how undeserved , unsought , or unwanted , we must find the strength , courage , and perseverance to carry on and move forward . '' Kerik , 54 , pleaded guilty in November to tax fraud and six other felonies . He has been under house arrest in Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , since then . In court papers , prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was `` any possible concern '' about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating his apartment or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors . Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on various corruption charges , including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York . He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts in November . Kerik was New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 , a tenure that included the September 11 , 2001 , attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people . He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country 's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003 , and President Bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004 . However , Kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status . In 2006 , he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while working as city corrections commissioner . Under his plea agreement , he paid $ 221,000 in fines and avoided jail time . His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who said his endorsement of Kerik had been `` a mistake . '' Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in 2008 , according to court papers released in October . Kerik 's sentence exceeded the 27 - to 33-month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors . `` With great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences , '' said U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson during the sentencing on February 18 . Kerik ended his blog post Sunday , saying : `` Finally , I can only hope that history will judge me based on my 30 years of public service to our great nation , and not by tabloid headlines , my imperfections , or the mistakes that I may have made .

28,"HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Robert Mugabe 's political rivals Saturday accused the Zimbabwean president of `` ambush '' in allocating key ministries to his own party in defiance of a power-sharing agreement aimed at ending political turmoil in the country . The opposition MDC accuses Mugabe of `` ambush . '' Zimbabwe 's state-run Herald newspaper reported that ministries inlcuding defense , justice , and media , were being placed in the hands of Mugabe 's ZANU-PF . Party spokesman Bright Matonga said the move had cross-party support but the Movement for Democratic Change 's Nelson Chamisa decried the move is an `` ambush '' that puts the power-sharing deal in jeopardy . Under the deal reached last month , Mugabe stays in office but shares power with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai , who became vice president . Arthur Mutambara , who leads a splinter MDC faction , became deputy vice president . `` The MDC dismisses ZANU-PF 's unilaterally gazetted wish list of ministries , which is a betrayal of the wishes , expectations and aspirations of the majority of Zimbabweans , '' the MDC said in a statement . `` It is a giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy . '' The plan outlined in The Herald would give 14 government ministries to ZANU-PF and 13 to the MDC . Three ministries would go to Mutambara 's faction . Among the ministries reportedly allocated to ZANU-PF are defense , home affairs , foreign affairs , justice and legal affairs , and media and information . Ministries given to Tsvangirai 's MDC would include constitutional and parliamentary affairs , economic planning , health , labor , and sport , arts and culture , the paper said . Mutambara would oversee education , industry and commerce , and regional integration and international cooperation . The ministry of finance , the paper said , remains in dispute . The MDC accused the ZANU-PF of trying to undermine the work of former South African President Thabo Mbeki , who helped broker a deal to end months of violence following a disputed election . The paper said Mbeki was due to to go Zimbabwe to resolve the question of the finance ministry . Mbeki mediated the power-sharing talks that aimed to resolve the disputed March election . Tsvangirai won the most votes in March but not enough to avoid a runoff , according to the government 's official count . Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote , saying Mugabe 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters .",What does MDC mean in Isis,Movement for Democratic Change 's

35,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis , who had a storied career in professional football as a coach , commissioner and owner , died Saturday , the team said . He was 82 . In a brief post on their website , the Raiders said a statement would be issued later in the day . The cause of death was not immediately released . Much of Davis ' career was spent in Oakland , where he first arrived as a coach in 1963 -- tasked with turning around a team that was picked to be at the bottom of the standings . The results were almost immediate , finishing 10-4 that season , and Davis was selected as coach of the year . At 33 , he was both the coach and general manager of the Raiders , the website said , making him the youngest person to hold that dual position . His career started in 1950 as a line coach at Adelphi College in New York , the Raiders website said . He also coached at The Citadel , Southern California and for the then-Los Angeles Chargers before going to the Raiders . According to the Raiders website , by the time he arrived in Oakland , Davis had already been labeled a `` young coaching genius '' by Sports Illustrated . As commissioner of the American Football League in 1966 , he played a role in the merger of that league with the National Football League . Davis ' story , the Raiders website said , `` is a standard that no one in the history of professional football can match for winning and excellence . '' He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 1992 . `` Al Davis 's passion for football and his influence on the game were extraordinary , '' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on his Twitter account . `` The respect he commanded was evident in the way that people listened carefully every time he spoke . He is a true legend of the game whose impact and legacy will forever be part of the NFL . '' New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson also shared his sympathy on the news of Davis ' death . `` Al Davis was one of the most innovative and dynamic pioneers in the history of the National Football League . He was passionate about his team and about the game of professional football and he personified the legacy of the Raiders , '' he said .",Who was the owner of the Oakland Raiders ?,Al Davis
42,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British woman who suffers from multiple sclerosis has lost her appeal to clarify Britain 's laws on assisted suicide , a charity working with the woman said Thursday . Debbie Purdy and husband Omar Puente pictured outside the High Court in October 2008 . But the woman did get a strong hint that anyone who helped her travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal would not be prosecuted . Debbie Purdy , 45 , had asked the Court of Appeal to clarify Britain 's laws on assisted suicide -- an option she has said she wants if her pain one day becomes unbearable . Under the current laws , Purdy says , it is not clear at which point her husband would be breaking the law if he helped her to travel to an assisted suicide clinic . Purdy was appealing an October ruling by the High Court , which also refused to clarify the laws . Purdy suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis , in which symptoms become progressively worse over time . She has said she wants the option to travel abroad to have an assisted death should her condition deteriorate . Under Britain 's current law , Purdy 's husband , Omar Puente , could face 14 years in prison if he accompanies her to a country , such as Switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal . Purdy had asked the High Court judges to tell her at what point Puente would be subject to prosecution -- whether it would include helping her into a car , sitting with her on the plane to the clinic , or helping her with her bags . In its judgment Thursday , the appeal court did imply Puente would be safe from prosecution . The judges referred to the earlier case of Dan James , a 23-year-old British rugby player who died in an assisted suicide last year . James had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident . James ' parents , Mark and Julie James , flew with their son to an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland . They faced questions on their return to Britain but were not prosecuted . The court said the decision not to prosecute the Jameses `` is illustrative not only of the care with which the issue in these cases would be approached , but also an extremely helpful example of the kind of broad circumstances in which ... the ultimate decision would be that a prosecution should not be mounted , '' according to an excerpt released by Dignity in Dying , the charity that worked on Purdy 's case . `` If the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process , the court will dismiss it , '' the court said in its judgment . Purdy said that wording made her feel like she had won her argument , even though she lost the appeal . `` I am very grateful for , and respect the ruling of the appeal court , '' she said in a statement . `` They have done everything they can do to clarify that , given the Dan James judgment , Omar would be unlikely to be prosecuted if he were to accompany me abroad for an assisted death , and we are therefore one step closer to the clarification I need . '' Dignity in Dying has said it is important for the British government to distinguish between people who maliciously encourage suicide and those who accompany a loved one abroad to die . Under current law , the 1961 Suicide Act , assisting a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment . Anyone who aids , abets , counsels or procures the suicide of another , or an attempt by another to commit suicide , is liable . Dignity in Dying has said it ultimately wants British law changed to allow the terminally ill the choice of assisted death . To date , no one who has accompanied a loved one to the Swiss clinic Dignitas has been prosecuted , but they have been questioned by police and threatened with prosecution , according to Dignity in Dying . `` The courts have done all they can , '' said Sarah Wootton , chief executive of Dignity in Dying . `` They make quite clear that only Parliament has the authority to change the law . If there 's no public interest in prosecuting , there must be a public interest in updating the law to remove doubt .

43,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A group of native Hawaiians occupied the grounds of the old Hawaiian monarchy 's royal residence Wednesday , vowing to stay and do the business of the kingdom 's government . `` It is through a greater realm than ours '' that the group took this action , said Mahealani Kahau , elected leader of the group , called Hawaiian Kingdom Government . `` Today and every day , we will be here to assume our role . '' The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii -- overthrew the kingdom 's government . The monarchist groups say the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally . Hawaii 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday 's action . The staff of Iolani Palace , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors . The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action . The group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed . `` It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , '' said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio , who added that although she is a native Hawaiian , she does not understand the actions of the group . Ascencio also said the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security . Jose Carrion , a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico , told Honolulu 's KHON-TV that he was disappointed he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and `` learn about the culture of the Hawaiians . '' `` We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy , '' said Carrion , who said he had reservations for the visit . `` But we 're leaving tomorrow , so we wo n't get to see the palace . '' Carrion also said he `` kind of understood '' the actions of the group . Puerto Rico and Hawaii , along with Guam and the Philippines , were annexed into the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War . Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories of the United States . The Philippines gained independence after World War II , and Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 . Although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on King David Kalakaua , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms . The document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and Hawaiian landowners , barring 75 percent of the native Hawaiian population and all Asians . When Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document . With the help of John L. Stevens , the U.S. minister to Hawaii , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions . Two years later , under threat of U.S. troops , she yielded her authority , saying , `` Until such time as the government of the United States shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands . '' The queen was later imprisoned in Iolani Palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release . She died in 1917 at 79 . In 1993 , the U.S. Congress approved , and President Bill Clinton signed , an apology to the people of the Hawaiian islands . The document `` acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum . '' Although it was used as a seat of government for decades after Lili'uokalani 's reign , the palace fell into disrepair . When the last of the government offices moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began . It opened to the public in 1978 .

54,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mumia Abu-Jamal sits on Pennsylvania 's death row , perhaps the most recognized of the 228 condemned inmates at the Greene Correctional Facility , an hour south of Pittsburgh . Former radio host and convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal during a 1994 interview Abu-Jamal , inmate AM8335 , awaits three milestones . His new book , `` Jailhouse Lawyers , '' will be released next month . He 's also awaiting a pair of Supreme Court decisions , which could come in the next two weeks . The former Black Panther was sentenced to die for gunning down a Philadelphia police officer 28 years ago . The high court will decide whether he deserves a new hearing to determine whether his execution should go forward . The state is appealing a federal appeals court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu-Jamal 's favor last year . The case has attracted international attention . Abu-Jamal 's lawyers filed a separate appeal claiming that racism led to his 1982 conviction . That petition is scheduled for consideration by the Supreme Court on April 3 . If either case is accepted by the justices for review , oral arguments would be held in the fall . The former radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial . Others counter that Abu-Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions . They say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism . He was convicted for the December 9 , 1981 , murder of officer Daniel Faulkner , 25 , in Philadelphia . Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal 's brother in a late-night traffic stop . Witnesses said Abu-Jamal , who was nearby , ran over and shot the police officer in the back and in the head . Abu-Jamal , once known as Wesley Cook , was also wounded in the confrontation and later admitted to the killing , according to other witnesses ' testimony . Abu-Jamal is black , and the police officer was white . Incarcerated for nearly three decades , Abu-Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system . On a Web site created by friends to promote his release , the prisoner-turned-author writes about his fight . `` This is the story of law learned , not in the ivory towers of multi-billion dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave-ship , in the hidden , dank dungeons of America . '' His chief defense attorney , Robert Bryan , has filed appeals asking for a new criminal trial . `` The central issue in this case is racism in jury selection , '' he wrote to supporters last month . `` We are in an epic struggle in which his life hangs in the balance . What occurs now in the Supreme Court will determine whether Mumia will have a new jury trial or die at the hands of the executioner , '' Bryan said . Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced him to death . A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals kept the murder conviction in place a year ago but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing . `` The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , '' Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica wrote in the 77-page opinion . The federal appeals court ultimately concluded that the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh `` mitigating factors '' offered by the defense that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row . Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance , such as the fact that Abu-Jamal had no prior criminal record . Months before that ruling , oral arguments on the issue were contentious . Faulkner 's widow and Abu-Jamal 's brother attended , and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia . If the Supreme Court refuses now to intervene on the sentencing issue , the city 's prosecutor would have to decide within six months whether to conduct a new death penalty sentencing hearing or allow Abu-Jamal to spend the rest of his life in state prison . Many prominent groups and individuals , including singer Harry Belafonte , the NAACP and the European Parliament , are cited on his Web site as supporters . Prosecutors have insisted that Abu-Jamal pay the price for his crimes and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row for Faulkner 's murder . `` This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu-Jamal is some kind of a folk hero , '' Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said last year , when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction . `` He is nothing short of an assassin . '' The city has honored the fallen police officer with a street designation and a commemorative plaque placed at the spot where he was shot and killed . The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , wrote a book two years ago about her husband and the case : `` Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Loss , Pain and Injustice . '' She writes that she was trying to `` definitively lay out the case against Mumia Abu-Jamal and those who 've elevated him to the status of political prisoner .

55,"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens , dignitaries and politicians . South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday . The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament , with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers . The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim , who died Tuesday of a heart failure . Kim 's age at the time of his death was in dispute , with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83 . Kim 's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said . Another president , Park Chung-hee , was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979 . Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea . The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953 . But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor , Roh Moo-hyun . Ahead of the funeral , President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation , who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries . Lee , in turn , reiterated his government 's firm stance , presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan was quoted as saying by Yonhap . But in a possible sign that icy relations between the two rival nations are nevertheless thawing , South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday . It was the first high-level , cross-border contact in nearly two years . The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year . Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan . The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters . South Korea condemned the action , calling the launches `` provocative '' and `` unwise . '' CNN 's Jake Perez contributed to this report .",Who is former president of South Korea ?,Kim Dae-Jung
57,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health , according to a statement from his doctor , released by the campaign . Besides being an `` intermittent smoker , '' Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health , his doctor says . Obama , 46 , last saw Dr. David Scheiner in January 2007 , shortly before he declared he was running for president . Scheiner , who has been Obama 's primary doctor since 1987 , observed that the Illinois senator 's diet , weight , blood pressure and cholesterol were all healthy . `` In short , his examination showed him to be in excellent health , '' Scheiner said . Obama `` exercised regularly , often jogging three miles . His diet was balanced with good intake of roughage and fluids . ... On physical examination , his blood pressure was 90/60 and pulse 60/minute , '' Scheiner wrote . The Illinois senator has been an `` intermittent '' cigarette smoker who has `` quit on several occasions and is currently using Nicorette gum with success . '' Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president , released his health records last week . McCain 's doctors also described him as being in `` excellent health , '' despite a history of skin cancer , and said there appears to be no physical reason why the 71-year-old candidate could not carry out the duties of the office . Obama released a one-page statement from his primary care physician . He did not release any medical records or make his doctors available to the media . By contrast , McCain made more than 1,000 pages of medical documents available to journalists , including CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta . Four of McCain 's doctors held a conference call with reporters after the records were made available . McCain has had four malignant melanomas removed . Three of them -- on his left shoulder , left arm and left nasal wall -- were limited to the top skin layer and were not invasive . They were removed in 1993 , 2000 and 2002 . But a fourth melanoma proved to be invasive and was removed from his left lower temple in 2000 , said Dr. John D. Eckstein , an internist who has been overseeing McCain 's treatment for 16 years at the Mayo Clinic 's campus in Scottsdale , Arizona .",What product is Obama using to quit smoking ?,Nicorette gum
58,"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The autopsy on Corey Haim revealed the actor 's heart was enlarged and his lungs were filled with water when he died , Haim 's manager said . The Los Angeles County coroner told Haim 's mother that her son suffered from pulmonary congestion , manager Mark Heaslip said . Heaslip said this was evidence that Haim 's death was not caused by a drug overdose , but Brian Elias with the coroner 's office said they are waiting for toxicology tests before deciding what killed Haim . The 1980s teen movie actor , who struggled for decades with drug addiction , died early Wednesday after collapsing in the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother , authorities said . Longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman asked Wednesday that people not `` jump the gun '' to conclude a drug overdose killed Haim . Heaslip , manager to both Feldman and Haim , said he seemed to be winning his battle against drug abuse in the weeks before his death . Haim , 38 , was taken to Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank , California , early Wednesday , where he was pronounced dead at 2:15 a.m. PT -LRB- 5:15 a.m. ET -RRB- , said Ed Winter , Los Angeles County deputy coroner . Haim was in the apartment he shared with his mother , Judy Haim , when he `` became a little dizzy , he kind of went to his knees in the bedroom , '' Winter said . `` His mom assisted him in the bed . He became unresponsive . '' His mother called paramedics to the apartment , which is between Hollywood Hills and Burbank , he said . Haim had suffered from flulike symptoms for two days , the deputy coroner said . `` We found no illicit drugs . However , we did recover four of his prescription meds at the location , '' Winter said , adding he does not know what those drugs were . Haim was `` weaned down to literally zero medications '' in the past two weeks by an addiction specialist , Heaslip said on HLN 's `` Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell '' on Wednesday . The doctor `` put him on a new line of medications , '' Feldman said on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' on Wednesday . Feldman pleaded with people not to draw conclusions that Haim died from a drug overdose . He said that until the autopsy report is issued , `` nobody knows and nobody 's going to know . '' Watch Corey Feldman talk about his friend 's death on `` Larry King Live '' `` I know that there were symptoms that he was showing that expressed it could be a number of things , '' Feldman said . `` This could have been a kidney failure . This could have been a heart failure . '' Heaslip that said Haim 's mother , Judy , told him `` there were no signs of him overdosing . '' His death came as his career was picking up , with Haim booking `` movie after movie , '' Heaslip said . His latest film is set for release soon , he said . Haim `` really became a man '' in recent months as he helped his mother in her battle with cancer , Feldman said . `` He 's been there for her , taking care of her , being responsible , '' he said . Feldman said he was angry about how Haim has been snubbed in recent years by the entertainment industry . He was broke , without a car and living in a month-to-month rental apartment with his mother , he said . `` We build people up as children , we put them on pedestals and then when we decide that they are not marketable anymore , we walk away from them , '' he said . Haim 's most famous role was in the 1987 movie `` The Lost Boys , '' in which he appeared with Feldman . Haim played the role of a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire . In later years , the two friends -- who appeared in eight movies together -- struggled with drug abuse and went their separate ways . They reunited for a reality show , `` The Two Coreys , '' in 2007 , but A&E Network canceled the program after slightly more than a year . In a 2007 interview on CNN 's `` Larry King Live , '' Haim and Feldman discussed their battle with drugs . Feldman told King that he had gotten clean , but it took Haim longer . Haim called himself `` a chronic relapser for the rest of my life . '' `` I think I have an addiction to pretty much everything , '' he said . `` I mean , I have to be very careful with myself as far as that goes , which is why I have a support group around me consistently . '' In 2008 , Feldman told People magazine that he would no longer speak to Haim until his former co-star got sober . In a clip from `` The Two Coreys , '' Feldman and his wife , along with two other former teen stars , called on Haim in an effort to get him to admit he needed help , the magazine said . The meeting followed an incident in which Haim , scheduled to film a cameo appearance in a direct-to-DVD sequel to `` The Lost Boys , '' appeared on the set `` clearly under the influence , '' People reported . Feldman told King on Wednesday that he renewed his contact with Haim in the past year because of the progress he made against his addiction . Haim was born December 23 , 1971 , in Toronto , Ontario , according to a biography on his Web site . He made his first television appearance in 1982 on the Canadian series `` The Edison Twins . '' His first film role was in the 1984 movie `` First Born . '' Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film `` Lucas . '' Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time , `` If he continues to act this well , he will never become a half-forgotten child star , but will continue to grow into an important actor . '' Following `` The Lost Boys , '' Haim and Feldman appeared in `` License to Drive '' and `` Dream a Little Dream .

59,"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Crichton , who helped create the TV show `` ER '' and wrote the best-sellers `` Jurassic Park , '' `` The Andromeda Strain , '' `` Sphere '' and `` Rising Sun , '' has died in Los Angeles , his public relations firm said in a news release . Michael Crichton , here in 2005 , was a director and best-selling author . He co-created the TV series `` ER . '' Crichton died unexpectedly Tuesday `` after a courageous and private battle against cancer , '' the release said . He was 66 . Crichton , a medical doctor , was attracted to cautionary science tales . Watch more about the life of Crichton Â '' `` Jurassic Park '' -- perhaps his best-known work -- concerned capturing the DNA of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on a modern island , where they soon run amok ; `` The Andromeda Strain , '' his first major fiction success , involves an alien microorganism that 's studied in a special military compound after causing death in a nearby community . Crichton also invited controversy with some of his scientific views . He was an avowed skeptic of global climate change , giving lectures warning against `` consensus science . '' He later took on global warming and the theories surrounding it in his 2004 novel , `` State of Fear , '' which attracted attacks in its own right from scientists , including NASA climatologist James Hansen . iReport.com : Were you a fan ?

Crichton originally wrote the script for the pilot in 1974 . `` Michael 's talent out-scaled even his own dinosaurs of ` Jurassic Park , ' '' said Spielberg , a friend of Crichton 's for 40 years , according to The Associated Press . `` He was the greatest at blending science with big theatrical concepts , which is what gave credibility to dinosaurs again walking the Earth . ... Michael was a gentle soul who reserved his flamboyant side for his novels . There is no one in the wings that will ever take his place . '' Crichton was `` an extraordinary man . Brilliant , funny , erudite , gracious , exceptionally inquisitive and always thoughtful , '' `` ER '' executive producer John Wells told the AP . `` No lunch with Michael lasted less than three hours and no subject was too prosaic or obscure to attract his interest . Sexual politics , medical and scientific ethics , anthropology , archaeology , economics , astronomy , astrology , quantum physics , and molecular biology were all regular topics of conversation . '' Michael Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942 and grew up in New York 's suburbs . His father was a journalist and Michael loved the writing profession . He went to medical school partly out of a concern he would n't be able to make writing a career , but the success of `` The Andromeda Strain '' in 1969 -- the book was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club and optioned by Hollywood -- made him change his mind , though he still had an M.D. Though most of Crichton 's books were major best-sellers involving science , he could ruffle feathers when he took on social issues . `` Rising Sun '' -LRB- 1992 -RRB- came out during a time when Americans feared Japanese ascendance , particularly when it came to technology . `` Disclosure '' -LRB- 1994 -RRB- was about a sexual harassment case . iReport.com : How did Crichton 's work affect you ?

60,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A double amputee sprinter has won the right to be eligible to compete at this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing after sport 's highest court backed his appeal against a ban imposed by athletics authorities . Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorious competed in two able-bodied athletics meetings in 2007 . The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that South African Oscar Pistorius , who runs on prosthetic blades , is eligible to compete against able-bodied athletes . Pistorius , 21 , who lost both legs below the knees when he was a baby , runs on shock-absorbing carbon-fiber prosthetics that resemble bent skis -- earning him the nickname `` Blade Runner . '' Pistorius , a Paralympic Games champion and world record holder , had lobbied the International Association of Athletics Federations -LRB- IAAF -RRB- to allow him to compete at the Olympics this August , but after extensive tests the IAAF ruled in January that his J-shaped prosthetics qualify as technical aids , which are banned in IAAF-governed sports . The IAAF does allow athletes with prosthetics to compete in able-bodied sports , as long as the IAAF believes they do not give the athlete an unfair edge . But Friday 's ruling by the CAS in Lausanne , Switzerland , overturned that verdict . In a statement , it said that its panel had `` not been persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of a double-amputee '' using Pistorius ' blades . Appeals of court decisions are allowed , but on very limited grounds . But the CAS said it did not exclude the possibility that future scientific tests could be developed which might enable the IAAF to prove that the blades provided Pistorius with an advantage over able-bodied athletes . The South African won gold in the 200 meters , and bronze in the 100 meters at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens . He holds the Paralympic world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters . Since Athens , he has competed in two able-bodied races in which he finished second and last , respectively . Pistorius will have emphasized to the court the disadvantages he feels he has by running with prosthetics , CNN World Sport 's Don Riddell said . `` There are disadvantages when it 's windy , when it 's raining , -LRB- and -RRB- it takes him longer to get up to speed at the start , '' Riddell said . `` He will be hoping that they take everything into consideration and not just rule on how much spring his prosthetic limbs give him . '' In November , the IAAF carried out tests on Pistorius over two days at the German Sport University in Cologne to determine if his prosthetics , known as Cheetah limbs , could be considered a technical aid . A team of more than 10 scientists used high-speed cameras , special equipment to measure ground-reaction forces , and a three-dimensional scanner to record body mass . The scientists concluded Pistorius was able to run with his prosthetic blades at the same speed as able-bodied sprinters with about 25 percent less energy expenditure . Pistorius ' blades gave him an energy return nearly three times higher than the human ankle joint offers in maximum sprinting , they said . Riddell described Friday 's ruling in Pistorius ' favor as `` groundbreaking , '' and said it raised questions about the future of paralympic sports . `` What does this do to the future of the Paralympics if he 's allowed to run in the able-bodied Olympics ? Is he actually doing a disservice to other Paralympic athletes ? Does it cheapen the Paralympic Games ? '' Riddell asked .",What is the name of the sprinter ?,Oscar Pistorious

67,"-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones , it 's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well . Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes , from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030 . The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant , or as its design suggests , more of a dog tag . It 's been available for a while now , but we think it 's still worth it . The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $ 39.99 . Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset , the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile . The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant . Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick , the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it . All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid . They are the Play/Pause key , the track shuffle keys , the volume controls , plus the multifunction Call key . The keys are all made of rubber , and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel . The 3.5 mm headset jack is on the right spine , while the charger jack is on the bottom . On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard . Also on the top is a tiny microphone . Getting the headset set up is pretty simple . Just power it on via the multifunction Call button , and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone . We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem . From there , we could play/pause tracks , skip songs , and adjust the volume , all from the Jabra BT3030 . The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear , but since it has a 3.5 mm headset jack , you can use any headphones of your choosing . Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music , you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command . When there 's an incoming call during music playback , the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone . You can then hit the Call button to answer the call . After you hang up , the music will resume from the paused point . Other features include call-waiting support , the ability to reject calls , plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone , and vice versa . Sound quality was quite good , and comparable to most MP3 players on the market . The bass was a little weak , but the overall quality was decent . Call quality was mixed . While we heard our callers just fine , we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us . They reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well . This seemed to vary from caller to caller , however , so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it . The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory , plus an AC adapter . It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time , 7 hours music streaming , and 9.58 days standby time . © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. . All rights reserved .

80,"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn , one automaker announced Thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the United States , potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen . Tesla unveils its Model S sedan , with a base price of $ 57,400 . The manufacturing plant will be in California . Tesla Motors , maker of a high-end electric sports car , says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California . Thursday 's announcement was made in Hawthorne , California , where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $ 49,900 , after a federal tax credit of $ 7,500 . That 's less than half the price of its first model , the Roadster . Started in 2003 and bankrolled by PayPal millionaire Elon Musk , Tesla has attracted investments from the Silicon Valley elite , among them Google founder Larry Page . It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne . That aerospace company , more commonly known as SpaceX , was founded by Musk in 2002 . SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year . That contract , worth $ 1.6 billion , was won over such industry mainstays as Boeing and Lockheed . The promise of a high-performance , all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup 's first model , the Tesla Roadster , a car with the look , speed and price tag -- a steep $ 109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end , high-performance vehicles . Recently though , the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011 . They 've also had to lay off more than 80 workers , which is about 25 percent of the company 's staff . Nonetheless , Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year . That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster ; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly . The company faces many challenges , the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $ 50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid .",Who owns the Tesla corporation ?,Elon Musk
87,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harold Pinter , the Nobel Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter whose absurdist and realistic works displayed a despair and defiance about the human condition , has died , according to British media reports . He was 78 . The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007 . Pinter 's wife , Lady Antonia Fraser , confirmed his death . Pinter , who had been suffering from cancer , died on Christmas Eve , according to the reports . Fraser told the Guardian newspaper : `` He was a great , and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years . He will never be forgotten . '' Pinter was known for such plays as `` The Birthday Party '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , `` The Homecoming '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , `` No Man 's Land '' -LRB- 1974 -RRB- , `` Mountain Language '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , and `` Celebration '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary `` Pinter pause '' -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations . His movie credits , like his plays , span the decades and include `` The Quiller Memorandum '' -LRB- 1965 -RRB- and `` The French Lieutenant 's Woman '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play `` Betrayal , '' the story of a doomed love affair told backward , which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley , Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge . He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005 . Pinter 's later plays were more overtly political , with works such as `` One for the Road '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` The New World Order '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- focusing on state torture . In commentaries , he became a blistering critic of the United States , writing in his Nobel lecture that the country `` quite simply does n't give a damn about the United Nations , international law or critical dissent , which it regards as impotent and irrelevant . It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead , the pathetic and supine Great Britain . '' But Pinter could also be a man of great humor . In 2006 , he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier . `` Two days later , I woke up to find that I 'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature , '' he said . `` So life is really full of ups and downs , you see . '' Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10 , 1930 . He was the son of Jewish immigrants , his father a dressmaker , his mother `` a wonderful cook , '' he once recalled . In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts , then as now one of Great Britain 's most renowned drama schools . But the RADA did n't take ; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms . He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work , `` The Room , '' in 1957 . Later that year he wrote `` The Birthday Party , '' a `` comedy of menace , '' in the words of one critic , that helped make Pinter 's reputation -- though , in an irony he could appreciate , after it closed in London due to scathing notices . Ensuing Pinter plays , including `` The Dumb Waiter '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- and `` The Homecoming , '' made him Britain 's most famous playwright , as influential to `` late 20th-century British theater -LSB- as -RSB- Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages , '' CNN.com 's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006 . `` What 's generally meant as a ` Pinter play ' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted , even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat , '' Anderson wrote . Pinter 's plays featured sparse dialogue , often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement . In `` The Birthday Party , '' a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it 's his birthday ; in `` The Homecoming '' -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family , where the wife becomes the center of attention . Pinter credited Samuel Beckett , among others , as an influence . -LRB- He starred in a production of Beckett 's `` Krapp 's Last Tape '' in 2006 . -RRB- In turn , writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter 's elliptical lead . `` One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness , '' Pinter once said . He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant . Following a 1980 divorce , Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser .",Who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005 ?,Harold Pinter

92,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Robert Byrd came to Congress from West Virginia , a postage stamp cost 3 cents and kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr. Potato Head . On Wednesday , almost 57 years later , Byrd became the longest-serving member of Congress in history . Two days before he turns 92 , the eloquent legislator known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Senate rules and history surpasses Carl T. Hayden , the Arizona Democrat who served a total of 20,773 days in the U.S. House and Senate . With his 20,774 th day representing West Virginia -- six years in House and then nearly 51 years and counting in the Senate -- Byrd sets a record for longevity unlikely to be broken as the political climate turns toward term limits and growing public dissatisfaction with Congress . In a statement issued by his office , Byrd expressed his gratitude to `` the people of the great State of West Virginia '' for their long-standing confidence in him . His only regret , he said , was that his wife , Erma , who died in 2006 , would not be with him . `` I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear Robert -- but do n't let it go to your head , '' Byrd 's statement said . In a career representing the West Virginia coal-mining country from which he emerged , Byrd has cast more Senate votes -LRB- 18,000-plus -RRB- and held more leadership positions -LRB- including two stints as majority leader -RRB- than any other senator . He has never lost an election . He was raised by an aunt and uncle after his mother died when he was a year old , and he did not graduate college until he received a degree in 1994 from Marshall University . In a sign of his Appalachian roots , Byrd was an avid fiddle player and appeared twice on the television program `` Hee Haw . '' He gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands . His early political years displayed some of the deeply rooted racism of the American South . Byrd was a member of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s , and later called it `` the most egregious mistake I 've ever made . '' In 1964 , he voted against the Civil Rights Act pushed by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson . But Byrd later followed a more traditional Democratic path . An ardent foe of President George W. Bush 's policies in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Byrd opposed creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and called Bush `` dangerous , reckless and arrogant '' in February 2003 , six weeks before the Iraq war started . Three months later , he criticized Bush 's landing a jet on the USS Abraham Lincoln to signal the end of the Iraq war as `` flamboyant showmanship . '' On June 12 , 2006 , Byrd became the longest serving senator in history , and was re-elected to his ninth consecutive Senate term five months later . Things have changed since he arrived in Washington as a new congressman in 1953 , along with the first Eisenhower administration . Gas cost 20 cents a gallon then , and the average annual salary was less than $ 4,000 . Ten presidents later , Byrd is known for his devotion to his state and constituents . `` His number one priority has always been the people of West Virginia , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , says in a statement on Byrd 's Senate Web site . `` It has been a great example for all of us to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your state and the people in your state should have first priority . '' Byrd 's statement marking Wednesday 's achievement reflected that thinking . `` Although we are marking a longevity milestone , it has been the quality and dedication of service that has guided me over the years , '' Byrd said in his statement . `` I have strived to provide the people of West Virginia the best representation possible each of the 20,774 days which I have served in the Congress of the United States . '' He thanked his constituents for their support and for `` putting their trust and faith in me . '' Slowed by illness in recent years , including a six-week hospital stay this year because of a staph infection , Byrd concluded his statement with typical bravado . `` The only way for me to close on this historic day is to say that I look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days , '' he said . `` Thank you and may God bless you .

93,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. government has charged an international arms dealer with conspiring to sell a rebel group millions of dollars in weapons `` to be used to kill Americans in Colombia , '' federal prosecutors announced Tuesday . Viktor Bout is accused of selling missiles , rockets and other weapons to FARC , a Colombian rebel group . Viktor Bout , who was recently captured in Thailand , had agreed to sell the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -LRB- FARC -RRB- surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , `` ultralight '' airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release . There was no immediate public response from Bout , who remains in custody in Thailand . Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals , conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . FARC is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department . Justice Department officials said they are seeking Bout 's extradition to the United States . The indictment alleges that Bout made agreements with FARC between November 2007 and March of this year . In their news release , federal prosecutors said Bout agreed to sell weapons `` to two confidential sources '' working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , who had `` represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the FARC , with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack United States helicopters in Colombia . '' The news release also refers to a `` covertly recorded meeting in Thailand on March 6 , 2008 . '' `` With the unsealing of this indictment , we are one step closer to ensuring Bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist , '' DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Loenhart said in the news release . Attorney General Michael Mukasey last month singled out Bout as a leading example of a new breed of organized crime leaders who operate across international boundaries to amass wealth without regard to political ideology . `` Viktor Bout has long been considered by the international community as one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , '' U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in the news release Tuesday . Bout 's assets in the United States were frozen in 2004 after he allegedly shipped weapons to Liberia in violation of U.S. government restrictions .",Arms dealer captured in Thailand .

94,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Philadelphia Eagles welcomed Michael Vick back into the National Football League on Friday after the quarterback spent almost two years in federal prison on a felony dogfighting conviction . Michael Vick speaks at a Philadelphia Eagles news conference on Friday . Vick , formerly with the Atlanta Falcons , has signed a two-year deal with the Eagles . `` I think everybody deserves a second chance , '' Vick said at a news conference in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on Friday . `` Now I want to be part of the solution and not the problem . '' The league suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia . Vick , 29 , was freed from federal prison at Leavenworth , Kansas , on May 20 and returned to his Virginia home to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement . iReport.com : Is this a good move ? `` Everything that happened at that point in my life was wrong , '' Vick said of his involvement with the dogfighting ring . Watch bloggers discuss Vick 's return to the NFL '' `` I had to reach a turning point . Prison definitely did it for me , '' he said . Flanked by Eagles coach Andy Reid and former NFL coach Tony Dungy , who acted as a mentor to Vick after he was imprisoned , the newest Eagle vowed `` to do all the right things . '' `` I want to be an ambassador to the NFL and the community , '' he said . `` I 'm glad I got ... a second chance . I wo n't disappoint . '' Dungy said that he thinks Vick can revive his career and turn his life around in Philadelphia but that the quarterback will be tested by fickle Eagles fans . `` He is gon na have a lot of people who do not think he should be playing . He 's got to prove them wrong on the field and off the field , '' Dungy said . Watch why Dungy thinks Vick will be a positive force '' Earlier reaction to Vick 's signing was mixed . The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said Thursday night in a statement that it was `` incredibly disappointed '' at the news . `` Philadelphia is a city of dog lovers and , most particularly , pit bull lovers , '' said Susan Cosby , the organization 's chief executive officer . `` To root for someone who participated in the hanging , drowning , electrocution and shooting of dogs will be impossible for many , no matter how much we would all like to see the Eagles go all the way . '' However , Ed Sayres , president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , said in a statement that '' -LSB- NFL -RSB- Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Philadelphia Eagles have granted Michael Vick a second chance , and the ASPCA expects Mr. Vick to express remorse for his actions , as well as display more compassion and sound judgment this time around than he did during his previous tenure with the NFL . `` We hope that Mr. Vick uses his stature for the betterment of the community and the advancement of the issue of animal cruelty , '' Sayres said . Reid said he knows that there are some fans who will not accept Vick . `` I understand how that works , '' he said . `` But there 's enough of them that will , and then it 's up to Michael to prove that that change has taken place . I think he 's there . That 's what he wants to do . '' He said Vick `` seems very focused , and he wants to get his career back on track . '' It is unclear what role Vick will play in the Eagles ' offense . But it was clear that the move had the blessing of Eagles starting quarterback Donovan McNabb . `` I pretty much lobbied to get him here , '' McNabb said . `` Because everybody deserves a second chance . '' The NFL reinstated Vick on a conditional basis last month . Vick `` will be considered for full reinstatement and to play in regular-season games by Week 6 based on the progress he makes in his transition plan , '' the league said in a statement last month . Week 6 of the NFL season is in October . Vick may participate in practices , workouts and meetings and may play in his club 's final two preseason games under the conditions of his reinstatement , the league said last month . `` I fully understand that playing football in the NFL is a privilege , not a right , and I am truly thankful for -LSB- the -RSB- opportunity I have been given , '' Vick said in a statement last month upon his reinstatement . Goodell said last month that Vick underwent tests , including a psychiatric evaluation , after requests from animal rights groups . Vick has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . At a hearing in that case , he told the judge he earned 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor while in prison . Court documents released in Vick 's case showed that two of his co-defendants , who also pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal , said that Vick helped kill dogs that did n't fight well and that all three men `` executed approximately eight dogs '' in ways that included hanging and drowning . The dogs were killed because they fared poorly in `` testing '' sessions held at Vick 's property . The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick offered to work with the organization on anti-dogfighting campaigns . Wayne Pacelle , the organization 's president , has said Vick was to work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting and on programs to assist youths who have been involved . In November , Vick pleaded guilty to a state dogfighting charge and received a three-year suspended sentence . The Eagles are scheduled to play Vick 's former team , the Falcons , in Atlanta on December 6 .",who is Eagles head coach ?,Andy Reid
101,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California , Swiss police said Sunday . Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris , France , in June 2009 . Polanski , 76 , was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday , Zurich police said . A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport . He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for '' The Pianist '' in 2003 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl . But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced , and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978 . Watch what happens now for Polanski '' Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for `` Tess '' and `` Chinatown , '' and for best writing for `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' which he also directed . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a Polanski tribute this year , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles , California , after authorities learned Polanski was going to be in Switzerland , Sandi Gibbons , spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , told CNN on Sunday . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put `` in provisional detention . '' But whether he can be extradited to the United States `` can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , '' a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail . `` It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , '' the spokesman wrote . `` Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . '' Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland , but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski 's sentencing process , depending on what happens in Zurich . Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski 's case was handled years ago . According to court documents , Polanski , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial . But the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . Polanski fled the United States for France , where he was born . In the February hearing , Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send Polanski to prison . `` It 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , '' said Espinoza . But he declined to dismiss the case entirely . Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out . Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Following Espinoza 's ruling earlier this year , Geimer 's lawyer , Larry Silver , said he was disappointed and that Espinoza `` did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption . '' He argued in court that had `` Mr. Polanski been treated fairly '' his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime . Polanski 's arrest Saturday came two days after one of his wife 's killers died . The director 's pregnant wife , actress Sharon Tate , and four others were butchered by members of the Manson `` family '' in August 1969 . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Brooke Bowman , Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report .",what film did Polanski win Oscar for best director for ?,The Pianist
102,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United Nations court convicted a former governor of Rwanda to life in prison for his role in a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country . An estimated 800,000 people -- mainly Tutsis -- were killed in Rwanda in 1994 . Tharcisse Renzaho was found guilty of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . The verdict , delivered Tuesday , is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda -LRB- ICTR -RRB- . The U.N. court is holding hearings in Arusha , Tanzania , where it is based . Renzaho was governor of the capital , Kigali , and a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994 during the country 's genocide , when extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda . It began in April of that year and within 100 days , an estimated 800,000 people were killed . The court found that Renzaho ordered soldiers , police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify Tutsi civilians to be executed . It found he ordered the distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis . Renzaho also supervised a selection process at a refugee site where about 40 Tutsis were abducted and killed , the court found . Renzaho participated in an attack at the Sainte Famille church in which more than 100 Tutsis were killed . People across Rwanda sought refuge in churches all over the country as the genocide unfolded . He also made remarks encouraging the sexual abuse of women , according to the court , and was found criminally liable for the rapes that followed . The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre . Renzaho was arrested in September 2002 in the Democratic Republic of Congo . His trial began in January 2007 and closed in September that year after hearing from 53 witnesses , including Renzaho . Throughout the trial , Renzaho maintained his innocence and said he had no association with the militia . Renzaho 's lawyer blamed the case on political interference by the Rwandan government . Renzaho has the right to appeal the verdict . The decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal . Emmanuel Rukundo , a former military chaplain , was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison . The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen , and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians . Callixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide . The court found that Kalimanzira , a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry , participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them . Prosecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis , including pregnant women and their babies .",Who was governor of Kigali in 1994 ?,Tharcisse Renzaho
106,"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Art Linkletter , the easygoing , smooth-voiced emcee famed for his long-running hosting gigs of the radio and television shows '' House Party '' and `` People Are Funny , '' and author of `` Kids Say the Darndest Things , '' has died , according to his spokeswoman . Linkletter `` died peacefully at home with his family on Wednesday , '' a statement from the family said . He was 97 . `` Just one month earlier , while being honored at an event , he was asked what he considered his greatest life accomplishment , '' the statement said . `` He responded ` Family . ' '' Linkletter rose to fame as a radio announcer in San Diego , later becoming a program director . In 1944 , he launched `` Art Linkletter 's House Party , '' a daytime CBS radio show that moved to television in 1952 and ran until 1969 . `` Kids say the darndest things , '' was Linkletter 's often-repeated phrase because of his humorous interviews with children . It became the title of his best-selling book , a country music hit and was reprised by Bill Cosby as a 1998 TV show . The phrase began as a segment on `` House Party . '' Linkletter would ask several children their thoughts on various topics ; their responses were often hilariously absurd . `` I was Oprah before there was Oprah , '' he once told The Wall Street Journal . Flowers were placed on Linkletter 's star on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame Wednesday afternoon . His nighttime show , `` People Are Funny , '' started on radio in 1942 and ran on NBC television from 1954 to 1961 . According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh 's `` The Complete Directory to Primetime Network and Cable Shows , 1946-Present , '' the show featured everyday guests who would be interviewed by Linkletter and then asked to do a stunt . The result for those who failed at the stunt was often a pie in the face or being splashed by water . Linkletter also hosted a short-lived quiz show , `` The Art Linkletter Show , '' in 1963 . At its height , Linkletter 's fame was notable enough to make him part of Milton Bradley 's `` Game of Life , '' which featured Linkletter 's endorsement and his photo on the game 's $ 100,000 bill . His 1960 biography was called `` Confessions of a Happy Man . '' But the host 's own life was touched by a famous tragedy . In 1969 , his daughter Diane -- just 20 at the time -- jumped to her death from a sixth-floor apartment in Hollywood . Linkletter blamed the death on LSD , though the drug use was never confirmed . Linkletter became an ardent anti-drug crusader , releasing a hit record , `` We Love You , Call Collect , '' which won a Grammy Award . Of his five children , two others also predeceased Linkletter : son Robert died in a 1980 auto accident , and another son , Jack , died of lymphoma in 2007 . Linkletter is survived by his wife of 75 years , Lois , and two daughters , Dawn Griffin and Sharon Linkletter . Linkletter was born Gordon Arthur Kelly in Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan , on July 17 , 1912 . Orphaned as an infant , he was adopted by traveling evangelist John Linkletter and his wife , Mary . After a short stint on Wall Street -- he was a typist at an investment bank at the time of the 1929 Crash , he told the WSJ -- he eventually moved to San Diego and attended college at San Diego State University .

107,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The average cost of medical care for a premature or low birth-weight baby for its first year of life is about $ 49,000 , according to a new report from the March of Dimes Foundation . Babies born after the 37th week of pregnancy are less costly to the health care system than premature babies . By contrast , a newborn without complications costs $ 4,551 for care in its first year of life , the report said . Newborns with other kinds of complications , such as congenital defects , have medical expenses of $ 10,273 on average in the first year . The foundation wants to show employers the importance of good maternity care , maternity coverage , and prevention of prematurity , said Jennifer Howse , president of the March of Dimes , a nonprofit for pregnancy and baby health . `` It 's in the best interest of the bottom line for the employer , and of course it 's certainly in the best interest for the baby , the employee , and ultimately the community in which the business is located , '' she said . Although most of these costs go straight to the health care plans , even out-of-pocket expenses are far greater for premature babies than for children delivered at a normal time . The average out-of-pocket expense for a premature or low-birth-weight baby in the first year was $ 1,987 . For uncomplicated births , it is $ 654 , and a baby with other kinds of complications averages $ 953 in out of pocket expenses . But it 's important to note that these are average costs for premature babies born at different times -- a baby born closer to 40 weeks will most likely cost much less than a baby born at 26 weeks , said William Sexson , neonatologist at Emory University and prematurity prevention chair for the March of Dimes for the state of Georgia . Sexson was not involved in the new report . The problem of prematurity By definition , a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy . About 12 percent of all pregnancies in the United States result in premature birth , according to the National Institutes of Health . A low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 2,500 grams , or 5.5 pounds . Prematurity may contribute to problems such as cerebral palsy , vision problems , learning disabilities , and developmental delays , experts say . The rate of premature babies in the United States has increased 36 percent since the early 1980s , the March of Dimes said . One reason for the abundance of premature births may be the increasing number of elective early deliveries , said Sexson . There is a lack of transparency about both patients ' and obstetricians ' decisions to , for example , have a Caesarean section close to term -- technically premature . The March of Dimes recommends every elective delivery before 39 weeks be reviewed . `` There is a real concern that many of those deliveries are a lot more elective than they ought to be , '' Sexson said . Uncomplicated Caesarean deliveries cost over 40 percent more than uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , the new report said . These deliveries also resulted in longer inpatient stays , outpatient visits , and more prescriptions filled . Most of the costs get covered by a health plan -- out-of-pocket expenses were similar for normal Caesarian deliveries , uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , and complicated births . Preventing premature births Prenatal care is essential in helping mothers carry their babies to term , experts say . The vitamin folate is especially important for mothers-to-be because it has been shown to prevent congenital abnormalities , said Janet Larson , chief of neonatology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Premature babies cost the United States at least $ 26 billion each year , according to the Institute of Medicine . Women who have a shortened cervix , or have certain infections , such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis , are at higher risk for having a premature baby , according to the NIH . A history of giving birth to premature babies is also a risk factor , said Dr. Charles Macri , obstetrician-gynecologist at the The George Washington University Hospital in Washington . A woman in this situation may take progesterone therapy between weeks 16 and 36 to decrease the likelihood of a premature delivery . A pregnant woman should always tell her doctor if she has had any kind of cervical surgery , which may also contribute to premature births , he said . Women who carry multiples babies at once , even twins , are also at higher risk of giving birth prematurely , he said . Not all premature births can be prevented , however . Some babies are `` destined to be born early , '' Macri said . About 50 percent of pregnancies that result in premature births are completely normal until labor , Sexson said . Costs for premature and low-birth-weight babies are also higher in terms of combined medical costs for the mother and child -- $ 64,713 , compared with $ 15,047 for uncomplicated births , the March of Dimes report said . Even in tough economic times , experts agree that pregnant women should not cut back on health care . `` Investing in health care costs -- that 's the best investment a family can make , '' Howse said .",When is a premature baby born ?,before the 37th week of pregnancy
108,"MYRTLE BEACH , South Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The top three Democratic presidential candidates face off in a Monday night debate in South Carolina , with the hearts and minds of African-American voters on the line . Sen. Barack Obama addresses Ebenezer Baptist Church , where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached . Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina share the stage at Myrtle Beach 's Palace Theatre as the nation honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a federal holiday . The debate , put together by CNN and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute , comes five days before the Democratic primary in South Carolina , where almost half of the Democratic primary voters are African-Americans . These voters will be crucial to the outcome of Saturday 's primary in South Carolina . They now appear to be leaning heavily toward Obama , who if elected , would become the country 's first black president . Having a debate on Martin Luther King Jr. . Day in South Carolina `` is very fitting , '' said David Bohrman , CNN senior vice president and Washington bureau chief , who is executive producer of the debate . `` Perhaps a debate on Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina should be made a must-stop on the road to the White House every four years . '' A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered Democrats were backing Obama as the presidential nominee , with 31 percent supporting Clinton . That 's a major shift from October , when African-Americans backed Clinton over Obama , 57 percent to 33 percent . What appears to have changed is Obama 's electability . `` There 's been a huge shift among African-American Democrats from Clinton to Obama . African-American Democrats used to be reluctant to support Obama because they did n't think a black man could be elected . Then Obama won Iowa and nearly won New Hampshire . Now they believe , '' Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst , said . `` Obama 's lead over Clinton among black men is more than 50 points , and among black women , once a Clinton stronghold , Obama has an 11-point advantage , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . Entrance polls from Saturday 's Nevada Democratic caucuses match what appears in the CNN poll . Eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing Obama , with 14 percent supporting Clinton , who if elected , would become the country 's first woman to win the presidency . These kinds of numbers could spell trouble in South Carolina for Clinton , who 's coming off victories in the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses . But Clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community , thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former President Clinton with African-Americans . Both Democratic front-runners were reaching out to African-American voters Sunday . Obama , who often refers to King in his speeches , spoke at Atlanta , Georgia 's Ebenezer Baptist Church , where the late civil rights leader once preached . Watch Clinton , Obama reach out to black voters '' Obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against African-Americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community . `` And yet , if we are honest with ourselves , we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean . If we 're honest with ourselves , we 'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to King 's vision of a beloved community , '' Obama said , citing homophobia , anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment . Obama told the congregation Sunday morning that if King could forgive his jailers , `` surely we can look past what divides us in our time . '' Obama 's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement Sunday by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , which cited his `` appeal across many of the lines that have divided America , '' adding that `` both Clinton and Obama would make very good presidents , -LSB- but -RSB- Obama is the person ; this is his time . '' Georgia voters head to the polls February 5 . In New York , Hillary Clinton spent Sunday morning at another historic black church , Harlem 's Abyssinian Baptist Church , where she picked up the endorsement of its pastor , the Rev. Calvin Butts . Butts said outside the church : `` A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this community and this country that she has the experience to make things happen , and the vision to return us to a place of prosperity . '' Clinton also sounded a conciliatory note Sunday . `` I have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague Sen. Barack Obama . I am honored to be running with him , '' she said . `` I hope that this election remains focused on the big challenges that confront us . '' After a distant third-place finish in the Nevada caucuses , Edwards on Sunday made light of his performance . On CNN 's `` Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer , '' Edwards said he hopes `` what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas , '' admitting , `` I got my butt kicked . '' Edwards would like to rebound in South Carolina , his native state . He won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the White House . But he 's running a distant third in most recent surveys in South Carolina , behind Obama and Clinton . On Sunday , Edwards sounded a cautious note , saying South Carolina was important but just one `` part of the long process . ... We will see how it goes . '' Also on `` Late Edition , '' the House majority whip , Rep. James Clyburn , D-South Carolina , cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks . Clyburn , the highest ranking African-American in Congress , was instrumental in having Monday 's debate held in South Carolina . `` When we were dealing with the dates of the primary , we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world , for that matter , to have this debate on Martin Luther King Jr. 's birthday celebration , '' Clyburn told Blitzer , who is the moderator of the event .

109,"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens , dignitaries and politicians . South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday . The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament , with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers . The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim , who died Tuesday of a heart failure . Kim 's age at the time of his death was in dispute , with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83 . Kim 's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said . Another president , Park Chung-hee , was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979 . Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea . The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953 . But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor , Roh Moo-hyun . Ahead of the funeral , President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation , who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries . Lee , in turn , reiterated his government 's firm stance , presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan was quoted as saying by Yonhap . But in a possible sign that icy relations between the two rival nations are nevertheless thawing , South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday . It was the first high-level , cross-border contact in nearly two years . The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year . Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan . The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters . South Korea condemned the action , calling the launches `` provocative '' and `` unwise .

110,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The new district attorney of Boulder County , Colorado , said he plans to take a fresh look at the investigation into the 1996 slaying of JonBenet Ramsey . The DA 's office assumed responsibility for the investigation in 2002 . But District Attorney Stan Garnett told CNN that he wants to decide during his first 30 days in office whether the case should be returned to Boulder police . `` I 'm trying to determine whether it 's efficient to have the ongoing investigation handled by my office or somebody else , '' said Garnett , who was sworn in as district attorney January 13 . The DA 's office is relatively small , he said , with 27 lawyers and six investigators handling between 2,000 and 2,500 felony cases a year . Although the Ramsey case has not generated news since last year , tips and information regularly come in to authorities . Whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing , Garnett said . He said reports that he is considering reopening the case are inaccurate . `` It 's not closed . It has n't been solved , and it 's been open the whole time . '' The case is one of the nation 's most famous unsolved murders . On December 26 , 1996 , John Ramsey discovered the body of his 6-year-old daughter , JonBenet , in the basement of the family 's Boulder home . The girl had been strangled and beaten . A ransom note was found on the stairs of the home , demanding $ 118,000 . Early in the case , Boulder police said JonBenet 's parents , John and Patsy Ramsey , were under `` an umbrella of suspicion '' in her death . But they were never formally named as suspects , and a grand jury refused to indict them . Patsy Ramsey died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer . In July , Garnett 's predecessor , Mary Lacy , issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the Ramsey family after a DNA test performed using new technology showed that DNA found on JonBenet 's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man . The test results , Lacy said , were `` powerful evidence '' that allows investigators to think the Ramsey family were victims , not suspects . That same third-party DNA exonerated John Mark Karr , a one-time teacher , after he was arrested in Thailand and brought to Colorado . Authorities said Karr told a University of Colorado professor in e-mails that he was involved in JonBenet 's death . He told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died , although he called her death an accident and said he loved her . Lacy was widely criticized , including by then-Gov . Bill Owens , for the handling of Karr 's arrest . Boulder police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation . But , Garnett said Friday , `` I 've been very impressed by the Boulder P.D. . They are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well . ... They 've done a very nice job . '' The department has 24 investigators , four times as many as the DA 's staff , he said . Garnett was elected DA in November to replace Lacy , who could not run again because of term limits . Before he was elected , he served as a trial lawyer for 22 years , according to the DA 's Web site .",Where was the Ramsey case ?,"Boulder County , Colorado"

Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , requested that the VA look into potential contamination at its facilities . This comes after more than 10,000 veterans were possibly exposed to HIV and hepatitis at three VA facilities while undergoing colonoscopies and other procedures with equipment that had not been properly cleaned . The VA sent letters to those veterans offering free testing for hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV . `` The VA prides itself on being accountable , and we are extremely concerned about this matter , and as a result we have initiated an investigation , '' Dr. Michael J.

Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , and Leymah Gbowee , a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country , will share the prize with Tawakkul Karman , an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in Yemen . The three , chosen `` for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights to full participation in peace-building work , '' will be honored in Oslo , Norway , during a program of events that culminates on Sunday in a star-studded concert .

Acts performing at the concert include David Gray , Jill Scott , rock band Evanescence and country duo Sugarland . Johnson Sirleaf , a 73-year-old Harvard graduate whose political resilience has earned her the nickname `` Iron Lady , '' became Africa 's first democratically-elected female president in 2006 , three years after decades of civil war ended . Crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former President Charles Taylor , she declared a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary-age children . Gbowee , 39 , led a women 's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in Liberia 's civil war . She mobilized hundreds of women to force delegates at 2003 peace talks to sign a treaty - at one point calling for a `` sex strike '' until demands were met .

116,"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq 's oil minister Monday opened international bidding on six oil fields that could increase the country 's oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day . Iraqi flags flutter during the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in the Shiite holy city of Najaf . But the oil ministry continues to negotiate short-term no-bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies , including Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell , Total SA , Chevron Corp. , and BP -- a step recently criticized by two U.S. lawmakers . Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani announced Monday that 35 international oil companies can bid on long-term contracts for redeveloping the six oil fields , as well as two natural gas fields . `` It is a unique event and a significant feature in the new Iraq that we declare the first bidding course for developing the Iraq oil fields publicly and fully in a transparent way , '' the minister said at Monday 's news conference . It marks the first time in more than 35 years that Iraq has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders . Shahrastani said the fee-based contracts will not give the winning companies a share in the revenue from oil sales `` because this wealth belong to Iraq only and thus we will not allow anyone to share the Iraqis ' oil . '' Iraq has among the largest oil reserves in the world , with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for the No. 2 status behind Saudi Arabia 's 264 billion barrels , according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration . Iraq 's current oil production is 2.25 million barrels a day , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . That is close to its status before the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 , but below its levels prior to the first Persian Gulf War in 1991 . The six oil fields that will be open to development are in the Kirkuk oil fields and the neighboring Bai Hassan fields in northern Iraq , Shahrastani said . They are al-Rumeila , al-Zubair , al-Qurna West , and three fields in the Maysan oil fields -- Bazirqan , Abu Gharab and Fakah . The two gas fields are Akas and Mansouriya gas fields in western Iraq . The fields have already been explored and are producing oil and gas , but the equipment is old and outdated , Shahrastani said . He hopes that the new infrastructure provided by the international oil companies will mean `` the production can be increased in less cost and less time . '' Iraq 's oil minister said the ministry will invite the 35 qualified international companies -- which includes BP , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron -- to prepare their bids over the next two weeks . The contracts could go into effect by next year , but Shahrastani said it will take several more years before oil production is increased . `` We hope in 2013 through this first bidding course to increase production in these fields by 1.5 million barrels per day , in addition to our daily average production rate during the last five years , '' he said . Meanwhile , Iraq hopes to wrap up its talks regarding short-term , no-bid contracts that would allow the U.S. and European oil companies -- including Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Total SA , Chevron , and BP -- to service those oil fields as soon as possible . Last week , Sen. Charles Schumer , D-New York , and Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing concerns about the no-bid contracts that the government of Iraq is negotiating with the U.S. and European companies . The senators , who released the letter , said they are worried that unfair distribution of oil revenue could inflame the violence between the warring religious and political groups of Iraq . `` We urge you to persuade the -LRB- government of Iraq -RRB- to refrain from signing contracts with multinational oil companies until a hydrocarbon law is in effect in Iraq , '' read the letter from Schumer and Kerry . `` At this time , the -LRB- government of Iraq -RRB- currently does not have in place a revenue-sharing law that could fairly allocate any revenue gained from Iraq 's lucrative hydrocarbon fields between the three major ethnic groups in Iraq , '' read the letter . `` We fear that any such agreements signed by Iraq 's Hydrocarbon Ministry without an equitable revenue-sharing agreement in place would simply add more fuel to Iraq 's civil war . '' In their letter , the senators said that Iraq 's oil revenue during 2007 and 2008 will total $ 100 billion , `` most of which will not be spent on reconstruction due to bureaucratic incompetence . '' The oil ministry said Monday that the negotiations over the no-bid `` technical support agreements '' are ongoing . Under those short-term agreements the companies would be paid a fee for extracting the oil , but would not get a share of the revenue from oil sales . The companies that will be allowed to compete in the open bidding for long-term contracts , which would be under a similar revenue format , are :",New contracts would raise Iraq 's production by how much ?,1.5 million barrels per day
117,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were created to help individuals realize the American dream of home ownership , but they now find their survival at risk in the U.S. mortgage crisis . Steps to shore up FannieMae and Freddie Mac could eventually stabilize home prices . Friday 's closure of California-based IndyMac bank by federal regulators on Friday sparked investor panic that sent shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a wild ride and fueled speculation of a government rescue . On Sunday , the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps to make funds available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if necessary . IndyMac , which reopened Monday under federal supervision , was once one of the nation 's largest home lenders . Thanks in part to the nation 's mortgage crisis , it lost hundreds of millions of dollars this year and last , and concerns about the bank led customers to withdraw $ 1.3 billion in the last two weeks , prompting the government takeover . Below , CNN 's Ali Velshi and Gerri Willis answer questions about Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and IndyMac and how you may be affected . Q : What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and what do they do ? A : Originally chartered by Congress , both were converted into private companies with shares traded on Wall Street . Neither company directly loans money to prospective home buyers . Instead , they buy mortgages from banks and other lenders on the secondary market , thus freeing up more funds to home lenders . They resell bundled loans as mortgage-backed securities . Read more about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac '' Combined , the two companies own or guarantee almost half of the home loans in the United States , or $ 5.3 trillion of mortgage debt . Q : How did they get their names ? A : Fannie Mae was created in 1938 , during the Great Depression . The nickname comes from the acronym FNMA , which stands for Federal National Mortgage Association . Freddie Mac was chartered by Congress as a private corporation in 1970 to end Fannie Mae 's monopoly over the secondary mortgage market . The name Freddie Mac spawns from the acronym FHLMC , or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. . Q : What 's the connection between the IndyMac takeover and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ? A : Nothing , except both crises stem from the same problem : a drop in home prices and the inability of mortgage-holders to make their payments , thereby leaving banks -LRB- whether it was IndyMac , an actual lender , or Fannie/Freddie , the secondary banks that had bought mortgages -RRB- holding the bag . Q : Will the government 's actions change the value of my home ? A : Steps the federal government is taking to shore up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is ultimately a positive for the housing industry . Although it wo n't happen overnight , housing prices could be stabilized by the move . The reason ? These two institutions are critical to the smooth functioning of the mortgage underwriting industry . Q : Is my money safe in the bank ? A : Up to certain limits , money is safe in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. . The FDIC guarantees traditional bank accounts up to $ 100,000 and individual retirement accounts up to $ 250,000 . Money beyond those limits is n't guaranteed if a bank fails . In the case of IndyMac , the FDIC says it will cover 50 percent of uninsured balances there . But as a practical matter , consumers should n't count on that . Bottom line : Owning accounts with amounts that exceed the FDIC limits is like driving without a seat belt . Watch : Is your bank safe ? '' Q : How are the government 's moves to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac going to affect mortgages , loans and the federal budget deficit ? A : Shoring up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is good news for consumer lending lending generally because it boosts confidence in the mortgage markets . If you already have a loan , it 's wo n't have immediate consequences . We do n't yet know if it will be successful and how much the two entities might take advantage of the federal governments offer to lend them money . For that reason , it 's difficult to say what the impact might be on the federal budget deficit . Suffice it to say , however , that the buck always seems to stop with the American taxpayer .",What are two American `` mortgage giants '' ?,Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
118,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United Nations court convicted a former governor of Rwanda to life in prison for his role in a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country . An estimated 800,000 people -- mainly Tutsis -- were killed in Rwanda in 1994 . Tharcisse Renzaho was found guilty of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . The verdict , delivered Tuesday , is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda -LRB- ICTR -RRB- . The U.N. court is holding hearings in Arusha , Tanzania , where it is based . Renzaho was governor of the capital , Kigali , and a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994 during the country 's genocide , when extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda . It began in April of that year and within 100 days , an estimated 800,000 people were killed . The court found that Renzaho ordered soldiers , police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify Tutsi civilians to be executed . It found he ordered the distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis . Renzaho also supervised a selection process at a refugee site where about 40 Tutsis were abducted and killed , the court found . Renzaho participated in an attack at the Sainte Famille church in which more than 100 Tutsis were killed . People across Rwanda sought refuge in churches all over the country as the genocide unfolded . He also made remarks encouraging the sexual abuse of women , according to the court , and was found criminally liable for the rapes that followed . The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre . Renzaho was arrested in September 2002 in the Democratic Republic of Congo . His trial began in January 2007 and closed in September that year after hearing from 53 witnesses , including Renzaho . Throughout the trial , Renzaho maintained his innocence and said he had no association with the militia . Renzaho 's lawyer blamed the case on political interference by the Rwandan government . Renzaho has the right to appeal the verdict . The decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal . Emmanuel Rukundo , a former military chaplain , was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison . The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen , and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians . Callixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide . The court found that Kalimanzira , a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry , participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them . Prosecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis , including pregnant women and their babies .",What is Renzaho guilty of ?,"genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes"
119,"Researchers may be getting closer to an effective way of preventing age-related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision loss among older Americans . A new study found that vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid may help prevent age-related macular degeneration . A new study finds that women who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had lower risks of developing age-related macular degeneration . The women who got the supplements , compared with those taking a placebo , had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD , and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD . Epidemiologist and study author William G. Christen , Sc.D. , of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School , expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies , `` the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age-related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking . '' Christen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older , there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men . Christen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD . The 5,442 women who participated in the randomized , double-blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease . The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study , which lasted more than 7 years . Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system , and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors . Age-related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60 , involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula , the central part of the retina . The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly , as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision . `` If you affect that central part of your vision , no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life , '' explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld , ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology . There are two types of macular degeneration : wet and dry . Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula , which can rupture and bleed . The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function . While some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease -LRB- including laser surgery , photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye -RRB- , there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form . When asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid , retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet . `` If you do anything , I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A , E , C and zinc , '' suggests Frank , who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry . These antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age-related macular degeneration in the 10-year Age-Related Eye Disease Study conducted by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health . However , Frank does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the B vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early AMD from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years , after a large-scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin .",What kind of vitamins can potentially ward off age-related macular degeneration ?,"B6 , B12 and folic acid"
120,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The confirmation of Michael Mukasey as attorney general was all but assured Friday when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Charles Schumer of New York announced they would support the retired federal judge from New York just hours after the chairman of the Judiciary Committee announced his opposition to the nominee . Feinstein and Schumer are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is scheduled to vote on the Mukasey nomination Tuesday . If all the Republican members of the committee also vote for Mukasey , which is expected , his nomination will go before the full Senate . A leading Democrat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said Wednesday Mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the Judiciary Committee . Schumer had praised the nomination of Mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced Mukasey as his choice to replace former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales . Gonzales gave up the post in September . `` This is an extremely difficult decision , '' Schumer said . `` When an administration so political , so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge , we are never left with an ideal choice . Judge Mukasey is not my ideal choice . However , Judge Mukasey , whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him , is far better than anyone could expect from this administration . '' A number of Democratic senators , however , have said they will oppose Mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . Waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning . Mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture . While saying `` serious questions have been raised about Judge Mukasey 's views on torture and on separation of powers , '' Feinstein said she would support the nominee because the Justice Department needed fresh leadership . `` First and foremost , Michael Mukasey is not Alberto Gonzales . Rather , he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the Southern District of New York . `` I believe that Judge Mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments , allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by Congress . '' Just hours before Feinstein and Schumer announced their decisions , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , announced he would vote against the Mukasey nomination . Watch Sen. Leahy explain why he ca n't support the Mukasey nomination '' `` No American should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture , '' Leahy said . `` Waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the Spanish Inquisition . We prosecuted Japanese war criminals for waterboarding after World War II . `` I am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice . I like Michael Mukasey . I wish that I could support his nomination . But I can not . America needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one , not even the president , is above the law . '' President Bush demanded the Senate confirm Mukasey during a speech Thursday at the Heritage Foundation , an influential conservative think tank . `` In a time of war , it 's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place , '' the president said . The president has equated asking Mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the CIA-run interrogation program , whose details are classified . Bush said the program does not violate U.S. bans on torture , but added that Mukasey `` does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy . '' But Leahy said `` Judge Mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret ` facts and circumstances . ' '' `` He was asked whether waterboarding is illegal . Our law makes torture illegal , and waterboarding is torture , and it is illegal . It is frankly not dependent on any , quote , ` relevant facts and circumstances of the technique 's past or proposed use , ' '' he said , quoting from Mukasey 's response to senators on the question . Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding . But those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al Qaeda 's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . The practice was used by the Spanish Inquisition , Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge and the World War II Japanese military , according to Human Rights Watch . It is specifically banned in U.S. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the U.S. military .

Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found to have been involved in `` spot-fixing '' -- a practice involving illegal gambling during matches . Butt , 26 , was banned for 10 years with half of that suspended on certain conditions while Asif , 28 , received a seven-year ban with 24 months suspended . Amir , 18 , was given a straight five-year penalty for his involvement in incidents during the Test series against England in August 2010 . They have 21 days to appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport . The International Cricket Council announced the punishments following an independent tribunal 's hearing in Qatar . It came a day after Britain 's Crown Prosecution Service charged the trio and their agent Mazhar Majeed with conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments , and conspiracy to cheat . Amir and Asif were accused of deliberately bowling no-balls -- deliveries which incur a scoring penalty and can not dismiss batsmen -- to the instructions of Majeed , who received money from a third party , while Butt was said to be aware of the arrangement . The conditions of the reduced sentences require Butt and Asif to refrain from further breaches of the anti-corruption code and to participate in an education program run by the Pakistan Cricket Board .

128,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner , most Americans remain confident the Obama administration can protect the country from terrorism , according to a new national poll . A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday also indicates the vast majority of Americans believe that full-body scanners should be used in airports across the country . Nearly two-thirds of people questioned in the poll said they have a moderate or great deal of confidence in the administration to protect the public from future terrorist attacks , up 2 percentage points from August . Thirty-five percent said they have not much or no confidence , down 1 percentage point from August . Read the full poll results -LRB- PDF -RRB- A number of Republicans have criticized President Obama over his handling of the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan . But according to the survey , 57 percent approve of the way Obama has responded , while 39 percent disapprove of how he handled the situation . `` Only a third of Republicans have a positive view of Obama on this matter , but the key for the administration is the 55 percent of independents who approve of how the president responded to the incident on Christmas Day , '' said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director . The poll also indicates no increase in overall concern about terrorism . `` In October , about a third said they were worried that a family member would become a victim of terrorism , and that number is unchanged in the wake of the attempted attack in December , '' Holland said . `` The public seems to react calmly to individual incidents , possibly because most Americans believe that the government can not prevent every single terrorist plot from occurring . '' Six in 10 said terrorists always will find a way to launch an attack , no matter what the government does , he added -- identical to the number who felt that way during the Bush administration . The poll indicates a majority , 57 percent , think suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab should be tried in military court and not a civilian criminal court . Forty-two percent back handling the case in civilian court . According to the survey , Americans also are split on whether heads should roll as a result of the attempted bombing of the airliner . Forty-six percent questioned feel that top officials in the federal agencies responsible for handling the issue of terrorism should be fired , while 51 percent said no . The poll indicates that nearly eight in 10 believe full-body scanners should be used in U.S. airports , while 15 percent said they would refuse to go through one of the machines if asked to do so . `` Most Americans do n't see full-body scanners as a health risk , and more than seven in 10 say they would be unconcerned if asked to go through one at an airport , '' Holland said . `` Women in particular seem to prefer the idea of a full-body scanner to being frisked by a security guard , even when the question makes clear that the guard doing the manual pat-down would also be a woman .

139,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bea Arthur , the actress best known for her roles as television 's `` Maude '' and the sardonic Dorothy on '' The Golden Girls , '' has died of cancer , a family spokesman said Saturday . Bea Arthur , right , with `` Golden Girls '' co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008 . She was 86 . Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles , her family by her side . She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet , he said . No funeral services are currently planned , Watt said , adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers . Arthur 's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear 's `` All in the Family '' as Edith Bunker 's cousin , and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series . In the '70s , `` Maude '' was ahead of the social curve , tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography , race relations and , in an episode titled `` Maude 's Dilemma , '' abortion . That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter -LRB- Bill Macy -RRB- decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child . But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women 's liberation -- a big deal for the shy , Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City . During the Depression , Arthur 's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge , Maryland . By the time she was 12 , Arthur was nearly 5 feet , 10 inches tall , and self-conscious about her height . But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting . Along the way , she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about , but she kept the last name -- Arthur . The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway . Critics delighted in her haughty , serpent-tongued deliveries . Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called `` Once Upon a Tune , '' but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on `` Studio One , '' `` Kraft Television Theatre '' and `` The Sid Caesar Show . '' Arthur drew attention in `` Threepenny Opera '' on Broadway with Lotte Lenya , but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in `` Fiddler on the Roof . '' In 1966 , Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play `` Mame , '' playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role . Eight years later , she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball , but by then she was already well-established as Maude . Arthur left `` Maude '' in 1978 , making television and some film appearances afterward . She starred in a short-lived series , `` Amanda 's , '' in 1983 and then joined the cast of `` The Golden Girls '' in 1985 with Betty White , Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty . Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida . -LRB- Getty played Arthur 's mother -RRB- . The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for `` Maude . '' Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season . White , McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show , renamed `` The Golden Palace , '' but the show lasted only one season without Arthur . Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992 , returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts . In the early part of this decade , Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows . Her last stage appearance was in 2006 . Her last television appearance was on `` The View '' in 2007 .",Bea Arthur starred in Maude and what other TV show ?,The Golden Girls

Michael Jackson , shown in 2008 , was one of the biggest pop stars in history . He was 50 . He collapsed at his residence in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles , California , about noon Pacific time , suffering cardiac arrest , according to brother Randy Jackson . He died at UCLA Medical Center . Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said an autopsy would probably be done on the singer Friday , with results expected that afternoon . Watch crowds gather at Jackson 's hospital '' `` Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color , '' the Rev. Al Sharpton said . `` To say an ` icon ' would only give these young people in Harlem a fraction of what he was . He was a historic figure that people will measure music and the industry by . '' Jackson 's blazing rise to stardom -- and later fall from grace -- is among the most startling of show business tales . The son of a steelworker , he rose to fame as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , a band he formed with his brothers in the late 1960s . By the late '70s , as a solo artist , he was topping the charts with cuts from `` Off the Wall , '' including `` Rock With You '' and `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . '' Watch Jackson perform at a 1988 concert '' In 1982 , he released `` Thriller , '' an album that eventually produced seven hit singles . An appearance the next year on a Motown Records 25th-anniversary special cemented his status as the biggest star in the country . Timeline : The life of Michael Jackson '' For the rest of the 1980s , they came no bigger . `` Thriller 's '' follow-up , 1987 's `` Bad , '' sold almost as many copies . A new Jackson album -- a new Jackson appearance -- was a pop culture event . iReport : Share your memories of Michael Jackson The pop music landscape was changing , however , opening up for rap , hip-hop and what came to be called `` alternative '' -- and Jackson was seen as out of step . His next release , 1991 's `` Dangerous , '' debuted at No. 1 but `` only '' produced one top-ranking single -- `` Black or White '' -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending , in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch . And then `` Dangerous '' was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana 's `` Nevermind , '' an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics . After that , more attention was paid to Jackson 's private life than his music career , which faltered . A 1995 two-CD greatest hits , `` HIStory , '' sold relatively poorly , given the huge expense of Jackson 's recording contract : about 7 million copies , according to Recording Industry of America certifications . A 2001 album of new material , `` Invincible , '' did even worse . In 2005 , he went to trial on child-molestation charges . He was acquitted . In July 2008 , after three years away from the spotlight , Jackson announced a series of concerts at London 's O2 Arena as his `` curtain call . '' Some of the shows , initially scheduled to begin in July , were eventually postponed until 2010 . Watch the reaction to Jackson 's passing Rise to stardom Michael Jackson was born August 29 , 1958 , to Joe Jackson , a Gary , Indiana , steelworker , and his wife , Katherine . By the time he was 6 , he had joined his brothers in a musical group organized by his father , and by the time he was 10 , the group -- the Jackson 5 -- had been signed to Motown . Watch Michael Jackson 's life in video He made his first television appearance at age 11 . Jackson , a natural performer , soon became the group 's front man . Music critic Langdon Winner , reviewing the group 's first album , `` Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 , '' for Rolling Stone , praised Michael 's versatile singing and added , `` Who is this ` Diana Ross , ' anyway ? '' The group 's first four singles -- `` I Want You Back , '' `` ABC , '' `` The Love You Save '' and `` I 'll Be There '' -- went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart , the first time any group had pulled off that feat . There was even a Jackson 5 cartoon series on ABC . Watch reaction from Motown Studios '' In 1972 , he hit No. 1 as a solo artist with the song `` Ben . '' The group 's popularity waned as the '70s continued , and Michael eventually went solo full time . He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 movie version of `` The Wiz , '' and released the album `` Off the Wall '' in 1979 . Its success paved the way for `` Thriller , '' which eventually became the best-selling album in history , with 50 million copies sold worldwide . At that point , Michael Jackson became ubiquitous . Seven of `` Thriller 's '' nine cuts were released as singles ; all made the Top Ten . The then-new cable channel MTV , criticized for its almost exclusively white playlist , finally started playing Jackson 's videos . They aired incessantly , including a 14-minute minimovie of the title cut . -LRB- `` Weird Al '' Yankovic cemented his own stardom by lampooning Jackson 's song `` Beat It '' with a letter-perfect parody video . -RRB- On the Motown Records ' 25th-anniversary special -- a May 1983 TV extravaganza with notable turns by the Temptations , the Four Tops and Smokey Robinson -- it was Michael Jackson who stopped the show . Already he was the most popular musician in America , riding high with `` Thriller . '' But something about his electrifying performance of `` Billie Jean , '' complete with the patented backward dance moves , boosted his stardom to a new level . Watch Jackson perform `` Thiller '' '' People copied his Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved , zippered-jacket look . Showbiz veterans such as Fred Astaire praised his chops . He posed for photos with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the White House . Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets , two of which -- `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Say Say Say '' -- became top five hits . Jackson became a Pepsi spokesman , and when his hair caught fire while making a commercial , it was worldwide news . It all happened very fast -- within a couple years of the Motown special . But even at the time of the `` Motown 25 '' moonwalk , fame was old hat to Michael Jackson . He had n't even turned 25 himself , but he 'd been a star for more than half his life . He was given the nickname the `` King of Pop '' -- a spin on Elvis Presley 's status as `` the King of Rock 'n' Roll '' -- and few questioned the moniker . Relentless attention But , as the showbiz saying has it , when you 're on top of the world , there 's nowhere to go but down . The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real , some rumored -- as his music . As the Web site Allmusic.com notes , he was rumored to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber and to have purchased the bones of John Merrick , the `` Elephant Man . '' -LRB- Neither was true . -RRB- He did have a pet chimpanzee , Bubbles ; underwent a series of increasingly drastic plastic surgeries ; established an estate , Neverland , filled with zoo animals and amusement park rides ; and managed to purchase the Beatles catalog from under Paul McCartney 's nose , which displeased the ex-Beatle immensely . In 1990s and 2000s , Jackson found himself pasted across the media for his short-lived marriages , the first to Elvis Presley 's daughter , Lisa Marie ; his 2002 claim that then Sony Records head Tommy Mottola was racist ; his behavior and statements during a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir done for a documentary called `` Living With Michael Jackson ; '' his changing physical appearance ; and , above all , the accusations that he sexually molested young boys at Neverland . Watch report on legacy on Michael Jackson '' The first such accusation , in 1993 , resulted in a settlement to the 13-year-old accuser -LRB- rumored to be as high as $ 20 million -RRB- , though no criminal charges were filed , Allmusic.com notes . He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets . Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block . However , an auction of material from Neverland , scheduled for April , was called off and all items returned to Jackson . Interest in Jackson never faded , however , even if some of it was prurient . In 2008 , when he announced 10 comeback shows in London , beginning in July 2009 , the story made worldwide news . The number of concerts was later increased to 50 . Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March . However , when the shows were postponed until 2010 , rumors swept the Internet that Jackson was not physically prepared and possibly suffering from skin cancer . Watch discussion of his tough life , brilliant career '' At the time , the president and CEO of AEG Live , Randy Phillips , said , `` He 's as healthy as can be -- no health problems whatsoever .

167,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the finest directors of his generation , winning an Oscar for `` The Pianist '' and nominations for `` Tess '' and `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but he is probably as equally well known for his own tumultuous life . Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate are pictured together in London in the 1960s . Polanski , who was arrested Saturday in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a decades-old sex charge , had lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States . The 76-year-old declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for `` The Pianist '' in 2003 . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a tribute to him , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . Polanski was put in `` provisional detention '' and now faces the possibility of being extradited to the U.S. , where a warrant for his arrest was issued in 1978 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl , but fled the U.S. before he could be sentenced . Polanski was accused of plying the girl , then known as Samantha Gailey , with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . Watch as filmmakers rally round Polanski '' She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski was born in Paris in 1933 of Polish-Jewish parents . Aged three , he and his family returned to Krakow in his father 's native Poland . After the Nazis invaded his parents were sent to concentration camps : his mother was gassed at Auschwitz although his father survived the war . The young Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto and `` soared out of Poland on sheer personality , '' according to director Marina Zenovich , whose 2007 documentary `` Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired , '' paints a sympathetic picture of the exiled movie legend . Growing up in war-torn Poland , the young Polanski found comfort in the cinema and in acting in radio dramas , on stage and in films . In 1962 , Polanski directed his first feature-length film , `` Knife in the Water . '' Poorly received in Poland it was a sensation in the West , and won an Academy Award nomination as Best Foreign Film . See images of Polanski 's life on cellulloid '' He later moved to England , co-starring with American actress Sharon Tate , whom he married in 1968 , in the Hammer horror parody , `` Dance of the Vampires/The Fearless Vampire Killers , or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are in My Neck . '' Following his move to Hollywood , Polanski was at his peak : he was one of the hottest directors thanks to the critical and commercial hit Rosemary 's Baby and he was married to the beautiful Tate . `` At a certain point in his life , Roman Polanski had a lot of hope , '' Zenovich told TIME magazine in 2008 . `` He was living this great life . He was so talented and everyone wanted to work with him . '' But that hopeful period ended when Tate , eight months ' pregnant , was murdered by followers of Charles Manson in 1969 . According to TIME , Polanski spent the first years after her death on a kind of sexual spree , and began spending time with younger and younger women , like 15-year-old Nastassja Kinski . When Polanski was arrested for assaulting Gailey , his case drew the attention of Judge Laurence J. Rittenband , who had earlier presided over Elvis Presley 's divorce , Marlon Brando 's child-custody battle and a paternity suit against Cary Grant . Rittenband , in a manner reminiscent of the one-liner-dropping judge in the Anna Nicole Smith case , was obsessed with the media . He even had a bailiff maintain a scrapbook of his newspaper clippings , according court filings . The case proceeded in a strange manner . Rittenband , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . The judge 's bizarre behavior might have continued had Polanski not fled to France , where he has lived for the last 30 years , ultimately marrying again and having two children . Polanski has continued to make critically acclaimed films , such as `` Tess , '' an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel `` Tess of the d'Urbervilles '' which tells the story of a beautiful country girl -LRB- Nastassja Kinski -RRB- who is seduced by an older man . In 1981 , he returned to Poland to direct and star in a stage production of `` Amadeus . '' And 2002 's `` The Pianist , '' re-established Polanksi as a top-flight director . There have been repeated attempts to settle the sex case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director 's case was handled years ago . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be thrown out . Now married and known as Samantha Geimer , she filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife 's killers died . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . Atkins , 61 , died Thursday . She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer .",Who did Polanski marry ?,Sharon Tate

174,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans . E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals . Known as `` e-cigarettes , '' the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals , spiced with flavors such as chocolate , cola or bubble gum . While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a `` healthy way '' to smoke , federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user . `` The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public , '' said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg , commissioner of the FDA . CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere , one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes , after the FDA announcement , and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment . Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval , the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user . That is why the FDA began to test them . The FDA 's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes . In releasing its information , the FDA did not identify the two companies , but said in one sample , diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected . Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them , the FDA said . The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008 . To date , 50 shipments have been stopped . The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . `` We know very little about these devices , said Dr. Jonathan Samet , director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California , `` but to say they are healthy -- that 's highly doubtful . '' Samet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings . Dr. Jonathan Winickoff , chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium , said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes . `` It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations , or even enforce rules that they not be used , '' he said . `` Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products , '' said Dr. Matthew McKenna , director of the Office of Smoking and Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` It 's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general . '' The FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court . The FDA suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA 's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program either online , by regular mail , fax or phone .

180,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The presidents of Sudan and Chad signed a non-aggression agreement late Thursday , aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two African nations . Chad President Idriss Deby , right , and Sudan 's President Omar al-Beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar , Senegal , between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby , the president of Chad . Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq . Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . The rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad . They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena , the capital of Chad , in early February . As recently as Thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border . Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby 's regime . The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region . Kingsley Amaning , the U.N. 's humanitarian coordinator for Chad , said more than 10,000 people from Darfur , in Sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad . They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there . The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , Kingsley said . Haq said the United Nations , which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region , will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursday 's deal . The countries have signed several peace agreements in the past , only to see renewed violence flare up . E-mail to a friend",who is the president of Chad ?,Idriss Deby
181,"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The 2012 box office got off to a fine start this weekend , as Paramount 's `` found footage '' -LRB- riiiight ... -RRB- horror movie `` The Devil Inside , '' which the studio acquired for just under $ 1 million , earned a tremendous $ 34.5 million in its first three days , becoming the first breakout box office star since `` The Lion King 3D . '' In fact , the strong debut marks the third-best January opening of all time behind `` Cloverfield '' -LRB- $ 40.1 million -RRB- and a re-release of `` Star Wars '' -LRB- $ 35.9 million -RRB- . Is this a sign of things to come in 2012 ? Perhaps . But it 's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies . Demonic tales have made a mini-comeback in the last few years -- starting with the success of 2005 ′ s `` The Exorcism of Emily Rose , '' which earned $ 75.1 million domestically . Since then , similar titles like 2009 ′ s `` The Haunting in Connecticut '' -LRB- $ 55.4 million -RRB- , 2010 ′ s `` The Last Exorcism '' -LRB- $ 41 million -RRB- , and 2011 ′ s `` Insidious '' -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets . `` Insidious , '' for example , cost just $ 1.5 million to make . Of course , the `` Paranormal Activity '' movies -LRB- the fourth of which was just announced this week -RRB- are the biggest success stories of this whole trend . A total of $ 8 million has been spent making the three `` found footage '' movies , yet they have earned $ 296.7 million domestically . Paramount marketed `` The Devil Inside '' in much the same way the studio markets the `` Paranormal '' films . Commercials included ample shots of audiences screaming at the screen , and viewers were encouraged to use social media to chat up the film with the `` Tweet Your Scream '' campaign . Indeed , all the promotional costs -- certainly a much higher number than the budget -- helped `` The Devil Inside '' achieve a stellar debut , but where does it go from here ? Well , it falls . Fast . Due to their overwhelmingly young audiences , who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend , horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office , but `` The Devil Inside , '' with its utterly terrible `` F '' CinemaScore grade -LRB- some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an `` F '' or closer to the `` C '' range -RRB- , will likely plummet even more quickly . Not that it really matters , though -- the horror pic is already in the black , and it may finish with as much as $ 70 million . In second place , `` Mission : Impossible - Ghost Protocol , '' another Paramount film , continued its comeback performance with $ 20.5 million in its fourth weekend . The action blockbuster , which became the biggest hit of the holidays , has now earned $ 170.2 million , and it should finish well above $ 200 million . `` Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows '' held onto third place with a $ 14.1 million weekend . The sequel , which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original `` Sherlock Holmes , '' has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks . After two weekends , `` Shadows '' was trailing `` Sherlock Holmes '' by $ 59.7 million , but over the past two weeks , the sequel has narrowed that gap to $ 22.7 million , and it now has a running total of $ 157.4 million -- still disappointing , but not nearly the disaster it first appeared . `` The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo '' finished the frame in fourth place with $ 11.3 million , dipping only 24 percent , the smallest drop in the Top 10 . Could the edgy adaptation finally be finding its adult audience now that the warm n ' fuzzy holiday season is over ? After 19 days , `` Dragon Tattoo '' has grossed $ 76.8 million , and if it maintains strong holds like this , it should pass $ 100 million . `` Alvin and the Chipmunks : Chipwrecked '' rounds out the Top 5 . The kiddie threequel , which has majorly underperformed compared to expectations , dropped 42 percent to $ 9.5 million . It has now grossed $ 111.6 million total . The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing . Two of them , `` War Horse '' and `` We Bought A Zoo , '' are performing respectably , though . The films earned $ 8.6 and $ 8.5 million , respectively , this weekend , and they have nearly identical totals of $ 56.8 million and $ 56.6 million . Still , there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that `` War Horse '' -LRB- which cost $ 66 million -RRB- is performing admirably , while `` We Bought A Zoo '' -LRB- which cost $ 50 million -RRB- kind of fizzled , to which I say : Huh ?! In eighth place is a movie which has actually fizzled -- at least domestically . `` The Adventures of Tintin , '' Steven Spielberg 's expensive motion-capture animation , dropped 42 percent this weekend to $ 6.6 million and $ 61.9 million total . In ninth place , Focus Features ' `` Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy , '' which expanded into 809 theaters this weekend , performed admirably in its wider release . The well-reviewed spy drama maintained a robust $ 7,129 per theater average , giving the film a $ 5.8 million weekend and an early $ 10.4 million total after five weekends . `` New Year 's Eve '' held onto a spot in the Top 10 for one final weekend . The ensemble romantic comedy fell 48 percent to $ 3.3 million . The film has earned $ 52 million -LRB- less than half the gross of Valentine 's Day -RRB- , and it likely wo n't make it much further . 1 . The Devil Inside - $ 34.5 million 2 .

184,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The second-highest ranking official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani 's political party resigned Saturday , along with four other high-ranking Kurdish politicians , officials said . Iraqi President Jalal Talabani could be jeopardized by the resignations of five key members of his party . Khosrat Rasul , the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government , resigned , along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , according to Kurdish lawmakers . Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan , a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq . It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . `` It looks very serious , '' said Ala Talabani , the president 's niece and a PUK member , as well as a member of Parliament . She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya , long a stronghold of the PUK . `` It 's about corruption , '' Ala Talabani said of the resignations . `` They are asking about the resources and the money . Who is spending it . And who is in charge of the income of the party . '' `` It 's not good , '' said Mahmoud Othman , a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician . `` The PUK is one of the main two -LSB- Kurdish -RSB- players , '' he added . `` A problem like this will upset the whole situation . '' Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad 's control after the 1991 Gulf War . Since then , the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions , Talabani 's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party , led by Massoud Barzani . For several years throughout the 1990s , the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq . Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States ' overthrow of Hussein . For the past five years , the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region 's position in Iraq . Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions . They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan 's militia of pesh merga fighters . Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians . The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani , the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history . `` If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow , this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics , '' said Hiwa Osman , the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting . Iraq 's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May . Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms . This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers . Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power .",What is the name of Talabani 's party ?,Patriotic Union of Kurdistan

202,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Banana producer Chiquita will pay a $ 25 million fine and serve five years ' probation for once paying millions of dollars to groups in Colombia considered by the U.S. to be terrorist organizations , a Department of Justice spokesman said Tuesday . A worker at a banana plantation in Santa Maria , Colombia , in December 2000 . In so doing , the banana producer avoided prosecution for the company 's now-defunct payoff of Colombian terrorists protecting its most profitable banana-growing operation , according to terms of a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department . If approved by U.S. courts , the $ 25 million fine would represent the largest U.S. criminal penalty ever imposed under federal global terrorism sanction regulations , said Justice spokesman Dean Boyd . The regulations prohibit transactions with people who commit , threaten to commit or support U.S.-designated terrorists and establish penalties for doing so . Attorneys from the Justice Department 's National Security Division and federal prosecutors for the District of Columbia filed a joint sentencing motion Tuesday asking the court to accept the plea agreement , which was reached March 19 , Boyd said . A hearing on the matter is set for Monday . In its motion , the government asked that Chiquita Brands International be fined and sentenced to probation , as well as being required to implement an effective ethics program in connection with the company 's guilty plea , Boyd said . Federal prosecutors accused the Cincinnati-based company of paying more than $ 1.7 million to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia , a right-wing paramilitary group , in two parts of Colombia where the company grew bananas . The payments to the group , known as the AUC , went through the company 's Colombian subsidiary , Banadex , from 1997 to 2004 , according to court documents filed in the case . Court papers also say Chiquita paid Colombia 's two leftist guerrilla groups , the FARC -LRB- Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -RRB- and ELN -LRB- National Liberation Army -RRB- from about 1989 to 1997 . At the time , according to court documents , those groups controlled areas where the company grew bananas . The AUC , FARC and ELN are all combatants in Colombia 's decade-long civil war , and all have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States . In a written statement issued in March , Chiquita Brands International CEO Fernando Aguirre said the company viewed the plea agreement `` as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago . '' The company voluntarily disclosed the payments to the Justice Department in 2003 , he said , adding the payments were made `` to protect the lives of its employees . '' Court documents said the company began making the payments after a Banadex general manager met with the then-leader of the AUC , Carlos Castano . Castano told the manager that the AUC was preparing to drive FARC from Colombia 's Uraba region and asked for payments to be made to the AUC through private security companies . `` Castano sent an unspoken but clear message that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property , '' court documents said . Charges filed in the case said senior company executives knew about the payments to the AUC and , while checks were written to the security companies , the companies provided no actual services . In 2002 , after the U.S. government designated the AUC as a terrorist organization , Chiquita began paying the organization in cash , according to court documents , and continued the payments even after being told by outside counsel that the payments were illegal and should be stopped . In the motion filed Tuesday , federal prosecutors noted Chiquita 's cooperation in the investigation and its voluntary disclosure of its illegal activity , Boyd said . While the government considered filing additional charges in the matter , it decided not to `` after an extensive investigation and after considering critical evidence and information that Chiquita provided through its post-plea cooperation , '' he said . Chiquita sold Banadex to another company more than two years ago but remains one of the largest purchasers of bananas in Colombia .

Shiite Muslim women light candles early Friday at a shrine in the holy city of Karbala , Iraq . The first four attacks , which together killed 36 and wounded 124 , targeted Shiites ; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target . In the latest attack , a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad . Six people died , and 30 were wounded , the official said . The attack appeared to have targeted a police patrol ; three of the fatalities were police , the official said . But most of the carnage was directed at Shiite targets , with the highest single toll exacted in the northern city of Mosul , where a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque as a funeral was taking place , killing 30 people and wounding 100 , the official said . In another attack , a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying pilgrims in the Sadr City neighborhood , killing three and wounding eight , the official said . Also in Sadr City , a roadside bomb exploded near a car , killing one person and wounding seven . And in eastern Baghdad , a car carrying pilgrims was targeted , killing two people and wounding nine . Friday was the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration in Karbala celebrating the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi , the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites . Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims . According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam , Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi `` is expected to return at the end of time as the messianic imam who will restore justice and equity on Earth . '' Last Friday , bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously , killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques . The attacks fueled fears that sectarian violence could be reigniting in the country and called into question the ability of security forces to safeguard the population as U.S. troops have taken a back seat to their Iraqi counterparts . Though the number of casualties has dropped over the past year , Friday 's attacks show that an insurgency capable of wreaking havoc remains .

Jack Kemp , a former congressman from New York , was the GOP 's vice presidential candidate in 1996 . A onetime professional football player , Kemp served nine terms in Congress as a representative from New York and was former Sen. Bob Dole 's running mate in 1996 . He was a leading advocate of `` supply-side '' tax cuts , advancing the argument that cutting taxes would boost economic growth and yield more revenue for the federal government . `` The only way to oppose a bad idea is to replace it with a good idea , and I like to think that I have spent my life trying to promote good ideas , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview . Kemp `` passed peacefully into the presence of the Lord '' Sunday evening , a family statement said . He disclosed his illness in January .

Critics mocked the policy as `` trickle-down '' economics and pointed to the decade 's growing budget deficits as evidence that supply-side theories did n't work , but it has been GOP orthodoxy ever since .

219,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three Pakistan international cricketers have been banned from the sport for the next five years after being found guilty at an anti-corruption hearing on Saturday . Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found to have been involved in `` spot-fixing '' -- a practice involving illegal gambling during matches . Butt , 26 , was banned for 10 years with half of that suspended on certain conditions while Asif , 28 , received a seven-year ban with 24 months suspended . Amir , 18 , was given a straight five-year penalty for his involvement in incidents during the Test series against England in August 2010 . They have 21 days to appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport . The International Cricket Council announced the punishments following an independent tribunal 's hearing in Qatar . It came a day after Britain 's Crown Prosecution Service charged the trio and their agent Mazhar Majeed with conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments , and conspiracy to cheat . Amir and Asif were accused of deliberately bowling no-balls -- deliveries which incur a scoring penalty and can not dismiss batsmen -- to the instructions of Majeed , who received money from a third party , while Butt was said to be aware of the arrangement . The conditions of the reduced sentences require Butt and Asif to refrain from further breaches of the anti-corruption code and to participate in an education program run by the Pakistan Cricket Board . Pakistan trio to face criminal charges The independent tribunal resumed its hearing on Saturday after adjourning on January 11 . It dismissed a charge that Butt had agreed to bat out a run-less -LRB- or `` maiden '' -RRB- over in the match played at London 's Oval ground from August 18-21 , but said the player failed to disclose to the ICC 's anti-corruption unit that Majeed had approached him with such a request . The main charges stem from the following match at Lord 's , the final Test of the series . `` The tribunal found that the charges under Article 2.1.1 of the Code that -LRB- respectively -RRB- Mr Asif agreed to bowl , and did bowl , a deliberate no-ball in the Lord 's Test match played between Pakistan and England from 26 to 29 August 2010 , Mr Amir agreed to bowl , and did bowl , two deliberate no-balls in the same Test , and Mr Butt was party to the bowling of those deliberate no-balls , were proved , '' it said in a statement on the ICC website on Saturday . Amir is the youngest bowler to claim 50 Test wickets , six of which came at Lord 's as Pakistan lost to England by an innings and 225 runs . Butt has played in 33 Test matches since making his debut for Pakistan in 2003 , and scored 1,889 runs . He became captain of the side in 2010 and led his country in a Test series against Australia as well as the tour of England before being replaced by Misbah-ul-Haq in the wake of the scandal . Asif has twice tested positive for steroids , resulting in year-long bans , and in 2008 was detained for three weeks after being found in possession of illegal substances at Dubai airport .",Who was found guilty of spot-fixing ?,captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir
220,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Accused enemy combatant Ali al-Marri was served with an arrest warrant Tuesday and transferred out of U.S. military custody for the first time since 2003 , according to the U.S. Justice Department . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . Al-Marri 's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday . Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the Qatari man to the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the hearing . On Friday , the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss al-Marri 's challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely and without charges . The high court ruled that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges . The court 's ruling means there is no resolution of the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain people accused of terrorism and other crimes in the United States . The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in virtual isolation in a Navy brig in Charleston , South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . Al-Marri had been accused of being an al Qaeda `` sleeper agent , '' but until the indictment had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . The 43-year-old man will be sent at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . He subsequently issued a presidential memorandum ordering Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , saying it was `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri -- a legal resident of the United States -- had remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and were challenging the constitutionality of his detention . The Pentagon asserts al-Marri had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to a government filing with the Supreme Court .",What is al-Marri accused of being ?,al Qaeda `` sleeper agent
221,"DURBAN , South Africa -- India 's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket 's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday . Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad Paul Collingwood 's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban . England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians , who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday 's must-win clash with the hosts . Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history , needing just 12 deliveries , as India made 218-4 . The left-hander 's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket . South Africa 's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year , while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches . Singh 's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over , in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once . Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls , putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir , who hit 58 off 41 deliveries . Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs , while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45 . In reply , England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs . Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls , and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries , but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh . Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs , while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28 . If India can beat South Africa , it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through . The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand , who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat . South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday , then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89 . Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs . He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings , having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2 . Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs -LRB- 19 -RRB- before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher . Boucher departed for 23 , caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie , who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs . The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp , and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory . The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis , hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday 's five-run win against England . McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent , scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel 's four victims . Morkel , who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs , then removed Ross Taylor -LRB- 1 -RRB- two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15 . He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher , and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove .

222,"Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli government ministers Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a temporary freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank in an effort to restart peace talks with the Palestinians . The Security Cabinet voted 11-2 in favor of the measure which calls for a 10-month freeze on new building permits and the construction of new residential buildings in the West Bank . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it `` a very big step toward peace '' and said he hoped the Palestinians would `` take full advantage '' of the opportunity to restart talks during the 10-month window . `` I hope the Palestinians and the Arab world will work with us to forge a new beginning ... for our children and for theirs , '' he said . In Washington , the top U.S. envoy for the region , George Mitchell , said he hoped to use the time to begin negotiations on permanent status issues , which include security for Israelis and Palestinians , borders , refugees and the status of Jerusalem . `` My personal and fervent wish is that we will , during this process at some point , have a resolution of borders so there will no longer be any question about settlement construction , '' Mitchell told reporters . `` It falls short of a full settlement freeze , but it is more than any Israeli government has done before , and can help move toward agreement between the parties , '' Mitchell told a briefing at the State Department . He said he plans to return soon to the region . Mitchell shrugged off a suggestion he might be discouraged after more than 10 months of failing to relaunch peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians . `` You ca n't take as final the first ` no , ' the second ` no ' or even the hundredth ` no , ' '' said Mitchell , who helped negotiate a peace agreement in Northern Ireland and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom . `` You ca n't get discouraged by setbacks and you ca n't be deterred by criticism . You have to be patient , persevering and determined . '' Mitchell also released a statement from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , which said the announcement helps move the issue forward . `` We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines , with agreed swaps , and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet Israeli security requirements , '' the Clinton statement said . `` Let me say to all the people of the region and world : our commitment to achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering , '' the Clinton statement added . Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , a representative of the Middle East Diplomatic Quartet made up of the European Union , the United States , the Russian Federation and the United Nations , called the announcement `` an important step towards creating the possibility for serious and credible negotiations for a two-state solution . `` The key , as I have said consistently , is to combine a credible political negotiation with real change on the ground , in institution-building , security performance and economic development , '' Blair said . But Danny Danon , a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu 's Likud Party and chairman of the Settlers Council , opposed the announcement . `` If the prime minister will implement the ideology of the left , he will not get the support of his own party , '' he said . `` All the things he wrote in his books , said in his speeches , he so eloquently preached for , he does exactly the opposite , '' said Danon , calling the move a `` disappointment . '' Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said the proposed temporary freeze would be inadequate : `` The exclusion of Jerusalem is a very serious problem for us , '' he told reporters on Wednesday . Palestinian officials , including Fayyad , have called on Israel to freeze construction in Jerusalem as well . The Palestinians want Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state . In recent weeks , Netanyahu and other members of his cabinet have made clear that a construction freeze would not be implemented in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem . Israel views Jerusalem as a separate issue to be hammered out in final status talks with the Palestinians . The measure would not affect buildings already under construction for the existing Jewish residents in the West Bank , Netanyahu said . Construction of public building would also continue , government officials have said . The Israeli government is under tremendous pressure -- particularly from its ally , the United States -- to halt settlement construction in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank . Continued construction has been a key stumbling block in restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks . The Israeli Security Cabinet is a subset of the larger Israeli Cabinet . It has historically been used by prime ministers to approve quick action on defense and diplomatic matters .

225,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States , prosecutors said Tuesday . Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb . Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws . Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said . Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals . Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes . Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration . Lawson and Ogren had neither . `` These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , '' said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent . `` This particular animal tested negative , '' he said . Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , `` but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . '' Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States . The journal also described the pair 's `` acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , '' McDevitt 's office said . Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant . `` The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , '' the statement from McDevitt 's office said . Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife . He will be sentenced in January . Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 . The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane , Washington , to Bangkok on November 4-5 , 2007 , with stops in Seattle , Washington , and Inchon , South Korea . They returned on a direct flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles , California , on November 28 , 2007 .",What is the maximum penalty for a smuggling conviction ?,"20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine"
229,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Masters -- April 9-12 , 2009 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson puts the green jacket on 2008 winner Trevor Immelman . While The Open Championship at St Andrews , Scotland may rival it for history , few would argue that the U.S. Masters tournament is unrivalled in terms of beauty and exclusivity . Played at the prestigious Augusta National Golf club in the city of Augusta , Georgia , the first `` major '' of the golfing year is a strictly invitational event controlled by the club itself . The top 50 golfers in the official world rankings are all guaranteed an invite . The dramatic azalea-draped course -- the brainchild of golfing great Bobby Jones -- provides a tough test for the world 's elite golfers , particularly since it has been lengthened or `` Tiger-proofed '' in recent years . However the relatively short 12th hole , named Golden Bell , is arguably the most challenging . Jack Nicklaus once called it `` the hardest tournament hole in golf , '' due to the fact that its perilously narrow green is protected in front by Rae 's Creek , with two sand traps behind it . Misjudge the wind or get your club selection wrong and the ball will most likely end up in the water . Since Horton Smith won the inaugural Masters title in 1934 , the tournament has become as famous for its traditions as it has for the quality of golf on show . Winners are presented with a green jacket by the defending champion -- which they are obliged to return to the clubhouse the following year . Nicklaus , nicknamed the `` Golden Bear , '' became the first golfer to successfully defend his green jacket . He also holds the record for the most titles won at Augusta with six -- his last coming in 1986 at the age of 46 . American players currently dominate the competition , following a period in the 1980s and 1990s which saw European players , including Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo , win 10 titles in 17 years . Current world number one Tiger Woods has won four times at Augusta since 1997 , while compatriot and rival for top spot , Phil Mickelson , won in 2004 and 2006 . South Africa 's Trevor Immelman is the current owner of the coveted green jacket . 2008 season in pictures '' U.S. Open - June 15-21 , 2009 Tiger Woods and his caddie walk up to the 18th green on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park in 2002 . The second of the four major tournaments , the U.S. Open is hosted by the United States Golf Association -LRB- USGA -RRB- . Since its inaugural event in 1895 at the Newport Golf and Country Club , the event has been staged at a number of different courses . What 's your favorite tournament ? It was n't until 1913 that the U.S. Open championship really caught the imagination when a young American amateur , Francis Ouimet , stunned the golf world by defeating famous English professionals , Harry Vardon and Ted Ray , in a playoff . The format of the tournament has changed several times . The USGA extended the championship to 72 holes in 1898 , with 36 holes played on each of two days . In 1926 , the format was changed to 18 holes played each of two days , then 36 holes on the third day . In 1965 , the present format of four 18-hole daily rounds was implemented for the first time . Over the years , much has been made of the way U.S. Open courses have been set up , with incredibly tough pin positions and rough thick enough to require a compass to navigate through . `` Sometimes the players feel -LSB- the USGA -RSB- has gotten a little close to the edge on some holes , '' defending champion Retief Goosen told the BBC at Pinehurst , North Carolina in 2005 . Two years later , when Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania hosted the tournament , World Golf.com quoted Tiger Woods as saying `` a 10-handicapper did n't stand a chance at breaking 100 '' on a course that boasts over 200 deep bunkers . Bobby Jones , Jack Nicklaus , Ben Hogan , Willie Anderson and Hale Irwin have all triumphed at the U.S. Open on four occasions , while Woods , who won last year 's event at Torrey Pines following a dramatic playoff victory over Rocco Mediate , counts three so far among his haul of 14 major titles . The U.S. Open is the only major that requires participants to play-off over 18 holes . This year 's event at Bethpage State Park 's Black Course in Farmingdale , New York should be familiar to Woods , as he won here in 2002 . At 7,214-yards , the municipally-owned Bethpage was the longest U.S. Open course in history . The aptly-named Black Course even carries a warning sign about its difficulty on the first tee . In 2002 , American Hale Irwin missed the cut for only the sixth time in 33 Open starts after two torrid rounds of 82 and 81 . `` They can go out and write a new book and title it , ` Massacre at ... wherever the heck we are , '' U.S. Open.com quoted him as saying . It remains to be seen whether the recently-injured Tiger can tame the course once again . Watch more about Woods ' comeback '' The Open Championship -- July 16-19 , 2009 Padraig Harrington -LRB- right -RRB- and Greg Norman line up putts during the 2008 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale . Organized by the R&A , which takes its name from Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews , Scotland , The -LRB- British -RRB- Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments . It is also the only one held outside of the United States . First held in October , 1860 , The Open was mostly played in Scotland during its early years . Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire was the birthplace of the event , which saw just eight players compete in its inaugural year . A year later the tournament was declared open to the whole world and the event has been known simply as `` The Open '' ever since . Since the early days , the R&A has established a rota of British seaside `` links '' courses to host the event . The major difference between a links course and a parkland course -- such as Augusta -- is that it is far less manufactured . Links courses are constructed out of the sandy , windswept coastal terrain , with few `` man-made '' additions . Players are faced with thick rough , narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes , and lightening quick greens . There are far fewer trees and water hazards . When the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination . This year 's tournament will be held on the famous Ailsa course at Turnberry on the west coast of Scotland . With its dramatic views and elevated cliff-top holes , the 7,200 yard course previously hosted The Open in 1977 , 1986 , 1994 . The winning aggregate scores in 1977 and 1994 rank among the lowest recorded in Open history , largely because the wind was n't blowing as it can . Current Open champion Padraig Harrington will arrive at Turnberry looking to win the tournament for the third time in as many years . At Carnoustie in 2007 , Harrington became the first Irishman to win The Open since Fred Daly in 1947 . He defended his title the following year at Royal Birkdale , finishing four strokes ahead of England 's Ian Poulter . Harrington has a long way to go before matching the great Harry Vardon 's record of six Open victories between 1896 and 1914 . Surprisingly , U.S. golfers -- more used to parkland courses -- have enjoyed great success in the competition in recent years , with 10 wins in 12 years . Tiger Woods , who missed out through injury last year , lifted the Claret Jug in 2000 , 2005 and 2006 . U.S. PGA Championship -- August 10-16 , 2009 Harrington pumps his fist as he sinks a putt to win the 2008 U.S. PGA Championship at Oakland Hills . The final major of the year , The PGA Championship is organized by the Professional Golfers Association of America -LRB- PGA of America -RRB- and is also held at a different course each year . The brainchild of New York salesman Rodman Wannamaker , the first PGA Championship was held at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville , New York in 1916 -- the same year the PGA of America was founded . The winners ' trophy is named after him . The competition , which was only switched from a matchplay to a strokeplay format in 1958 , does not allow amateurs to compete . It always attracts a world class field , in addition to a number of ordinary club professionals in the United States who can qualify through a national tournament . This year 's tournament will be held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska , Minnesota , the scene of Rich Beem 's defeat of a charging Tiger Woods in 2002 . Beem , an unknown club professional who also sold car stereos , held off Woods by recording birdies in his final four holes for a 68 that gave him victory by just one shot . The 7,149-yard course is ranked among the top courses in the United States , according to the PGA . Its signature 16th hole features a wide open fairway that narrows into a long peninsula featuring an elevated green protected by Lake Hazeltine . This year Padraig Harrington will attempt to defend the trophy , a year after he pulled off a dramatic victory over Spain 's Sergio Garcia at Oakland Hills . If he succeeds he will become only the second man -- after Tiger Woods -- to be back-to-back PGA Champion . However , both men lag behind Jack Nicklaus , who won a record-equaling fifth U.S.PGA title in 1980 at Oak Hill , Rochester -- the hometown of Walter Hagen , the player whose record Nicklaus tied .",Where is the Masters always held ?,"Augusta National Golf club in the city of Augusta , Georgia"
238,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Qatari man held for years in military custody in the United States was charged Friday in federal court with conspiracy `` to provide material support and resources '' to al Qaeda , prosecutors announced . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . The Supreme Court was to hear arguments in April on a challenge by the suspect , Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri , to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges . The Justice Department on Friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal . `` Because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended , no live controversy remains in this case , '' said Obama administration lawyers in their brief . Al-Marri 's lawyers oppose such a move , saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered . The federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution . Andy Savage , one of al-Marri 's lawyers , visited him at the naval brig in North Charleston , South Carolina , on Friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism . `` He denies it , '' Savage said . `` I 'm sure he 'll enter a not guilty plea . '' Savage said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment . `` We 'd like information about what he 's supposed to have done , '' he said . `` You 'd think after 7 1/2 years they 'd have a little more to say . `` The most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future . Before , he did n't know if he 'd be charged , be repatriated or held forever . '' The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . He had been accused of being an al Qaeda sleeper agent , but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . He will be transferred at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . Oral arguments in the case are scheduled April 27 . A Justice Department official said the White House will release an official presidential order to transfer al-Marri into civilian custody . Al-Marri 's lawyer applauded the move . `` This indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts . This case is now finally where it belongs : in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether Mr. al-Marri is guilty of a crime , '' said Jonathan Hafetz , an ACLU attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . Obama late Friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , calling it `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri , a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States , has remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention . They said his cell at the brig in South Carolina is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world , including his family . Military officials deny mistreatment . The case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations . President George W. Bush ordered al-Marri confined in military custody , and the Bush Justice Department had been filing the appeals opposing al-Marri 's legal claims . At issue was whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil . Al-Marri arrived in the United States the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria . He had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier . Weeks later , he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home . At an early court hearing , a prosecutor said al-Marri was believed to be an associate of al Qaeda , the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks . The case against al-Marri escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated al Qaeda detainees , the government said . Although al-Marri was not charged with terrorism-related offenses , Bush in June 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an `` enemy combatant '' and transferring him to military custody . That move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention . The declaration alleges al-Marri engaged in `` hostile and warlike acts '' working as an `` al Qaeda sleeper agent '' who was planning to `` hack into the computer systems of U.S banks , '' for a possible follow-up to the 9/11 attacks . The Pentagon said he had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to the government 's filing with the high court . A lawyer for Jose Padilla , an American citizen detained as an enemy combatant , said the government 's actions in the al-Marri case echo those in Padilla 's , in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the Supreme Court . `` This is deja vu all over again -- what the Bush administration did with Padilla , the Obama administration is trying to do with al-Marri , '' he said . `` Transferring al-Marri out of the brig is the right thing to do . Moving to dismiss the case is not . '' The case is U.S. v. al-Marri -LRB- 09-CR-10030 -RRB- .

The Knesset 's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote . Knesset seats are divided according to each party 's proportion of the overall vote . But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat . Participation in elections , including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population , has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout , according to Israeli government figures . Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters . Israel usually holds national elections every four years . But this year 's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni 's failure to form a coalition . Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim . Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel ; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself . Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition . Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections , including major parties such as Kadima , Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties . The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel 's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition . The prime minister-designate then has 28 days , extendable by 14 days , to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members . Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2 .",When does Isrel go to the nation polls for the election ?,February 10
241,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` A calculated , cold-blooded predator . '' That was how Connecticut Judge James Bentivegna described a then 22-year-old Joshua Komisarjevsky on December 20 , 2002 , when the defendant was sentenced after being convicted on 12 counts of burglary . Today , Komisarjevsky -- now 31 -- sits in a Connecticut courtroom , where a jury will weigh his guilt on murder charges , and potentially pave the way for a death sentence . Prosecutors say that on July 23 , 2007 , Komisarjevsky and an accomplice , Steven Hayes , invaded the home of Dr. William Petit , raped and strangled his wife , Jennifer Hawke-Petit , molested one of their daughters , and set the house on fire before attempting to flee . Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit -- died in the invasion of their Cheshire , Connecticut , home . Dr. William Petit , although severely beaten , managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor 's residence . Hayes was sentenced to death in December , after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths . Both suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the Petit invasion . Komisarjevsky 's long rap sheet , in particular , suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth . Officials with the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to speak with CNN , citing a gag order in the case . But over 200 pages of Komisarjevsky 's parole records have been released , which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused . One of his former attorneys , William Gerace , said that Komisarjevsky came from a close , religious family . But at the age of 14 , he began using drugs -- the same year , he claims , that he found out that he was adopted . By 18 , Komisarjevsky had found his drugs of choice : crystal meth and cocaine . He told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit . Yet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints Komisarjevsky as more than just the average thief . According to a police statement read aloud in court that day , Komisarjevsky admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old . `` I always wore gloves , with the exception of one incident when I was 14 . I always acted alone . Approximately a year and a half ago , I acquired night vision goggles ... I used the night-vision equipment during the burglaries -LRB- over -RRB- the past year , '' he said , according to the transcript . Gerace , who was Komisarjevsky 's defense attorney at the time , stressed that a need for money , to pay for drugs , drove his client . But he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual . `` Ninety-nine percent of burglaries are -LRB- committed by -RRB- junkies -- there 's nothing romantic about what they do , '' said Gerace . `` That was the first time I 'd seen something as exotic as that . '' Komisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial . They said his affinity for breaking into people 's homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation , since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home . Speaking during his December 2002 sentencing , Komisarjevsky appeared repentant . He addressed the court saying , `` I 've turned my back on my faith in God and my family . And in doing so , I fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs ... the crimes I committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders . '' But the judge was not moved by Komisarjevsky 's show of remorse , sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole , which has greater restrictions than typical probation . In April 2007 , he was paroled . And three months later , Komisarjevsky was arrested for the Petit home invasion and murders . What happened then , and what may have driven Komisarjevsky , remains a mystery to Gerace , his former attorney . `` He was a very complex young man . I do n't think I 've met anyone quite that complex , and I sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with , '' Gerace said . `` I wish him well , and I hope the jury makes the right decision .

242,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A missing 5-year-old Florida girl was most likely abducted from her home in rural Florida , police said Wednesday . Haleigh Cummings , 5 , went missing Monday night from her home near Orlando , police said . Haleigh Cummings has been missing since 3 a.m. Tuesday , when her father 's girlfriend called 911 to say the child had vanished from her Putnam County home . `` There 's no longer any reason to believe that the child simply wandered outside , '' said Putnam County Sheriff 's Office Maj. Gary Bowling . The police must `` assume abduction , '' he said . `` All the answers to why you 'd want to take a 5-year-old are ugly , '' Bowling said . Police have no official suspects , but are treating everyone they interview as one . `` All the world 's a suspect '' now , Bowling said . Hear the frantic 911 call '' A nationwide Amber Alert says the girl was last seen wearing a pink shirt and underwear . Police plan to use infrared aviation technology after dark Wednesday in their search . `` She 's a 5-year-old child , and she 's afraid of the dark , '' Bowling said . On Monday night , Ronald Cummings ' girlfriend , 17-year-old Misty Croslin , was watching Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother , police said . Croslin put Haleigh to bed at 8 p.m. and then went to bed herself at 10 p.m. , they said . Croslin told police she woke up at 3 a.m. and discovered Haleigh missing . Croslin then called 911 and told a dispatcher that she found a brick on the floor of the family 's double-wide trailer , according to CNN affiliate WJXT-TV . The station 's Web site printed the text of the 911 call , which included this exchange : Dispatch : OK . All right , you said your back door was wide open ? Caller : Yes , with a brick . Like , there was a brick on the floor . Like , when I went to sleep the door was not like that . The brick was actually holding open the door to the trailer , Putnam County Sheriff 's Office Lt. Johnny Greenwood told CNN . Croslin is staying with relatives as the investigation continues , said Bowling , describing the girlfriend as a `` child herself . '' Earlier Wednesday , Cummings pleaded for his daughter 's safe return . `` All I want is my child ... please ... all I want is my child , '' he said , his voice breaking . On Wednesday , Haleigh 's maternal grandmother , Marie Griffis , told reporters that she feared the worst . `` She 's out there somewhere , I can feel her . I can feel her presence , '' Griffis told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV . `` She 's screaming . '' Watch grandparents plead for girl 's return '' Haleigh 's mother , Crystal Sheffield , wept as she stood in front of reporters . `` I just want whoever 's got her to bring her home , '' the girl 's mother said . `` That 's all I want , is my baby home . '' Watch mother 's tearful plea '' Griffis said that her daughter and Ronald Cummings had a `` rocky relationship '' and that the two took turns spending weekends with their daughter . Sheffield lives near the Florida-Georgia line and has been interviewed by law enforcement , according to police . Investigators are looking into various angles of the case , including finding out the location of 44 registered sexual offenders who live within a five-mile radius of the Cummings home , Greenwood said . Though that number may sound high , it includes both Putnam and Palatka counties , which are separated by the St. Johns River , the law enforcement spokesman told CNN .

243,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Andrew Sable was n't in the market for new wheels , but he says the federal `` cash for clunkers '' program helped him get an offer he could n't refuse . `` I 'd have been foolish not to take it , '' said Andrew Sable , who got $ 9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee . The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend . Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it , even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $ 2,000 at best . But , aware of the program that started this month , Sable took a $ 4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new , more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser . And Chrysler , eager to sell vehicles , threw in its own $ 4,500 incentive . The $ 9,000 in savings knocked the price to $ 8,900 before taxes and fees . `` I 'll never get $ 9,000 for this old vehicle -LSB- any other way -RSB- . I 'd have been foolish not to take it , '' the 43-year-old Sable , an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore , New York , told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com . He 'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan . iReport.com : Read Sable 's account of the purchase Under the $ 1 billion program , people will be given credits of $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient . The old vehicles are crushed or shredded . Watch CNN 's Gerri Willis explain the `` cash for clunkers '' program '' The exact credit offered through the program -- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 , or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets . Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type . New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg . New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg . New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg . The government put Sable 's old Jeep at 15 mpg . His new PT Cruiser , which the program classifies as an SUV , gets a combined 21 mpg . Part of the program 's intent is to get vehicles with low fuel efficiency off the road . Caroline Radtke , a 31-year-old who wrote about her purchase on iReport.com , was happy to oblige . Radtke and her husband this month got a $ 4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper -LRB- 15 mpg -RRB- to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen , a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg . After the credit , they paid just under $ 26,000 . `` What was going out of my -LSB- old -RSB- vehicle was bad for the planet , and you 're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast , '' Radtke , a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio , Texas , told CNN after filing her iReport . `` After driving it for eight and a half years , I wanted something more productive financially and more friendly to the Earth . '' The couple would have bought a new car without CARS , but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have , Radtke said . If they had sold the Trooper themselves , they might have gotten $ 3,000 if they were lucky , she said . iReport.com : Radtke 's purchase The CARS program is n't for everyone . The credit wo n't go toward used-car purchases . Also , people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it . But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan , a Salt Lake City , Utah , woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck , which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg . She and her husband already had a newer vehicle , but she used the truck to go to work and for other in-town purposes . But lately it started having shifting problems , and it was occasionally slipping going uphill . Like Sable , Callahan , 39 , got $ 4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser . And , like Sable , she also received a separate $ 4,500 credit from Chrysler . She 'll be paying about $ 10,000 for her new vehicle after taxes and fees . The $ 9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler is n't too shabby , considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles . iReport.com : How Callahan got $ 9,000 for her truck `` Without the incentives , I probably would n't have purchased a brand new vehicle , '' Callahan , who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah , told CNN after filing her iReport .

245,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four senators pushed for a bill Wednesday to ban texting while driving , a day after a study found that drivers who text while on the road are much more likely to have an accident than undistracted drivers . A law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving . Sens. Chuck Schumer , D-New York ; Robert Menendez , D-New Jersey ; Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan , D-North Carolina , unveiled the ALERT Act , which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving . The proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle , said an earlier news release from the senators . If the bill passes , the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance . States that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill 's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds , Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation . The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards , Schumer said . CTIA , a cellular phone industry group , said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving . `` CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving , '' said a statement on CTIA 's Web site . Fourteen states , including the home states of three of the bill 's sponsors , and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving : Alaska , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , Tennessee , Utah , Virginia and Washington . Interactive map : See state-by-state policies on distracted driving '' New York does not ban texting while driving but has barred the use of handheld phones while driving , according to the Governor 's Highway Safety Association . Schumer said New York 's legislature has sent Gov. David Paterson a bill to ban texting as well . `` The legislation will send an important message to drivers across the country : Get your hands off the cell phone and back on the wheel , '' Schumer said . The senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers . Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting When compared with dialing , talking , listening or reaching for an electronic device , texting posed the greatest accident risk , the study found . It attributed the increased risk to the almost five seconds it found that the driver 's eyes were off the roadway while texting , said Rich Hanowski , the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute . `` Not having -LSB- a cell phone -RSB- in your hand while driving could be the difference between life and death , '' Menendez said . In September , a commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend , leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people in California , according to federal investigators . The accident also injured 101 people . In May , 62 people were injured when one trolley struck another in Boston , Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said . In July , the operator of one trolley was charged with gross negligence after he admitted to texting seconds before the accident with the other trolley , according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official .

254,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cheryl Reed 's morning routine starts like that of millions of other mothers around the country . She makes breakfast for her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter , piles them into a minivan and drops them off at school . Cheryl Reed has a rare form of breast cancer that mostly affects young African-American women . It 's the next stop that sets Reed apart from other women . Three weeks a month , she heads to the infusion center at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , for chemotherapy treatments . Reed , 40 , has breast cancer ; not just any form of the disease , but a rare , aggressive and difficult to treat version called triple negative . Of the estimated 180,000 women who learn they have invasive breast cancer this year in the United States , about 15 percent will have triple negative . Like Reed , the majority of triple negative patients will be young African-American women . `` It never occurred to me that I 'm going to die from this , '' Reed said . `` I was like , ` I 've got breast cancer , let 's take care of it . ' '' Reed did take care of it . For eight months during 2006 , she endured chemotherapy and radiation treatments . She thought the cancer was in remission , but it returned last November . This time , it had spread to her liver , lungs and chest wall . `` Triple negative cancers do tend to be aggressive in their natural histories , so they have a very high rate of recurrence or relapsing , '' explained Dr. Ruth O'Regan , Reed 's oncologist at the Winship Institute . She 's one of several breast cancer experts around the country who are trying to learn more about what causes triple negative and how to treat it more effectively . Dr. Funmi Olopade , a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago , was at the forefront of identifying triple negative and the trend among African-American women . She said what makes it different from other types of breast cancer is that women with the disease lack three hormone receptors known to fuel most breast cancer tumors : estrogen , progesterone and HER2 . Health Minute : More on triple negative breast cancer '' `` When you have triple negative , it means that we can not use hormone therapy . ... The only way we can treat that type of breast cancer is to use chemotherapy , '' Olopade said . Tamoxifen and Herceptin , two of the most effective medications for treating breast cancer , do n't work for triple negative breast cancer patients . But if a patient responds well to chemotherapy , Olopade said , there 's a very good chance of curing the disease . `` The challenge we have is when the cancer comes back , '' she added . `` Right now , we do n't have any effective way to treat it , and that 's why when it comes back , it tends to be deadly . '' Reed is enrolled in a clinical trial at the Winship center where she 's receiving chemotherapy along with a drug called Avastin , which cuts the blood supply to cancer cells . Olopade is hoping better drugs will be available in the next two to five years that will help eradicate triple negative cancer cells . In the meantime , she stressed , early detection is the key to recovery , especially for women at highest risk . `` In this country , what we have found was young African-American women have a rate that is higher than young white women , and we do n't know if that is because of a gene or other risk factors , '' Olopade said . `` We know that women with a family history of breast cancer who have a BRCA1 mutation are most at risk , '' she said . BRCA1 is a major breast cancer-causing gene that was identified 14 years ago . Olopade said women born with the defective gene have a higher chance of getting breast cancer and at a younger age . Olopade also wants to explore further whether triple negative rates are higher among women who do not breastfeed their children . `` It 's that first pregnancy and first breastfeeding that really allows the breast to become fully mature , '' she said . She worried that in general , `` African-Americans are not likely to breastfeed , as they are getting in the work force and returning to work soon after childbirth . '' Even with several clues , Olopade acknowledged that researchers still do n't know a lot about triple negative breast cancer and more study is needed . She encouraged all young women , no matter what their race , to talk to their doctor about doing a risk assessment for the BRCA1 gene . If there is a family history of the gene mutation , some physicians may tell a woman not wait until she turns 40 to get her first mammogram . `` We begin screening as early at 25 , '' Olopade said . `` Many of the women are surviving . They are beating the odds of dying because they know they can do preventive approaches to reduce their risk of dying . '' Reed is trying to increase her chances of survival by getting experimental treatment in the clinical trial . She seems to be responding well , but she 's realistic . `` There 's always the possibility that once this is done , it could be two years and I 'm back in treatment again , '' she said . `` It really is a part of my life now . ... I 'm a survivor . '' CNN 's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report .","what kind of breast cancer is rare , aggressive and difficult to treat ?",triple negative
260,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963 . Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . But a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . Last week 's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki , a member of Kenya 's largest Kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe . The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya 's population . Mostly originating from Kenya 's central highlands , the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . Kenya 's first post-independence leader , Jomo Kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a Kikuyu . Kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of Kenyatta 's successor , Daniel Arap Moi , a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe , Kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected . This week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history . But the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . Kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy . However , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . E-mail to a friend",Who is challenging President Kibaki ?,opposition leader Raila Odinga

265,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a second vaccine intended to protect against cervical cancer . GlaxoSmithKline has manufactured a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer . Cervarix , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline , was approved Friday for prevention of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus -LRB- HPV -RRB- types 16 and 18 . The vaccine is approved for use in girls and women ages 10 to 25 years and is to be administered in three doses . After the initial shot , the second and third doses are to be given within six months . `` The licensure of Cervarix adds another option in the prevention of cervical cancer , '' said Dr. Karen Midthun , acting director of the FDA 's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research . `` It has the potential to save lives from cervical cancer as well as reduce the need for biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the necessary follow-up from abnormal Pap tests . '' According to GlaxoSmithKline , the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions , regardless of HPV type . `` The vaccine contains two HPV types -LRB- 16 & 18 -RRB- responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in North America , '' said Sarah Alspach , a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman . `` But approximately 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by other cancer-causing HPV types . Cervarix has been shown to reduce the incidence of pre-cancers resulting from cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18 . '' The vaccine will be available this year , according to GSK , which did not divulge the price . Cervarix will be competing with Merck & Company 's Gardasil , the first cervical cancer vaccine , which won FDA approval in June 2006 . Gardasil , for girls and women ages 9 to 26 , prevents against cervical , vulvar and vaginal cancers and protects against HPV types 11 , 16 and 18 . Gardasil 's approval has been broadened by the FDA to include an indication for boys and young men ages 9 through 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11 . `` This vaccine is the first preventive therapy against genital warts in boys and men ages 9 through 26 , and , as a result , fewer men will need to undergo treatment for genital warts . '' Midthun said . According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention , HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the nation . More than 40 types of HPV can infect genital areas , according to the disease agency . But because many of them are not visible to the naked eye , most people who become infected do n't know it .",Who approved the hpv vaccine ?,The Food and Drug Administration
266,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as `` a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .",What does it call marriage ?,the union of a man and a woman
268,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old , the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births . A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul , Afghanistan , in October 2007 . The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases . Each year , 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb , the organization said . More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia . `` Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally , physically and financially on families , medical systems and economies , '' March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement . `` In the United States alone , the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $ 26 billion . '' The March of Dimes report , which used data collected by the World Health Organization , breaks down premature birth rates by continent . The highest premature birth rate is in Africa , where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm , with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually . In populous Asia , although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent , the number of premature births is higher , at nearly 7 million a year . While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year , its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa , at 10.6 percent of all births , according to the report . The rate is the world 's second highest . In the United States , the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years , with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase , the organization found . Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births . `` Wherever trend data are available , rates of preterm birth are increasing , '' the report said . Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks , including the possible development of cerebral palsy , blindness , hearing loss , learning disabilities and other chronic conditions , according to the March of Dimes . `` Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers , researchers , health care providers , the media , donor organizations and other stakeholders , '' the report said . `` The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial/ethnic lines in many high-income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve , '' it added . The March of Dimes , a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research , said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers , including diabetes , high blood pressure , nutrition , body weight and tobacco and alcohol use . Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another . While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births , doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor , said Christopher Howson , vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes . `` While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low-resource settings , we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies , '' Howson said .",Who says nearly 10 percent of world 's births are premature ?,March of Dimes
269,"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes , Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943 . Putin , right , is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran . Putin , who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations , said that he and the other leaders agreed that `` peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed '' in the region . `` The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives , '' he said . Russia is building Iran 's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran . On Monday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration 's stance that `` all options '' must be kept `` on the table '' in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary . `` We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program , their willingness to live up to their rhetoric , their intentions for Iraq , or their ambitions in the Gulf region , '' Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs . The leaders of Iran , Russia , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world 's largest inland body of water . Speaking afterwards , Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran , The Associated Press reported . `` We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state , '' Putin said . `` The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states , therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here , '' added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Putin , defying reports of an assassination plot against him , was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran 's Mehrabad Airport . During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden , Germany , Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans . `` Of course I will travel to Iran , '' Putin said . `` If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time , I could never leave the house . '' Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin , with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless . `` Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and can not damage the trend of the prepared programs , '' spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency . Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media , particularly the U.S. media , saying the report was `` made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war . '' Putin 's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin 's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . `` Putin 's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia 's independence in global affairs . Putin , who approaches the end of his term , wants to demonstrate that he would n't cave in to the U.S. pressure , '' said Alexander Pikayev , an expert on Iran with Russia 's Institute for World Economy and International Relations , in a report carried by AP . Putin 's schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , AP said .

270,"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tens of thousands of South Koreans were demonstrating Saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government 's decision to import what they say is unsafe U.S. beef . South Korean protesters protest against government 's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday . South Korean police estimate that the crowd in Seoul is about 50,000 . No clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police , although ongoing protests have at times turned violent . South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban . That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003 . The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak , who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his Cabinet . Tens of thousands of auto workers in South Korea went on strike Wednesday to oppose the government 's lifting of the ban . After a series of negotiations , Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old . Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease , which can be transmitted to humans . The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease . The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports . Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals . The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997 . Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare and fatal malady in humans . Until the 2003 ban , South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters . South Korea 's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush . But the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks , along with a sense that South Korea had backed down too easily to American pressure . The government has vowed to get tough with the rallies . In Washington , the White House announced that Bush would visit South Korea on August 5-6 before heading to the Beijing Olympics . Bush had originally been expected to go to Seoul next week when he visits Japan for the G-8 summit , but the trip did not materialize amid the protests .

Dio , 67 , followed Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath 's lead vocalist in 1979 . `` Many , many friends and family were able to say their private goodbyes before he peacefully passed away , '' she wrote . `` Ronnie knew how much he was loved by all . '' The rock community paid tribute to Dio in messages late Sunday . `` In addition to his powerhouse vocal ability , Ronnie was a true gentleman who always emanated great warmth and friendship to us and everyone around him , '' KISS said . `` We will miss him . '' Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian called Dio 's death a big loss . `` So many memories of Ronnie . Toured together many times . He always had a kind word and a smile , and he loved the Yankees , '' Ian said . Musician Slash summed up the loss in one sentence : `` Ronnie died at 7:45 a.m. , but his music will live for eternity . '' Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx , who became friends with Dio while touring Europe , said the rocker will be missed . `` I still have this image of him standing on stage in front of 100,000 belting out ` Man on the Silver Mountain ' and remember the shivers it sent up my spine , '' Sixx said . He called Dio `` one of the kindest souls I have ever met and his talent was beyond inspirational to so many of us . '' `` Those of us that had the opportunity to know Ronnie can tell you what a wonderful and passionate man he was , '' Sixx said . Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell , a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons . All shows were canceled last March because of his illness . His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year 's Heaven and Hell album . Dio appeared frail , but he spoke while accepting his award . Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942 , Dio 's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s . His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s , when the group played heavy blues rock . Dio 's rock became darker with his band Rainbow , which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath . Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio , including `` Heaven and Hell '' in 1980 , `` Mob Rules '' in 1981 and `` Live Evil '' in 1982 . Dio left that band in 1982 , but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later .

Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq on Monday . President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , while separately two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the country 's Kurdish region . The diplomatic moves came after Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week . Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the Turkish-Iraqi border , the White House confirmed . National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism , and the importance of the United States , Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK . Bush has vowed to help Turkey fight PKK rebels . The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey , with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq . The United States and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization . Last week , Turkey 's ambassador to the United States , Nabi Sensoy , said his country 's maneuvers against Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq were based on intelligence provided by the United States . In the Kurdish Iraq city of Sulaimaniya , Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , who is Kurdish , and Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi , who is Sunni Arab , met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani .

277,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Korea , whose leader Kim Jong Il died over the weekend , is the least democratic nation on Earth , according to a newly released report by a British analysis and intelligence firm . The Democracy Index 2011 , compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit , listed Norway as the most democratic nation in the world . The top 10 spots in this year 's index were occupied mostly by European countries . Following Norway were : Iceland , Denmark , Sweden , New Zealand , Australia , Switzerland , Canada , Finland and the Netherlands . Read the full report The United States ranked 19th , down two spots from the 2010 listing . The United States ' 2011 ranking is below Canada -LRB- 8th -RRB- and the United Kingdom -LRB- 18th -RRB- . The United States also ranked below the Czech Republic -LRB- 16th -RRB- , a former Soviet communist satellite that did not become a democracy until 1989 , and the South American nation of Uruguay -LRB- 17th -RRB- , a former right-wing dictatorship that did not return to democracy until 1984 . The Economist Intelligence Unit analysis , released this month , concluded that democracy deteriorated in 48 countries , improved in 41 and stayed the same in 78 . In most regions , the report said , the level of democracy was lower in 2011 than the previous year . `` 2011 was an exceptionally turbulent year , characterized by sovereign debt crises and weak political leadership in the developed world , dramatic political change and conflict in the Middle East and North Africa and rising social unrest , '' said Laza Kekic , the report 's lead author . The Democracy Index is based on five categories : electoral process and pluralism , civil liberties , how government functions , political participation by the public , and political culture . The analysts measured the level of democracy in 165 nations and two territories , `` which account for almost the entire population of the world , '' the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a release . Using a scale of 0 to 10 , countries were placed in one of four categories : full democracies -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- , flawed democracies -LRB- 6 to 7.9 -RRB- , hybrid regimes -LRB- 4 to 5.9 -RRB- and authoritarian regimes -LRB- 0 to 3.9 -RRB- . Norway , the top-ranked nation , had a score of 9.8 . The Scandinavian nation also ranked No. 1 in 2010 with an identical score . North Korea , ranked No. 167 , had a score of 1.08 . The Asian nation also ranked last in 2010 , with the same score . The United States had a score of 8.11 , slightly lower than last year 's 8.18 . `` U.S. democracy has been adversely affected by a deepening of the polarization of the political scene and political brinkmanship and paralysis , '' the Economist Intelligence Unit concluded . The analysts noted that the United States and the United Kingdom lag behind many other full democracies for some of the same reasons . `` There has been a rise in protest movements , '' the report states . `` Problems in the functioning of government have become more prominent . '' Among other findings in the report : -- Slightly more than half the world 's population lives in some type of democracy , although only 11 % enjoy a `` full democracy . '' -- More than one-third of the globe 's population lives under authoritarian rule . -- Nearly half the nations on the planet are considered democracies : 25 `` full '' and 53 `` flawed . '' -- There were 37 `` hybrid regimes '' and 52 `` authoritarian regimes . '' -- Violence , drug trafficking and other crime in Latin America continue to hinder democracy . -- Eastern Europe continued to suffer a decline in democracy , with 12 nations worse than the previous year . -- Western Europe also had a decline in democracy , with seven nations deteriorating and none improving . Some of that deterioration was due to financial problems plaguing the eurozone . Five of the countries that lost points in the rankings belong to the eurozone : Greece , Italy , Portugal , Spain and Ireland . -- Eight countries had a listing change from one type of government to another in 2011 . Four were upgraded and four were downgraded . -- Countries that deteriorated were : Portugal -LRB- fell from full to flawed democracy -RRB- , Ukraine and Guatemala -LRB- flawed democracy to hybrid regime -RRB- and Russia -LRB- hybrid to authoritarian regime -RRB- . -- Zambia improved from a hybrid to a flawed democracy . Tunisia , Mauritania and Niger moved up from authoritarian to hybrid . In the Western Hemisphere , Costa Rica is ranked 20th , up five spots from last year .

The Economist Intelligence Unit , which performed the analysis , is based in London and reports having offices in more than 40 cities worldwide . The company says it has about 650 country experts and analysts worldwide . The Democracy Index 2011 was released December 15 . The latest Democracy Index closely mirrors a Corruption Perceptions Index released by the German watchdog organization Transparency International in late November . In that analysis , New Zealand was perceived as the least corrupt nation on earth , and Somalia and North Korea were seen as the most corrupt . The United States ranked 24th least corrupt on a `` corruption perceptions index , '' the fourth-best in the Western Hemisphere . Canada ranked 10th , the Bahamas was 21st and Chile was 22nd . Overall , the top spots were occupied mostly by European countries , with the exception of New Zealand , Singapore at No. 5 and Australia , which was tied for eighth with Switzerland . Other nations with top rankings were Denmark , Finland , Sweden , Norway and the Netherlands . In addition to Somalia and North Korea , which were tied for last at No. 182 , the bottom of the list included Myanmar , Afghanistan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Sudan , Iraq , Haiti and Venezuela . The report was prepared by the independent , nonpartisan Transparency International organization , which said it drew its conclusions based `` on different assessments and business opinion surveys carried out by independent and reputable institutions . '' The information used to compile the index included `` questions relating to the bribery of public officials , kickbacks in public procurement , embezzlement of public funds and questions that probe the strength and effectiveness of public-sector and anti-corruption efforts , '' Transparency International said . Perceptions are used , the organization said , because corruption is a hidden activity that is difficult to measure . `` Over time , '' the organization said in its report , `` perceptions have proved to be a reliable estimate of corruption . '' The rankings for other Western Hemisphere countries were : Uruguay -LRB- 25 -RRB- , Puerto Rico -LRB- 39 -RRB- , Costa Rica -LRB- 50 -RRB- , Cuba -LRB- 61 -RRB- , Brazil -LRB- 73 -RRB- , Colombia , El Salvador and Peru -LRB- tied for 80 -RRB- , Panama -LRB- 86 -RRB- , Argentina and Mexico -LRB- tied for 100 -RRB- , Bolivia -LRB- 118 -RRB- , Ecuador and Guatemala -LRB- tied for 120 -RRB- , the Dominican Republic and Honduras -LRB- tied for 129 -RRB- , Nicaragua -LRB- 134 -RRB- , Paraguay -LRB- 154 -RRB- , Venezuela -LRB- 172 -RRB- and Haiti -LRB- 175 -RRB- . The index used a scale of 0-10 to measure perceived corruption , with zero representing highly corrupt and 10 being very clean . New Zealand , the highest-ranked nation , has a 9.5 score . Somalia and North Korea , the lowest-ranked , had 1.0 . The United States scored 7.1 , while Canada was 8.7 and Chile was 7.2 . Haiti , the lowest-ranked nation in the Western Hemisphere , scored 1.8 . Next-worst was Venezuela with 1.9 . Transparency International , headquartered in Berlin , reports having 90 chapters worldwide . The organization says it works with partners in government , business and civil society to develop and implement effective measures to combat corruption .",What is Norway listed as,the most democratic nation in the world
278,"-LRB- CNN Student News -RRB- -- On November 11 , Americans pay tribute to everyone who has served in the U.S. military . But why was this particular date chosen , and how does this holiday differ from Memorial Day ? Origins of Veterans Day World War I , also known as `` The Great War , '' was fought from 1914 to 1918 . During this conflict , Great Britain , France , Russia , Belgium , Italy , Japan , the United States and other countries , which formed the `` Allies , '' defeated the so-called `` Central Powers , '' which included Germany , Austria-Hungary , Turkey -LRB- then the Ottoman Empire -RRB- and Bulgaria . On the `` eleventh hour , of the eleventh day , of the eleventh month '' of 1918 , German leaders signed an armistice , or a halt to hostilities , with the Allied powers . On that date , November 11 , celebrations were held in New York City , Paris , London and in other cities around the globe . The following year , President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as `` Armistice Day , '' a day to observe the end of World War I. On June 4 , 1926 , the U.S. Congress passed a resolution asking President Calvin Coolidge to call upon officials to `` display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches , or other suitable places , with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples . '' Twelve years later , on May 13 , 1938 , Congress passed an Act making the 11th of November Armistice Day , a federal holiday . Initially , Armistice Day was supposed to honor veterans of World War I . But after the call to arms and human sacrifices during World War II and the Korean conflict , veterans ' groups urged Congress to consider a day to celebrate U.S. veterans of all wars . On June 1 , 1954 , President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day . Difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day Veterans Day in the United States is a day to honor all Americans who have served in the U.S. military , both during wartime and in peace . Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring Americans who have died serving the nation , especially those who died in battle or from wounds received during armed conflicts . On Veterans Day , Americans thank the living veterans for their service to the country and recognize all who have served the country . Veterans Day Proclamation The following is the text of President George W. Bush 's 2008 Veterans Day Proclamation : On Veterans Day , we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the United States . From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia , from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan , brave patriots have protected our Nation 's ideals , rescued millions from tyranny , and helped spread freedom around the globe . America 's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants , terrorists , and militaries the world has ever known . They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for freedom in human history . Members of the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marines , and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped secure America at every turn . Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and exemplary service . We also remember and honor those who laid down their lives in freedom 's defense . These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice for our benefit . On Veterans Day , we remember these heroes for their valor , their loyalty , and their dedication . Their selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom around the world . With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world , the Congress has provided -LRB- 5 U.S.C. 6103 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America 's veterans . NOW , THEREFORE , I , GEORGE W. BUSH , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim November 11 , 2008 , as Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15 , 2008 , as National Veterans Awareness Week . I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers . I call upon Federal , State , and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities in their communities . I invite civic and fraternal organizations , places of worship , schools , businesses , unions , and the media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions and programs . IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October , in the year of our Lord two thousand eight , and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third .

280,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui was convicted Wednesday of attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan in 2008 . The jury found Siddiqui guilty of seven counts , including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers . The Manhattan jury began deliberations Monday afternoon and sent a note shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday saying they had reached a verdict . Siddiqui listened to the verdict without emotion but let out an outburst once the jury was escorted out of the courtroom . `` This is a verdict from Israel , not America , '' she said . `` Anger should be directed to where it belongs . I can testify to this . I have proof . '' Authorities removed her from the courtroom . She will be sentenced May 6 . Siddiqui 's family said she had been unjustly found guilty . `` Today 's verdict is one of many legal errors that allowed the prosecution to build a case against our sister based on hate , rather than fact , '' they said in a statement released through the International Justice Network . `` We believe that as a result , she was denied a fair trial , and today 's verdict must be overturned on appeal . '' Prosecutors said Siddiqui shot at two FBI special agents , a U.S. Army warrant officer , an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18 , 2008 . Authorities said Siddiqui used an officer 's rifle to fire two shots at the personnel , who were hidden from her view by a curtain . She hit no one . The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol , hitting Siddiqui at least once . Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor 's compound in central Afghanistan after finding her with bomb-making instructions , excerpts from the `` Anarchist 's Arsenal , '' papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks , and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars , according to a September 2008 indictment . The indictment said Siddiqui had `` handwritten notes that referred to a ` mass casualty attack ' '' listing several locations in the United States and `` construction of ` dirty bombs . ' '' The notes also `` discussed various ways to attack ` enemies , ' including by destroying reconnaissance drones , using underwater bombs , and using gliders , '' the indictment said . `` Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific ` cells , ' ` attacks ' by certain ` cells , ' and ` enemies , ' '' the indictment said . `` Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training . '' Siddiqui , whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda , was extradited to the United States in August 2008 . Since 2003 , the whereabouts of Siddiqui , an American-educated neuroscientist , had been the source of much speculation . According to Amnesty International , Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi , Pakistan , in March 2003 , shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location . Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi . But in May 2004 , then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members .",What was Aafia convicted of ?,attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan
281,"BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Officials on Monday announced the death of a second child who consumed contaminated milk powder . More than 1,200 others have been sickened , according to China 's Health Ministry . Of that number , 340 infants are hospitalized and 53 are considered to be in serious condition . Government inspectors are testing baby formula around China and plan to release their results on Tuesday , said Li Changjiang , head of the State Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine , according to the Xinhua news agency . The manufacturer , Sanlu Group , has recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of babies developing kidney stones , Xinhua said . Watch what Sanlu has done '' Sanlu , one of China 's leading dairy producers , has also sealed off more than 2,100 tons of contaminated product , and another 700 tons still need to be recalled , the news agency said . It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder , according to China Daily . In 2004 , at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition . The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand , according to the paper . More than 170 other babies were hospitalized as a result of drinking the cheap milk powder . Chinese police have questioned 78 people -- including dairy farmers and milk dealers -- about the most recent contamination , a Chinese official told Xinhua Saturday . Sanlu would not say whether its employees are being investigated , Xinhua said . Testing by Sanlu found tripolycyanamide , also known as melamine , in 700 tons of its product , said Zhao Xinchao , the vice mayor of Shijiazhuang , the news agency reported . Zhao told the news agency that the suspects added water to the milk they sold to Sanlu to make more money , then added the chemical so the diluted milk could still meet standards . Inspectors found the chemical in Sanlu infant formula produced by one of the company 's partner producers in northwest Gansu Province , an official said Sunday . Two of 12 samples randomly selected from the Sanlu milk powder produced by the Haoniu Dairy Company in Jiuquan City tested positive for melamine , said Xian Hui , the vice-governor of Gansu . Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones , urinary tract ulcers , and eye and skin irritation . The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants . Hundreds of Wal-Mart and Carrefour stores in China are pulling the Sanlu milk powder from their shelves , Xinhua said . This episode marks the latest in a string of tainted products produced in China . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled more than 150 brands of cat and dog food last year after finding that some pets became ill or died after eating food tainted with melamine , the same chemical found in the powdered milk . Two Chinese businesses , a U.S. company and top executives of each were indicted by a federal grand jury in February in connection with tainted pet food , which resulted in deaths and serious illnesses in up to thousands of U.S. pets , federal prosecutors said . In October 2007 , regulators and retailers in the United States recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . In November , shipments of the popular toy Aqua Dots were found to have been contaminated with a toxic chemical that turned into a powerful `` date rape '' drug if swallowed , causing some children who ate the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness . And in February , a Maryland candy distributor pulled Pokemon-brand Valentine lollipops from store shelves after bits of metal were found in the sealed treats , authorities said .

283,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Author John Updike , regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters , died Tuesday , his publicist said . He was 76 . John Updike won many literary awards . His books , such as `` The Witches of Eastwick , '' were also best-sellers . Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer . He lived in Beverly Farms , Massachusetts . `` He was one of our greatest writers , and he will be sorely missed , '' said Nicholas Latimer , vice president of publicity at Updike 's publisher , Alfred A. Knopf . Updike was a rarity among American writers : a much-esteemed , prize-winning author whose books -- including `` Rabbit , Run '' -LRB- 1960 -RRB- , `` Couples '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` Terrorist '' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- -- were also best-sellers . Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice : for `` Rabbit Is Rich '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- and its successor , `` Rabbit at Rest '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . iReport : Share your tributes to John Updike The `` Rabbit '' series , about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike 's hometown of Shillington , Pennsylvania , spanned four novels , a novella and four decades . In the books -- which also included 1971 's `` Rabbit Redux '' and a 2001 novella , `` Rabbit Remembered '' -- onetime basketball star Harry `` Rabbit '' Angstrom negotiates marriage , divorce , wealth and health problems , never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life . `` Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection , but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood , and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman in naming `` Rabbit , Run '' to Time 's `` All-Time 100 Novels '' list . Updike was incredibly prolific , penning essays , reviews , short stories , poetry and memoirs . His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker , including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams ' final game , `` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu . '' `` No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John , '' said David Remnick , the editor of the magazine , in a statement . `` Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine , loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young . `` We adored him , '' Remnick continued . `` He was , for so long , the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him . '' The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years , including 327 book reviews , 170 short stories and 154 poems . He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts . `` John Updike 's place among America 's literary greats is forever secure , as is his special place in every Red Sox fan 's heart for his magnificent ` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu , ' '' Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D-Massachusetts -RRB- said in a statement . `` We honor his memory and his contributions , and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own . '' Updike never won a Nobel Prize , but one of his characters , Henry Bech , received one in `` Bech at Bay '' -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . His works , particularly given their sexual content , could be as divisive as they were poetic . Many critics accused him of misogyny , and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream . `` It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book , '' the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001 . But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers , the cover of Time magazine -LRB- for 1968 's `` Couples '' -RRB- and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain 's Literary Review . He was criticized by Norman Mailer , hailed by fellow author -LRB- and Updike obsessive -RRB- Nicholson Baker in `` U and I '' and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a `` Simpsons '' episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book . '' -LSB- I -RSB- was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield , '' Updike said , noting that the hardest part of his performance was `` producing a chuckle . '' John Hoyer Updike was born March 18 , 1932 , in Reading , Pennsylvania , and grew up in Shillington . From an early age he took to reading and writing , and earned a full scholarship to Harvard , where he headed the Harvard Lampoon . Upon graduation , he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England . By the time he was 23 , he had been offered a position at The New Yorker , which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years . Updike 's first novel , `` The Poorhouse Fair , '' came out in 1959 . The next year , in `` Rabbit , Run , '' he introduced Angstrom , who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction . When introduced , Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife , the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life . Over the course of the `` Rabbit '' books , the character would routinely infuriate his spouse , mistresses and offspring , try to make things right , and never quite succeed . His attitude did n't help . `` Men are all heart and women are all body . I do n't know who has the brains . God maybe , '' the character said in `` Rabbit , Run . '' `` Rabbit , Run '' was successful , as were Updike 's other '60s books , including `` The Centaur '' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- , which featured a teacher much like Updike 's father , and the short story collection `` The Music School '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . But it was `` Couples '' that made Updike a household name . The book , about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts , became a No. 1 best-seller . Updike 's interests ranged widely . He wrote about an African state in `` The Coup '' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- . He discussed the relationship between science and religion in `` Roger 's Version '' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . He revisited `` Hamlet '' in `` Gertrude and Claudius '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . And he created a group of promiscuous witches in `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil . Though Updike 's work routinely sold well , he was painfully aware of the decline of what 's come to be called `` literary fiction . '' In a 2000 interview with Salon , he lamented its difficulties . `` When I was a boy , the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher 's shelf . I mean , Steinbeck , Hemingway , some Faulkner . Faulkner actually had , considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are , quite a middle-class readership , '' he said . `` But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent . You do n't feel that now . '' And yet , Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word , and the pleasure brought by jotting , tuning , refining -- creating -- a new story , even as the years drifted by . `` An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that , as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them , will outlast him for a while , '' he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year . `` The pleasures , for him , of book-making ... remain , and retain creation 's giddy bliss . Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best . '' Updike 's most recent novel , `` The Widows of Eastwick , '' came out in 2008 . A collection of stories , `` My Father 's Tears and Other Stories , '' is due out later this year .",What prize did John Updike win ?,won the Pulitzer Prize twice
289,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Syrian-born naturalized American was ordered held in custody Wednesday after he was charged for allegedly spying on Syrian protesters in the United States . Judge Theresa Buchanan at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ordered Mohamad Anas Heitham Soueid , 47 , held until Friday , when there will be a detention hearing . Prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick told the judge that Soueid was a flight risk . Soueid , of Leesburg , Virginia , was charged October 5 with conspiring to collect video and audio recordings and other information about people `` in the United States and Syria who were protesting the government of Syria and to provide these materials to Syrian intelligence agencies in order to silence , intimidate and potentially harm the protestors , '' the Justice Department said Wednesday . The Syrian Embassy in Washington responded Wednesday by denying the allegations , saying Soueid never worked for the Syrian government to spy on protesters . Soueid was arrested Tuesday after a federal grand jury charged him in a six-count indictment . He is charged with conspiring to act and acting as an agent of the Syrian government in the United States without notifying the attorney general as required by law ; two counts of providing false statements on a firearms purchase form ; and two counts of providing false statements to federal law enforcement , the Justice Department said . This comes amid Syria 's seven-month-long crackdown against protesters . `` Today 's indictment alleges that the defendant acted as an unregistered agent of the Syrian government as part of an effort to collect information on people in this country protesting the Syrian government crackdown . I applaud the many agents , analysts and prosecutors who helped bring about today 's case , '' said Lisa Monaco , assistant attorney general for national security . The indictment says Soueid has been an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat , a reference to Syrian intelligence agencies . `` At no time while acting as an agent of the government of Syria in this country did Soueid provide prior notification to the Attorney General as required by law , the indictment alleges , '' the Justice Department said . `` Under the direction and control of Syrian officials , Soueid is accused of recruiting individuals living in the United States to collect information on and make audio and video recordings of protests against the Syrian regime -- including recordings of conversations with individual protesters -- in the United States and Syria . He is also charged with providing the recordings and other information to individuals working for the Mukhabarat . According to the indictment , Soueid and others conspired to use this information to undermine , silence , intimidate and potentially harm those in the United States and Syria who engaged in the protests . '' In late June , the Syrian government paid for Soueid to travel to Syria . He met with intelligence officials and privately spoke with President Bashar al-Assad , the indictment said . `` In addition to the recordings , Soueid is accused of providing the Mukhabarat contact information , including phone numbers and e-mail addresses , for protesters in the United States . In a handwritten letter sent to UCC-1 -LRB- an unindicted co-conspirator -RRB- , Soueid allegedly expressed his belief that violence against protesters -- including raiding their homes -- was justified and that any method should be used to deal with the protesters . The indictment also alleges that Soueid provided information regarding U.S. protesters against the Syrian regime to an individual who worked at the Syrian Embassy in Washington , D.C. '' In a statement , the Syrian Embassy challenged the Justice Department to provide evidence of the allegations . It said Soueid is not an agent of any Syrian institution and has never worked for any Syrian official . The allegation that any U.S. citizen is working with Syria to intimidate other U.S. citizens is `` absolutely baseless and totally unacceptable , '' the embassy said . Syria never paid Soueid for travel or any other expense , the embassy said . It also denied there had ever been a private meeting between Soueid and al-Assad , calling it a `` ludicrous '' accusation . It also said the embassy had never recruited anyone to inform on any activities in the United States . `` Contrary to the statement of the Department of Justice , Mr. Soueid has never provided any individual at the Syrian Embassy in the U.S. with any information regarding U.S. protesters or otherwise , '' it said . `` This is a flagrant effort to defame the Embassy of Syria based on sheer lies and fabrications . '' The indictment also said FBI agents interviewed Soueid and he is accused of lying `` when he denied that he had collected information on U.S. persons and transmitted that information to the government of Syria . '' `` In addition , Soueid allegedly made further false statements when he denied to FBI agents that he had directed someone to audio or videotape a conversation , meeting , rally or protest , or that he was aware of any individual taking photographs or videotaping people . He also allegedly made false statements when he denied that he had ever been an agent of the Syrian government or a foreign intelligence officer . '' `` The ability to assemble and protest is a cherished right in the United States , and it 's troubling that a U.S. citizen from Leesburg is accused of working with the Syrian government to identify and intimidate those who exercise that right , '' said Neil MacBride , U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia . `` Spying for another country is a serious threat to our national security , especially when it threatens the ability of U.S. citizens to engage in political speech within our own borders . '' If Soueid is convicted , he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison . Soueid is also known as Anas Alswaid , the Justice Department said . Alswaid had been named in a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Syrian citizens or Syrian-Americans who say they have been subjected to abuse or are family members of those who have been abused by the defendants . Along with Alswaid , the defendants include the Syrian Arab Republic , the Ministry of State Security Intelligence , al-Assad 's brother Maher , the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. , Imad Moustapha , and others . The suit was filed in May . `` Alswaid is an integral part of the criminal conspiracy to torture , maim , and kill Syrians . Through his efforts , the al-Assad regime learns the identities of Syrians based in the United States , who are trying to assist in the efforts to counteract the tactics of the al-Assad regime . He transmits such information to Damascus to initiate criminal conduct against the families of the identified Syrians , '' the suit alleges .

290,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elvis Presley may have left the building three decades ago , but he raked in more money last year than many living titans of the music industry Singer Elvis Presley tops the Forbes list for the second year in a row , raking in $ 52 million last year . For the second year in a row , Presley topped the Forbes magazine 's list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities , hauling in $ 52 million last year . In comparison , the very-much-alive Justin Timberlake earned $ 44 million while another superstar , Madonna , made $ 40 million , the magazine reported Tuesday . The 30th anniversary of Presley 's death boosted attendance and merchandise sales last year at his Memphis , Tennessee , home , Graceland . A long list of licensing deals , such as a Presley show on satellite radio , added to the earnings . The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities ' earnings since 2001 . Since 2003 , the feature has coincided with Halloween . This year , the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $ 194 million in the last 12 months . The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities ' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008 . Some celebrities are staples on the list , which is in its eighth year . Cartoonist Charles Schulz , who created Snoopy , Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of `` Peanuts '' characters , is second on the list . Schulz , who died in 2000 , had posthumous earnings last year of $ 33 million , the magazine reported . He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters , the magazine said . Schulz and Presley join Theodor `` Dr. Seuss '' Geisel -LRB- this year 's No. 6 -RRB- , Beatles legend John Lennon -LRB- No. 7 -RRB- and actress Marilyn Monroe -LRB- No. 9 -RRB- as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception . Physicist Albert Einstein , best known for his theory of relativity , is fourth on the list . It is his third consecutive year making the Forbes rankings . Though he died in 1955 , a franchise bearing his name -- Baby Einstein -- made big bucks last year selling educational books , DVDs , CDs , toys and other products . It plans to expand into the young-adult market this year . Australian actor Heath Ledger , who died of an overdose in January , made his debut on the list in third place . The magazine estimated his earnings at $ 20 million , thanks to the success of the movie , `` The Dark Knight , '' in which Ledger played the Joker . The movie grossed $ 991 million worldwide . Paul Newman , who died of lung cancer last month , also made his first appearance on the list , raking in $ 5 million . `` His income still largely stems from residuals from his classic pictures , as well as more recent productions , '' the magazine said . The legendary actor 's line of natural and organic food products , Newman 's Own , earned revenues of $ 120 million last year , but the earnings were not considered in the tally because Newman donated all profits to charity while he was living , the magazine said . Several entertainers from last year 's list failed to make this year 's cut , including composer , producer and Beatles guitarist George Harrison , rapper/actor Tupac Shakur , `` Godfather of Soul '' James Brown , and reggae legend Bob Marley .",What cartoonist remains relevant with kids ?,Charles Schulz
293,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An al Qaeda suspect alleged to have been involved in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania that killed 11 people faces war crimes charges , the Pentagon announced Monday . Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani is shown in a photo posted by the FBI in 2004 . The bombing in Dar es Salaam , which also wounded hundreds , was one of two carried out nearly simultaneously on August 7 , 1998 . One in Nairobi , Kenya , killed 213 people . Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , from Tanzania , faces nine charges , six of them offenses that could carry the death penalty if he is convicted by a military tribunal . He was captured by Pakistan in 2004 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . In a written announcement , the Pentagon said Ghailani is `` charged with the following substantive offenses : murder in violation of the Law of War , murder of protected persons , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and terrorism . In addition , he is charged with conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses . `` Ghailani is further charged with providing material support to terrorism . This charge alleges that after the bombing , Ghailani continued in his service to al Qaeda as a document forger , physical trainer at an al Qaeda training camp , and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden . '' The charges say he purchased bomb components , scouted the embassy with the suicide bomb driver , met with co-conspirators , and fled to Karachi , Pakistan , one day before the bombing . The convening authority for military commissions , Susan J. Crawford , will determine whether probable cause exists for a trial by military commission , said Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartman of the Office of Military Commissions . For Ghailani to ultimately be sentenced to death , the 12-member jury would have to unanimously find him guilty , determine that aggravating factors apply , and concur on the death sentence , Hartman told reporters at the Pentagon . `` Everything has to be unanimous . '' `` And then there are four levels of post-trial review , which is an extraordinary set of rights available , '' he said . In December , 1998 -- a few months after the embassy bombings -- Ghailani and three other fugitives were indicted in U.S. District Court in New York . It is not known whether he may ultimately face a federal trial . E-mail to a friend",when U.S. Embassy in Kenya bombed almost same time ?,"August 7 , 1998"

297,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Participation in government health insurance programs -- particularly those aimed at children -- increased from 2006 to 2007 , leading to a decrease in the number of Americans lacking insurance , the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday . The Census Bureau says 15.3 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in 2007 . Overall , 45.7 million people , or 15.3 percent of U.S. residents , did not have health insurance in 2007 , the bureau said in releasing reports on poverty , income and insurance . That represents a decrease from the 2006 level of 47 million , or 15.8 percent . The decrease came as a surprise , as the number of uninsured Americans had been expected to rise for a seventh straight year . It also gives a boost to proponents of expanding government health-care plans such as the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP . In December , President Bush signed legislation that extends SCHIP federal funding through the end of March 2009 . That action came after Bush vetoed two congressional attempts to expand the program . In vetoing one of the measures , Bush said the proposed expansion `` moves our country 's health-care system in the wrong direction . '' The percentages of people covered by private health insurance and by employment-based health insurance both decreased slightly in 2007 , the Census numbers showed , although the number of those covered by employment-based insurance , 177.4 million , was not statistically different from 2006 . However , the percentage of people , including children , covered by government health insurance programs increased to 27.8 percent in 2007 from 27 percent in 2006 . The number of children under 18 without health insurance fell to 11 percent , or 8.1 million -- lower than the 2006 numbers of 11.1 percent and 8.7 million . See a state-by-state breakdown of uninsured Americans '' Meanwhile , participation in Medicaid , the government insurance program for low-income Americans , increased to 13.2 percent and 39.6 million in 2007 , up from 12.9 percent and 38.3 million in 2006 . Using a three-year average from 2005-2007 , data showed that Texas had the highest percentage of uninsured , with 24.4 percent , the bureau said . With 8.3 percent , Massachusetts and Hawaii had the lowest estimates for uninsured rates , according to the Census Bureau , but the two were not statistically different from Minnesota -LRB- 8.5 percent -RRB- , Wisconsin -LRB- 8.8 percent -RRB- and Iowa -LRB- 9.4 percent -RRB- . Hawaii also did not differ statistically from Maine -LRB- 9.5 percent -RRB- , it said . But `` even with the overall drop in uninsured Americans , the 45.7 million uninsured number for 2007 exceeds the combined population of 24 states plus the District of Columbia , '' a group called Families USA said in a written statement . The group says on its Web site it is `` dedicated to the achievement of high-quality , affordable health care for all Americans . '' Being uninsured is a stark reality many Americans live with daily . They include Linda Pendleton of Greensboro , North Carolina . Pendleton was unable to afford private coverage when the convenience store where she worked stopped offering insurance to its employees two years ago . It worked out fine , she said , until she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer last month . Unable to work , she moved in with her daughter and her three grandsons . She has applied for Medicaid and disability , but has yet to receive a response . `` So right now I 'm trying to pay for everything , '' said her daughter , Randi Sharp . But that 's not easy . With two of her sons disabled , Sharp stays at home to care for them . Her eldest son receives disability payments of $ 632 per month , which supports the family , she said . The father of Sharp 's children is supposed to pay support , but `` he up and left and the court ca n't find him . '' Though her monthly rent is $ 600 , Sharp said her landlord has cut her some slack . And she goes to churches for her food and did n't buy her sons school clothes this year , she said . Meanwhile , her mother is so dragged down by her reaction to the chemotherapy that she `` can barely do things for herself , '' Sharp said . And even relatively modest fees threaten to cut short her mother 's chemotherapy treatments . `` If I do n't give them cash on Thursday , if I do n't give them $ 70 , they 're not going to see her any more , '' Sharp said . A yard sale over the weekend and trips to the pawn shop have helped . So does cutting back on food . `` There are days I go without even eating for two or three days , '' she said . `` I 've exhausted all of our resources . '' And while the number of those living without health insurance is down , one economist points out , `` we 're still seeing an unraveling of the private health insurance system . '' Overall , insurance premiums have continued to rise faster than wages or inflation , putting the squeeze on companies and on individual families , said Elise Gould , an economist at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute . With 2007 being an economic peak year , `` you 'd think some of the economy would have helped our workers , '' she said . `` We 're not seeing that . '' Another underlying problem , she said , is that people purchase cheaper insurance but often have substandard coverage -- something they often do n't find out until they experience a health-care emergency and must pay a large amount out of pocket . Ron Pollack , executive director of Washington-based Families USA , issued a statement saying , `` It is ironic that , at the very time the Bush administration tried to cut back Medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend children 's health coverage , the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer-sponsored health coverage . It demonstrates the importance that the next president should protect , and not undermine , the public health safety net . '' Although the uninsured rate for children living below the federal poverty level decreased to 17.6 percent in 2007 from 19.3 percent in 2006 , children in poverty were more likely to be uninsured than all children , the Census numbers showed . Still , the numbers of uninsured children decreased across all ethnic groups . However , people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as `` uninsured '' by the Census Bureau , meaning the actual number could be higher . In other data , the real median household income increased 1.3 percent nationwide , reaching $ 50,233 , the Census Bureau said . The official poverty rate remained statistically unchanged , although the number slightly increased -- 37.3 Americans lived below the poverty level in 2007 , up from 36.5 million in 2006 . African-American households had the lowest median income , with $ 33,916 , compared with $ 54,920 for non-Hispanic white households , the data showed . The median income for Hispanic households was $ 38,679 . Household income rose in the Midwest and South , declined in the Northeast and remained unchanged in the West , the bureau said . As defined by the Office of Management and Budget and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index , the Census Bureau put the weighted average poverty threshold for 2007 at $ 21,203 for a family of four ; $ 26,530 for a family of three ; $ 13,540 for a family of two ; and $ 10,590 for individuals . Working women earned 78 percent of the corresponding male salaries , according to the bureau . Median earnings increased for both men and women following three years of decline .

299,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , has died at age 93 , according to his family . Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam . McNamara was a member of Kennedy 's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war . But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam , overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops . Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed `` McNamara 's War , '' he later said both administrations were `` terribly wrong '' to have pursued military action beyond 1963 . `` External military force can not reconstruct a failed state , and Vietnam , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the `` Cold War '' documentary series . `` We did n't recognize it as such . '' A native of San Francisco , McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master 's degree in business from Harvard . He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II , when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency . After the war , he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family . A month later , the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the `` whiz kids '' who joined the young president 's administration . In October 1962 , after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba , McNamara was one of Kennedy 's top advisers in the standoff that followed . The United States imposed a naval `` quarantine '' on Cuba , a Soviet ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion . The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba , a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people . In the 2003 documentary `` The Fog of War , '' McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to `` put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes . '' But he added , `` In the end , we lucked out . It was luck that prevented nuclear war . '' McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon , computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military 's vast purchasing and personnel system . And in Vietnam , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war . Metrics such as use of `` body counts '' and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict . McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand . He , Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia . But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union , which backed communist North Vietnam , McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon . `` The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , '' he told CNN . Casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war . In 1965 , a Quaker anti-war protester , Norman Morrison , set himself on fire outside McNamara 's office window . In 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon , which was ringed with troops . By November 1967 , McNamara told Johnson that there was `` no reasonable way '' to end the war quickly , and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon . By the end of that month , Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank . But by March 1968 , Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara . He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election . After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968 , McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank . He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir , `` In Retrospect . '' `` You do n't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear , '' he told Morris . `` A lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me . A lot of people think I 'm a son of a bitch . ''",Who was the key architect of war in Vietnam under two presidents ?,U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara
301,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Texas grand jury indicted polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs on sexual assault charges , and five of his followers also face a variety of charges , state Attorney General Greg Abbott said . Members of the polygamous FLDS revere jailed leader Warren Jeffs as their prophet . Jeffs was charged in the Tuesday indictment with sexual assault of a child , a first-degree felony . A conviction on the charge could mean a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $ 10,000 , said Dirk Fillpot , a spokesman for the attorney general . Jeffs , 52 , is the so-called leader and `` prophet '' of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , which broke off from mainstream Mormonism in the 1890s over the practice of polygamy . The FLDS openly practices polygamy at its Yearning for Zion Ranch outside Eldorado , Texas , and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line : Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona . Jeffs is accused in the indictment of assaulting a child `` younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant '' in January 2005 . The alleged victim , whose name is redacted on the document , `` was a person who the defendant was prohibited from marrying or purporting to marry or with whom the defendant was prohibited from living under the appearance of being married '' under Texas law . The indictments , which were handed down by a grand jury in San Angelo , Texas , also charge four of Jeffs ' followers with single counts of sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 17 . One of the four also faces a count of bigamy . A fifth follower is charged with three counts of failure to report child abuse . The Texas attorney general 's office was cooperating with other agencies to ensure the five others would be taken into custody , Fillpot said . Their names have not been made public , and only Jeffs ' indictment has been released . Jeffs has been in custody since August 2006 , when he was arrested during a routine traffic stop after spending several months on the FBI 's 10 most wanted fugitives list . Jeffs is serving two consecutive sentences of five years to life in prison on accomplice to rape charges in Utah for his role in the marriage of a sect member to his 14-year-old cousin . He is being held Arizona while he awaits trial on similar charges . It was not immediately clear when Jeffs would be brought to Texas . Authorities seized more than 400 children in April during a raid on the Texas ranch . The children were returned to their families after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children and lacked evidence to show they faced imminent danger of abuse . In May , DNA samples were taken from Jeffs as part of a criminal investigation into allegations that he `` spiritually '' married four girls ranging in age from 12 to 15 , authorities said . A search warrant seeking the DNA samples said marital records -- known as bishop 's records -- from the ranch show that Jeffs married a 14-year-old girl on January 18 , 2004 , in Utah . The records showed that Jeffs `` married '' two 12-year-olds and a 14-year-old at the YFZ Ranch , according to the search warrant . One of the 12-year-olds , believed to have married Jeffs on July 27 , 2006 , was sexually assaulted by Jeffs later that day , the search warrant said . The warrant made reference to pictures of Jeffs with his alleged underage brides . In one photograph , the warrant states , he is kissing one of the 12-year-olds . In another , he is shown with a 15-year-old wife at the birth of their child in October 2004 . Authorities had said the DNA samples would determine whether he is the father of the children born to underage mothers . FLDS spokesman Rod Parker , who is vacationing in Colorado this week , had no immediate comment on the indictment Tuesday . `` As far as an indictment of Warren Jeffs , I 'd want to know a little more before I start talking about it , '' he said . On Thursday , the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is planning to hold a hearing on polygamy and the need for a `` coordinated state and federal response , '' according to an agenda . Carolyn Jessop , a former FLDS member who recently wrote a book about leaving her marriage and the sect , is scheduled to testify , along with federal prosecutors , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and the attorneys general of Texas and Arizona .",What type of crime is sexual assault of a child ?,a first-degree felony
303,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Juventus are back on top of the Italian Serie A table after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Palermo on Sunday maintained their unbeaten start to the season . Goals from Simone Pepe , Alessandro Matri and Claudio Marchisio put Juve ahead of Lazio , who drew 0-0 at Napoli on Saturday , on goal difference -- with Antonio Conte 's side also having a vital game in hand . Pepe opened the scoring in the 20th minute when he was left unmarked to head home Giorgio Chiellini 's cross . Andrea Pirlo then hit the post with a curling effort before Matri doubled the advantage three minutes into the second half when finishing from a tight angle . And the points were sealed in the 65th minute when Marchisio netted from close range after a smart dummy from Matri deceived the Palermo defense . Although Juventus are back on top of the table , the race for this year 's Scudetto promises to be the tightest for years with just one point separating the top four teams . Champions AC Milan are third , a point behind the top two , after their goalless draw at Fiorentina on Saturday , while former leaders Udinese are now in fourth place -- level on points with Milan -- after losing 2-0 at Parma . A Jonathan Biabiany header and a Sebastian Giovinco penalty gave Parma a victory that lifted them up to ninth place in the table .

304,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attacks in January and February by Sudanese forces on Darfur villagers are described in a U.N. report as `` violations of international humanitarian and human rights law . '' Between January and February , Sudanese forces killed 115 people -- including women , children and elderly -- in air and ground attacks on four Darfur villages , according to the report . Prepared by the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur , the report says attacks in January and February point to a deliberate plan to destroy civilian infrastructure . Helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft targeted the villages while armed militias rode in on horses and camels to force about 30,000 people from their homes , according to the report . The attacks were `` carried out during a major military push by the Sudanese government to regain control of West Darfur 's northern corridor , and drive out an insurgent group , '' it said . The village of Saraf Jidad , Sudan , was attacked three times in January , while the villages of Sirbal , Silea and Abu Suruj were attacked within hours of each other on February 8 , UNAMID said in the report . The militias and the Sudanese armed forces looted , vandalized and burned homes , schools , shops , community centers and other buildings in the villages , the report said . Sometimes , buildings were burned with people inside , it said . The attacks `` amount to violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , '' they said . `` The scale of destruction of civilian property , including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population , suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy . '' The Sudanese government had no immediate response . However , last week , Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir accused the international media of `` exaggerating '' the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and Somalia . He said the crisis in Darfur is a `` media fabrication '' and that in most of the region there is little or no conflict and people are living normal lives , he said . Citing Sudanese government statistics , el-Bashir said fewer than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and fewer than 500,000 have been displaced . International figures , including U.N. data , put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced . The conflict began five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government . Sudan 's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed , which have allegedly committed the worst atrocities against Darfur 's local communities . Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the United Nations of widespread human rights abuses . El-Bashir rejects claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines . At the start of this year , more than 9,000 UNAMID peacekeeping troops were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering . Plans are for the force to eventually number 26,000 . E-mail to a friend",Where were the 115 people killed ?,Darfur villages
308,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in the death of a 20-year-old pregnant Marine will be returned to North Carolina to face charges in her slaying , a Mexican judge ruled Thursday , according to North Carolina authorities . U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean was arrested in Mexico in April . U.S. Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , 21 , who was arrested in Mexico in April , could be returned to Onslow County , North Carolina , within a week , the county sheriff 's office said in a statement issued Thursday . Federal authorities will handle his transportation to the North Carolina jail . Laurean has been indicted on first-degree murder and other charges in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach . Her charred body and that of her fetus were found beneath a fire pit in Laurean 's backyard near Camp Lejeune , where both were stationed , in January , a month after she was last seen . Prosecutors allege that Laurean killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico to avoid prosecution . Laurean was arrested in April in San Juan Vina , in the Mexican state of Michoacan . Because he holds citizenship in the United States and Mexico , he could not be immediately deported and had to go through the extradition process , authorities said . Asked by a Mexican reporter at the time of his arrest whether he killed Lauterbach , Laurean said , `` I loved her . '' As part of the effort to apprehend Laurean , authorities seized a computer belonging to his sister-in-law that Laurean 's wife , Christina , was using to communicate with him , a law enforcement official had said . If convicted , Onslow County prosecutors said , Laurean would face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole . Mexico 's extradition policy prohibits U.S. authorities from seeking the death penalty against fugitives it hands over . Authorities found Lauterbach 's body after Christina Laurean produced a note her husband had written claiming that the 20-year-old woman slit her own throat during an argument , according to officials . Although a gaping 4-inch wound was found on the left side of Lauterbach 's neck , autopsy results indicate that the wound itself would not have been fatal . Prosecutors have said there was no evidence that Christina Laurean was involved in or aware of Lauterbach 's slaying before she gave the note to authorities . Lauterbach had accused Laurean of raping her , and it is unclear whether he was the father of her fetus , although her relatives have said they believe him to be . He had denied the rape allegation and said he had had no sexual contact with her . Mary Lauterbach , the young woman 's mother , has said she 's unconvinced that the Marine Corps took her daughter 's rape allegation and other allegations of `` harassment '' seriously . Her daughter 's car was keyed , she said , and she was assaulted . `` Those particular actions should have been taken much more seriously because the Marines were aware of them , '' she said Friday . In a statement issued after her death , the Marine Corps said Laurean 's denial `` was believed to be significant evidence . ''",Where would Laurean be tried ?,"Onslow County , North Carolina"
314,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Kingdom votes on a new government May 6 through a political system that dates back centuries . When does an election happen ? The UK has no written constitution . Instead the country 's electoral system is based on a series of parliamentary acts dating back to the 17th century , when men wore the sort of tights and wigs still donned on ceremonial occasions by some officials of the Houses of Parliament . A general election is when voters nationwide choose lawmakers who will sit in the House of Commons , the lower chamber which initiates and approves legislation . An election must take place , by law , at least every five years . That said , governments can call an election at any time during their term . They could also be forced into an election if they lose a majority of lawmakers in the Commons . Who calls an election ? The starting gun in a general election is traditionally fired when the prime minister travels to Buckingham Palace to ask the queen , the UK 's head of state , to dissolve parliament by royal proclamation . An election must then take place within weeks . Since 1979 , elections have been held between April and June . It is customary for an election to be held on a Thursday . The vote is conducted through the `` first past the post '' system whereby the candidate in each constituency with the most votes wins the seat . If the queen is the head of state , then how come the UK a democracy ? Although the UK is a monarchy , the powers of the reigning head of state have gradually dwindled since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians . Today , the monarch 's role is largely ceremonial and mostly restricted to state functions and appearing on stamps and banknotes . But the monarch still retains formal powers and opens parliament each year . How does parliament function ? The job of parliament is to make laws , scrutinize the actions of the government and debate issues of the day . The Commons -- which has green benches -- currently consists of 650 directly elected lawmakers known as Members of Parliament or MPs who each represent a geographical constituency . The upper house , the Lords -- which has red benches -- is mostly appointed by the government with members serving for life . Its main duty is to vote on legislation passed by the Commons and , when necessary , to send it back for further debate . In certain circumstances the government can force through legislation passed by the Commons but rejected by the Lords . How is an election decided ? Voters do not elect the prime minister , or head of government , directly . Rather , they vote to elect a candidate representing a particular party to serve as their local MP . The leader of the party which wins the most seats is then asked by the Queen to form a government . The leader of the second largest party in the Commons becomes the `` Leader of Her Majesty 's Opposition . '' MPs are elected by a plurality , rather than a majority , of votes . This means that a party can win a majority of seats in the Commons without achieving an overall majority in the overall popular vote . In fact , because there are three main parties in the UK it is extremely rare for a party to win an outright majority . The last prime minister elected by an outright majority was Stanley Baldwin , the Conservative Party leader , in 1931 . In 2005 , Tony Blair 's Labour Party won just 35 percent of the vote but still controlled a 66-seat majority in the House of Commons . So who can I vote for ? For most of the past century , British politics has been dominated by two parties , the left-wing Labour Party and the right-wing Conservative Party . That said , the boundaries between left and right have been blurred as each has strived to occupy the strategically important center ground . A third party , the centrist Liberal Democrats , usually picks up around 20 percent of votes but wins far fewer seats because it is squeezed between the two main parties . Parties from Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland also send small numbers of lawmakers to Westminster . Full guide to UK political parties What happens if a party does n't win a majority of seats ? If no party wins an overall majority -- a `` hung parliament '' -- then the leader of the party which takes the most seats will usually be invited by the monarch to form a government . But its powers will be limited because it can not control a majority of votes in the Commons . The party will usually call another election within months in a fresh attempt to secure a majority . What would a hung parliament mean in 2010 ? The last time this happened was in 1974 , when an election in February resulted in a hung parliament . A second election followed in October of the same year . Many opinion pollsters and observers believe that the 2010 general election will result in a hung parliament .",When did the power of the monarchy begin dwindling ?,since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians

320,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma , heiress and socialite Martha `` Sunny '' von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home , according to a family statement . She was 76 . Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg . Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s . Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma . He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal . He was acquitted in a second trial . His retrial in 1985 received national attention . `` We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , '' said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie `` Ala '' Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman . `` She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members . '' Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family . She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $ 75 million , according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com 's Crime Library Web site . In her early years , she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly . She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage , to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria . That marriage produced two children : Alexander and Annie Laurie . The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter , Cosima . On the morning of December 22 , 1980 , family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family 's posh Newport , Rhode Island , home . She never regained consciousness . She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered , according to the Crime Library site . Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar . Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin . The case also led to a major motion picture , `` Reversal of Fortune . '' Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow . Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz , who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction , said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow 's death is `` a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime . We proved overwhelming -LSB- ly -RSB- that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced . We saved his life , but could not save hers . '' Claus von Bulow 's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow 's alcohol use , among other factors , caused her coma . Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England . Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said . The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren . Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham , who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow , filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal . The case was settled out of court in 1987 , according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island . Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife 's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped . The von Bulows ' daughter , Cosima , sided with her father . Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne , who covered the von Bulow case , told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998 .

321,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the same day he was released from a hospital after undergoing a heart procedure , former President Clinton told reporters he has no plans to slow down . `` I have to keep working -- that 's what my life is for , '' he said outside his home in Chappaqua , New York , on Friday . `` You know I was given a good mind , a strong body , a wonderful life and it would be wrong for me not to work . '' `` I even did a couple of miles -LSB- walking -RSB- on the treadmill today , '' he said . On Thursday , Clinton , 63 , underwent a procedure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital 's Columbia campus to implant two stents in a clogged coronary artery . Clinton has `` no evidence of heart attack or damage to his heart , '' and his prognosis is excellent after undergoing the procedure , according to Dr. Allan Schwartz , the hospital 's chief of cardiology . Schwartz said the procedure was `` part of the natural history '' of Clinton 's treatment after his 2004 quadruple bypass surgery and `` not a result of either his lifestyle or diet , both of which have been excellent . '' Have you gone through heart surgery ? Share your story . Clinton called the procedure `` kind of a repair job '' and said he 's `` actually doing very well . '' He said he began feeling tired around Christmas and traveled several times in recent weeks to Europe and Haiti . `` I did n't really notice it until about four days ago when I felt a little bit of pain in my chest , and I thought I had to check it out , '' he said . Earlier Friday , Clinton , the U.N. special envoy for Haiti , issued a statement marking the passing of one month since a massive earthquake devastated the impoverished nation . He also has visited the island nation twice since the earthquake , a fact he noted on Friday . `` I will continue to work with the Haitian government and people , international donors and multilateral organizations , the Haitian Diaspora , NGOs -LSB- nongovernmental organizations -RSB- , and the international business community to fulfill unmet needs , '' Clinton said in the statement , released Friday . `` Haiti still has a chance to escape the chains of the past and the ruins of the earthquake , '' he said . `` But we all will have to do what we can today . '' Clinton said he had helped collect 200,000 donations for Haiti through his partnership with former President George W. Bush -- the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund -- and through the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund , calling those efforts `` especially impressive . '' He said he has helped allocate $ 7 million in relief . The 7.0-magnitude quake of January 12 leveled most of Port-au-Prince , Haiti 's capital , killing more than 212,000 people and injuring 300,000 , according to Haitian government estimates . It left more than a million homeless . Clinton underwent a procedure called angioplasty , the hospital said , in which a balloon catheter is threaded through an artery to the blocked vessel in the heart . When inflated , the balloon opens the vessel and restores blood flow . Many times , a scaffolding-like structure called a stent is left in place to keep the artery open . How stents open arteries President Obama called Clinton on Thursday evening and wished him a speedy recovery so he can continue his work on Haiti and other humanitarian efforts , a senior administration official said . Schwartz said Clinton began experiencing `` pressure or constriction '' in his chest several days ago , episodes he described as `` brief in nature but repetitive . '' An initial electrocardiogram and blood test showed no evidence of heart attack , Schwartz said . Subsequent pictures of Clinton 's arteries revealed that one of the bypass grafts from his 2004 surgery was `` completely blocked , '' prompting the stent procedure , which took about an hour , Schwartz said . Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after the surgery . Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea , and his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , were with him at the hospital Thursday night , Schwartz said . Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East , but her departure has been delayed until Saturday , a senior U.S. official said . Bill Clinton has maintained an active schedule since leaving the White House in 2001 , devoting much of his time to global philanthropic interests and speeches . Friends have expressed concerns that his `` frenetic pace '' was taking a toll on his health , sources told CNN . Clinton maintained that frenetic schedule all the way up to the surgery , said Terry McAuliffe , a longtime Clinton friend and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee . In fact , as doctors were wheeling Clinton into the operating room , Clinton 's phone had to be taken out of his hand , said McAuliffe . `` He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti , '' McAuliffe told CNN Friday morning . `` And I guarantee as soon as he gets back today he 's going to be back on the phone . He 's passionate about helping the folks down there . '' In addition to his trips to Haiti , Clinton attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January . David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst , said Clinton was exhausted and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month . But Schwartz stressed Thursday that Clinton 's lifestyle has nothing to do with his hospitalization . `` He has really toed the line in terms of both diet and exercise , '' Schwartz said , adding that he told Clinton he could be back in the office Monday . Dr. Spencer King , who has not treated Clinton , rejected as outdated suggestions that the former president needs to slow down . `` This is kind of a '50s concept , '' he said Thursday . `` Now we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done . The outlook for people is totally different . '' `` If he slows down , he slows down , '' said King , president of St. Joseph 's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta , Georgia . But he added , `` It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up . '' Clinton 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday . Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery . Schwartz said Thursday that the type of bypass graft used in Clinton 's 2004 surgery `` has a 10 -LSB- percent -RSB- to 20 percent failure rate after five or six years . '' King said Thursday 's stent procedure may not be the end of Clinton 's heart woes . `` The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease , and sometimes it goes on and develops more , '' he said . `` There 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again .

'' Emmy nominee Jon Hamm stars as ad exec Don Draper in `` Mad Men , '' which earned 16 nominations . AMC 's `` Mad Men '' and FX 's `` Damages '' made Emmy history Thursday as the first basic-cable series to be nominated for best drama . The pair , which had made the 10-series Emmy shortlist , have been widely hailed by critics and have received good ratings for basic-cable series -- though `` Damages '' star Glenn Close said she hopes the Emmys help boost the show 's audience . `` We need all the help we can get , '' she told The Associated Press . On the other hand , HBO 's `` The Wire '' -- which concluded its fifth and final season this year -- once again came up empty in the best drama nominations . It did receive one nod , for writing . The series , though much praised and dissected by a hard-core group of fans , has received little recognition from the Emmys , with just one previous nomination -- also for writing -- in 2005 . Check out some of the top Emmy nods this year '' Indeed , HBO has struggled to find a drama to take the place of the much-lauded `` The Sopranos , '' which won best drama last year after a storied run . `` Mad Men , '' which has made AMC into a player , was allegedly turned down by the cable giant , and shows such as the quickly canceled `` John From Cincinnati '' and `` Rome '' have n't had the same impact . On the other hand , `` In Treatment '' received a nomination for Gabriel Byrne 's performance as a therapist , and the network 's comedies , particularly `` Entourage , '' have performed strongly . Moreover , the network 's short-form programming , such as the miniseries `` John Adams '' and the TV movie `` Recount , '' dominated their Emmy categories : `` John Adams '' led all nominees with 23 nominations , and `` Recount , '' about the 2000 presidential election battle , received 11 . `` The network has made up for -LSB- its lack of drama series success -RSB- in other forms , '' Variety TV editor Michael Schneider told CNN . `` It 's still the most nominated network and has the most nominated program .

Among regularly scheduled TV series , `` 30 Rock '' earned 17 nominations and `` Mad Men '' received 16 . The 17 nominations for `` 30 Rock '' were a record number in a single year for a comedy series . Newcomer `` Pushing Daisies , '' the whimsical series on ABC , received 12 nominations . Given that the show only aired nine episodes -- and has n't been on the air in months due to the writers strike -- its recognition was a surprise , Schneider said . `` It was nice that voters still remembered it , '' he said . Along with `` Damages '' and `` Mad Men , '' nominees for best drama include `` Boston Legal , '' `` Dexter , '' `` House '' and `` Lost . '' Comedy series nominees are `` Curb Your Enthusiasm , '' `` Entourage , '' `` The Office , '' `` 30 Rock '' and `` Two and a Half Men .

327,"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn , one automaker announced Thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the United States , potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen . Tesla unveils its Model S sedan , with a base price of $ 57,400 . The manufacturing plant will be in California . Tesla Motors , maker of a high-end electric sports car , says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California . Thursday 's announcement was made in Hawthorne , California , where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $ 49,900 , after a federal tax credit of $ 7,500 . That 's less than half the price of its first model , the Roadster . Started in 2003 and bankrolled by PayPal millionaire Elon Musk , Tesla has attracted investments from the Silicon Valley elite , among them Google founder Larry Page . It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne . That aerospace company , more commonly known as SpaceX , was founded by Musk in 2002 . SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year . That contract , worth $ 1.6 billion , was won over such industry mainstays as Boeing and Lockheed . The promise of a high-performance , all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup 's first model , the Tesla Roadster , a car with the look , speed and price tag -- a steep $ 109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end , high-performance vehicles . Recently though , the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011 . They 've also had to lay off more than 80 workers , which is about 25 percent of the company 's staff . Nonetheless , Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year . That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster ; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly . The company faces many challenges , the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $ 50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid .","Who hopes to make 20,000 sedans ?",Tesla
328,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces additional child sex charges involving two more alleged victims , bringing the total to 10 , according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly . Sandusky was arrested Wednesday and charged with four counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and two counts of unlawful contact with a minor , allegedly involving two men who were boys at the time of the encounters . `` Today 's criminal charges were recommended by a statewide investigating grand jury , based on evidence and testimony that was received following the initial arrest of Sandusky on November 5th , '' Kelly said in a news release . Each count is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and $ 25,000 in fines . The former coach also faces one new count of indecent assault and two counts of endangering a child 's welfare , each punishable by up to seven years behind bars and $ 15,000 in fines . And Sandusky faces a single new count of indecent assault and two counts of corruption of minors . `` As in many of the other cases identified to date , the contact with Sandusky allegedly fit a pattern of ` grooming ' victims , '' Kelly said in the news release . `` Beginning with outings to football games and gifts ; they later included physical contact that escalated to sexual assaults . '' Sandusky , who maintains his innocence , will face a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday . His attorney , Joe Amendola , blamed prosecutors for turning the case into `` a media circus , '' adding that Sandusky would have willingly turned himself in . Sandusky surrendered when he faced the initial charges . Amendola , who learned of the new charges from a CNN producer in his office , said he was unhappy prosecutors did not make sure he was aware of the arrest before the media . `` I had a few words with the prosecutor , '' Amendola told CNN 's Kathleen Johnston . `` What I told them essentially is , if we are going to play hardball , both sides can play and I was a pretty good pitcher in my day . '' `` The question begs to be asked , why would the attorney general 's office decide not to tell me ... and why did they go to his house and take him out in handcuffs ? '' Amendola said . `` I think the answer is self-explanatory . '' Amendola said he expected his client might not be able to post the $ 250,000 bail before Thursday because he did n't have time to make the arrangements . The alleged victims -- identified by authorities as Victim 9 and Victim 10 -- are believed to have encountered Sandusky at The Second Mile charity , a nonprofit organization he founded for underprivileged children . Victim 9 was between 11 and 12 years old when he first met the former coach back in 2004 . Sandusky allegedly gave the boy gifts and money and took him to university football games , according to the grand jury presentment . The alleged victim testified he would make overnight visits to Sandusky 's home and stay in a basement bedroom . He described a pattern of sexual assaults over a period of years , the grand jury said . `` The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help , knowing that Sandusky 's wife was upstairs , but no one ever came to help him , '' the report states . Sandusky allegedly met Victim 10 , then about age 10 , in 1997 after a counselor recommended the boy attend the charity `` because of difficulties in his home life . '' That witness said Sandusky performed oral sex on him and indecently touched him in an outdoor pool on campus , according to the grand jury . A grand jury report made public last month detailed 40 charges of rape and molestation against the former coach in a child sex abuse scandal that , at the time , involved eight alleged victims . Wednesday 's announcement came on the heels of an attorney 's statement on behalf of a 19-year-old man who stepped forward with claims that Sandusky gave him whiskey and sexually abused him , also in 2004 . The man pointed to a single incident at the university 's football building , according to attorney Chuck Schmidt of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . He was 12 at the time and it allegedly occurred while he was staying overnight during Second Mile activities , the attorney said . It is not clear if the man can be identified as Victim 9 . Schmidt says he plans to file a lawsuit against Penn State , the charity and Sandusky in coming weeks . `` He thought he was the only person this had ever happened to and when he found out there were others , that gave him enough courage to come forward , '' he said of his client . The Second Mile , meanwhile , reported Wednesday that it had `` lost significant financial support '' in the wake of the scandal and plans to reduce its staff . `` We at The Second Mile are saddened by the need to make these cutbacks ; however , our foremost concerns reside with the victims of the horrific abuse reported by the Attorney General and with the children we serve , '' the charity said in a written statement . Sandusky , the longtime Penn State defensive coordinator , has said he only `` horsed around '' with the disadvantaged boys in his care . An attorney for some of the alleged victims Monday blasted Sandusky 's recent interview with The New York Times in which he attempted to clarify his relationships with young people . `` If I say , ` No , I 'm not attracted to young boys , ' that 's not the truth , '' Sandusky said , according to the interview published Saturday . `` Because I 'm attracted to young people -- boys , girls . '' His lawyer , who was present at the interview , spoke up at that point to note that Sandusky is `` not sexually '' attracted to them . `` Right . I enjoy -- that 's what I was trying to say -- I enjoy spending time with young people . I enjoy spending time with people , '' Sandusky added . `` I mean , my two favorite groups are the elderly and the young . '' The former coach told the paper that prosecutors had twisted his decades of work with troubled youths as part of his charity .

329,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- William Safire , a onetime speechwriter for President Nixon who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times , has died at age 79 , the newspaper announced Sunday . William Safire died in Maryland following a battle with pancreatic cancer , The New York Times reported . Safire joined the Times as a columnist in 1973 . In addition to his conservative news columns , which he wrote until 2005 , he wrote a language column for the paper 's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death . He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978 . In 2006 , President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest U.S. civilian honor . Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville , Maryland , the newspaper reported . Born in New York in 1929 , Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers , television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University . After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s , he was credited with putting together the 1959 `` kitchen debate '' between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year 's American National Exhibition in Moscow . Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time . `` What I was publicizing was the typical American house , '' he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July . `` It was my kitchen . '' The next year , he went to work for Nixon 's first , unsuccessful presidential bid . He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968 , when the Republican eventually won the White House , and became one of the administration 's top speechwriters . Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew 's denunciation of journalists as `` nattering nabobs of negativism . '' But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973 , when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times . His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a `` congenital liar '' -- held down the right flank of the Times ' op-ed page for more than three decades . He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance , who as President Carter 's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud . Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980 . And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq 's Kurdish population . He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s , when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt , and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , writing that `` nobody came out of this war more nobly '' than the Kurds . Safire also wrote four novels , several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968 . A new edition came out in 2008 . He is survived by his wife , Helene , two children and one grandchild .",What is `` nattering nabobs of Negativism '' ?,Vice President Spiro Agnew 's denunciation of journalists

336,"Miami , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tropical Storm Paula pushed across western Cuba Thursday evening with wind gusts just under hurricane strength in some places , bringing heavy rain and high winds to the island nation , forecasters said . The storm is gradually weakening and is expected to become a tropical depression Friday , the Miami , Florida-based National Hurricane Center said As of 8 p.m. ET , the center of Paula was about 25 miles -LRB- 45 kilometers -RRB- east of Havana , the center said . It was moving east at 14 mph -LRB- 22 kph -RRB- . Paula passed just south of the Cuban capital around 6 p.m. Thursday -- with sustained winds of 41 mph -LRB- 67 kph -RRB- and a gust of 54 mph -LRB- 87 kph -RRB- recorded in Havana -- after making landfall at about noon near Puerto Esperanza . The storm 's maximum sustained winds have weakened to 55 mph -LRB- 90 kph -RRB- , the center said Thursday night , but wind gusts of 68 mph had been recorded earlier near Puerto Esperanza . Stronger gusts were confined to a small area near the storm 's center , the center said . Paula 's tropical storm-force winds have expanded to 70 miles -LRB- 110 km -RRB- outward from the center , altering the landscape of a storm that has been roughly half that size for most of its duration . Forecasters said the storm was likely to stick to an east to east-northeast track , moving across western and central Cuba Thursday night and Friday . The hurricane center said that tropical storm force winds should continue to spread eastward across western and central Cuba Thursday night , primarily along the north coast . The center discontinued an earlier tropical storm watch also was for the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas . Emergency management officials in the Keys said Wednesday they were keeping an eye on the progress of Paula and expected some gusty winds and rain , but no protective actions had been initiated . Forecasters predict the center of Paula will remain south of the Keys . Paula is likely to dump an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain over portions of western and central Cuba over the next two days , the National Hurricane Center said . Total maximum amounts could be 10 inches in some areas . Heavy rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides , forecasters said . The Florida Keys could see between 1 and 2 inches of rain . In addition , a storm surge is forecast to raise water levels by 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba , accompanied by `` large and destructive waves , '' the hurricane center said .",What is the maximum sustained windspeed ?,55 mph -LRB- 90 kph
339,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia said a senior al Qaeda operative tied to several attacks in East Africa was killed Monday in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia . Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan , pictured on the FBI 's Web site , reportedly was tied to al Qaeda 's East Africa operations . Intelligence sources have confirmed to the Somali government that Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan was killed , Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gelle said Tuesday . `` We welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers , and they are unwanted and unwelcome in Somalia , '' Gelle said . Nabhan 's death will have `` a major impact '' on al Qaeda 's operations in the Horn of Africa , according to one regional analyst . U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car Monday in southern Somalia , killing several people , including one they believed was Nabhan , U.S. officials told CNN earlier . Nabhan , 30 , was born in Kenya and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , according to the sources . More than 200 were killed , and 4,000 wounded in those attacks , most of them Kenyans . The United States targeted Nabhan in an airstrike in southern Somalia near the Kenyan border in March 2008 , U.S. officials said at the time . In February 2006 , the FBI announced that Nabhan was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa , Kenya . Ten Kenyans and three Israelis -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside Mombasa 's Paradise Hotel in November 2002 . The bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an Israeli charter jet , which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members . President Obama signed off on Monday 's operation , a senior U.S. official said . The United States had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that Nabhan was in the area , the U.S. officials said . The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on Monday 's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media . The U.S. helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore , while the ship kept watch on the operation , one of the sources said . The warship was ready to rescue the American troops if they got into trouble . Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe , Somalia , said they witnessed the assault . They said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died . The witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter . A U.S. official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification . Nabhan is believed to be an associate of al Qaeda member Harun Fazul , who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies . The U.S. military has long sought Nabhan because he is believed to be deeply involved in al Qaeda 's East African operations , a senior U.S. official said last year . `` He was certainly one of the leading al Qaeda figures in East Africa , '' said Rashid Abdi , a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group , an independent advisory and analysis organization . Nabhan `` has been living in the shadows '' in Somalia and not much is known about his recent activity , Abdi said . `` The fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on al Qaeda than on Al-Shabaab , '' he said , referring to the Islamist militia in Somalia that has ties to al Qaeda . `` He is a man with an important organizational memory , and if a key figure like him is killed , it always has a major impact . '' Al-Shabaab is waging a bloody battle against Somalia 's transitional government and is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations because of its al Qaeda ties . There are growing concerns that Somalia could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan . CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives .

341,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California , Swiss police said Sunday . Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris , France , in June 2009 . Polanski , 76 , was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday , Zurich police said . A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport . He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for `` The Pianist '' in 2003 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl . But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced , and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978 . Watch what happens now for Polanski '' Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for `` Tess '' and `` Chinatown , '' and for best writing for `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' which he also directed . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a Polanski tribute this year , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles , California , after authorities learned Polanski was going to be in Switzerland , Sandi Gibbons , spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , told CNN on Sunday . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put `` in provisional detention . '' But whether he can be extradited to the United States `` can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , '' a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail . `` It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , '' the spokesman wrote . `` Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . '' Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland , but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski 's sentencing process , depending on what happens in Zurich . Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor . There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski 's case was handled years ago . According to court documents , Polanski , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial . But the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . Polanski fled the United States for France , where he was born . In the February hearing , Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send Polanski to prison . `` It 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , '' said Espinoza . But he declined to dismiss the case entirely . Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out . Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Following Espinoza 's ruling earlier this year , Geimer 's lawyer , Larry Silver , said he was disappointed and that Espinoza `` did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption . '' He argued in court that had `` Mr. Polanski been treated fairly '' his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime . Polanski 's arrest Saturday came two days after one of his wife 's killers died . The director 's pregnant wife , actress Sharon Tate , and four others were butchered by members of the Manson `` family '' in August 1969 . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times .

342,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran 's supreme leader took verbal jabs at the United States Saturday in his first public reaction since the United States accused Iran of plotting to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington . Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeled the allegations `` meaningless and absurd . '' `` They -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- want to isolate Iran , '' Khamenei said over chants of `` down with America '' in a speech before thousands in the western Iranian city of Gilangharb . Also , an Iranian official said claims by the United States that a high-level U.S. diplomat had met Wednesday with an Iranian counterpart over the plot were untrue . `` There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries , and there was not such a contact , '' said Alireza Miryousefi , press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations . The United States had reported having had `` direct contact with Iran '' about the alleged plot . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland disclosed the contact to reporters . A senior administration official told CNN it occurred Wednesday and was initiated by the United States . Two State Department officials said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice met with Mohammad Khazai , Iran 's permanent representative to the United Nations . Ahead of Saturday 's rebuttal of the claims of diplomatic contact , Iranian officials had previously declined to confirm the meeting . U.S. authorities have accused Iran of being involved in a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States , Adel Al-Jubeir , in spring 2012 . The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force , a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard , which formally answers to Khamenei . Manssor Arbabsiar , a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen , and Gholam Shakuri , an Iran-based member of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , are accused of conspiring to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to bomb a restaurant , where the ambassador would have been . Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel , according to officials and an FBI agent 's affidavit . Reza Aslan , a religious scholar and author , told CNN on Saturday that the described plot `` just does not fit the Quds Force 's M.O. -LRB- modus operandi -RRB- . '' Using a drug cartel would be risky and a Quds Force agent would be more reliable than Arbabsiar , a used-car salesman in Texas , he said . `` It 's sloppy . It 's uncharacteristic , '' said Aslan . `` It really does not serve Iran 's interest in any legitimate way . '' Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East , Africa and elsewhere , Aslan said . `` Doing so on U.S. soil is unmistakably an attack on the United States , not on Saudi Arabia .

Hurricane Bill is expected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast over the weekend . As of 11 p.m. Friday , Bill 's center was about 180 miles west-southwest of Bermuda , and about 545 miles east-southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . Its forward speed had increased to about 20 mph as it continued moving north-northwest , forecasters said . The storm was expected to gradually turn toward the north late Friday and into Saturday . See Bill 's projected path '' If the storm follows its current track , it should pass over the open water between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast on Saturday , forecasters said . Earlier Friday , Bill 's outer bands began producing rain in Bermuda as the storm neared the British territory , the hurricane center said . Forecasters expect Bill to pelt Bermuda with 1 to 3 inches of rain , although up to 5 inches is possible . iReport.com : Bermuda 's preparations The storm also was beginning to affect the U.S. East Coast , where dangerous rip currents and battering waves were developing , said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras . Rip currents form as wind and waves push water against the shore , where it is caught behind an obstacle such as a sandbar until it breaks free , sending a strong channel of water flowing away from the shoreline . The large swells are expected to affect most of the U.S. East Coast within the next couple of days , the hurricane center said . There were reports of waves at the center of the storm as high as 54 feet , Jeras said . With Bill advancing , the Bermuda Weather Service forecasts the storm tide will raise water levels by as much as 3 feet along the coast and produce large , battering waves . Large swells were affecting Puerto Rico , the island of Hispaniola and the Bahamas to the south , the agency said . Bermuda remained under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch . The warning means winds of at least 39 mph are expected within 24 hours , while the watch indicates winds of at least 74 mph are possible within 36 hours . Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 85 miles from the center and storm-force winds outward as much as 275 miles , the hurricane center said .

A member of the Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007 . The U.N. 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- OCHA -RRB- reported that fighting in Muhajeria and Shearia between Sudanese government forces , and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- , drove over 15,000 people north to the Zam Zam camp . The water supply to the camp is becoming strained with displaced people arriving there every day , OCHA said Wednesday . The government of Sudan has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years , a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide . An estimated 300,000 people in the western Sudanese region have been killed through combat , disease or malnutrition , according to the United Nations . An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels , government forces and the violent Janjaweed militias . Fighting continues in the region despite the JEM and local government signing a `` goodwill and confidence-building '' agreement earlier in February , according to the U.N. .

The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength . Last year , Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government 's campaign of violence in Darfur . Under pressure to end the fighting , Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur .

348,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson , the show-stopping singer whose best-selling albums -- including `` Off the Wall , '' `` Thriller '' and `` Bad '' -- and electrifying stage presence made him one of the most popular artists of all time , died Thursday , CNN has confirmed . Michael Jackson , shown in 2008 , was one of the biggest pop stars in history . He was 50 . He collapsed at his residence in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles , California , about noon Pacific time , suffering cardiac arrest , according to brother Randy Jackson . He died at UCLA Medical Center . Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said an autopsy would probably be done on the singer Friday , with results expected that afternoon . Watch crowds gather at Jackson 's hospital '' `` Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color , '' the Rev. Al Sharpton said . `` To say an ` icon ' would only give these young people in Harlem a fraction of what he was . He was a historic figure that people will measure music and the industry by . '' Jackson 's blazing rise to stardom -- and later fall from grace -- is among the most startling of show business tales . The son of a steelworker , he rose to fame as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , a band he formed with his brothers in the late 1960s . By the late '70s , as a solo artist , he was topping the charts with cuts from `` Off the Wall , '' including `` Rock With You '' and `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . '' Watch Jackson perform at a 1988 concert '' In 1982 , he released `` Thriller , '' an album that eventually produced seven hit singles .

A new Jackson album -- a new Jackson appearance -- was a pop culture event . iReport : Share your memories of Michael Jackson The pop music landscape was changing , however , opening up for rap , hip-hop and what came to be called `` alternative '' -- and Jackson was seen as out of step . His next release , 1991 's `` Dangerous , '' debuted at No. 1 but `` only '' produced one top-ranking single -- `` Black or White '' -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending , in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch . And then `` Dangerous '' was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana 's `` Nevermind , '' an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics . After that , more attention was paid to Jackson 's private life than his music career , which faltered . A 1995 two-CD greatest hits , `` HIStory , '' sold relatively poorly , given the huge expense of Jackson 's recording contract : about 7 million copies , according to Recording Industry of America certifications . A 2001 album of new material , `` Invincible , '' did even worse . In 2005 , he went to trial on child-molestation charges . He was acquitted . In July 2008 , after three years away from the spotlight , Jackson announced a series of concerts at London 's O2 Arena as his `` curtain call . '' Some of the shows , initially scheduled to begin in July , were eventually postponed until 2010 .

'' The group 's first four singles -- `` I Want You Back , '' `` ABC , '' `` The Love You Save '' and `` I 'll Be There '' -- went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart , the first time any group had pulled off that feat . There was even a Jackson 5 cartoon series on ABC . Watch reaction from Motown Studios '' In 1972 , he hit No. 1 as a solo artist with the song `` Ben . '' The group 's popularity waned as the '70s continued , and Michael eventually went solo full time . He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 movie version of `` The Wiz , '' and released the album `` Off the Wall '' in 1979 . Its success paved the way for `` Thriller , '' which eventually became the best-selling album in history , with 50 million copies sold worldwide . At that point , Michael Jackson became ubiquitous . Seven of `` Thriller 's '' nine cuts were released as singles ; all made the Top Ten . The then-new cable channel MTV , criticized for its almost exclusively white playlist , finally started playing Jackson 's videos . They aired incessantly , including a 14-minute minimovie of the title cut . -LRB- `` Weird Al '' Yankovic cemented his own stardom by lampooning Jackson 's song `` Beat It '' with a letter-perfect parody video . -RRB- On the Motown Records ' 25th-anniversary special -- a May 1983 TV extravaganza with notable turns by the Temptations , the Four Tops and Smokey Robinson -- it was Michael Jackson who stopped the show .

But even at the time of the `` Motown 25 '' moonwalk , fame was old hat to Michael Jackson . He had n't even turned 25 himself , but he 'd been a star for more than half his life . He was given the nickname the `` King of Pop '' -- a spin on Elvis Presley 's status as `` the King of Rock 'n' Roll '' -- and few questioned the moniker . Relentless attention But , as the showbiz saying has it , when you 're on top of the world , there 's nowhere to go but down . The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real , some rumored -- as his music .

He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets . Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block . However , an auction of material from Neverland , scheduled for April , was called off and all items returned to Jackson . Interest in Jackson never faded , however , even if some of it was prurient . In 2008 , when he announced 10 comeback shows in London , beginning in July 2009 , the story made worldwide news . The number of concerts was later increased to 50 . Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March .

349,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Author John Updike , regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters , died Tuesday , his publicist said . He was 76 . John Updike won many literary awards . His books , such as '' The Witches of Eastwick , '' were also best-sellers . Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer . He lived in Beverly Farms , Massachusetts . `` He was one of our greatest writers , and he will be sorely missed , '' said Nicholas Latimer , vice president of publicity at Updike 's publisher , Alfred A. Knopf . Updike was a rarity among American writers : a much-esteemed , prize-winning author whose books -- including `` Rabbit , Run '' -LRB- 1960 -RRB- , `` Couples '' -LRB- 1968 -RRB- , `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` Terrorist '' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- -- were also best-sellers . Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice : for `` Rabbit Is Rich '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- and its successor , `` Rabbit at Rest '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . iReport : Share your tributes to John Updike The `` Rabbit '' series , about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike 's hometown of Shillington , Pennsylvania , spanned four novels , a novella and four decades . In the books -- which also included 1971 's `` Rabbit Redux '' and a 2001 novella , `` Rabbit Remembered '' -- onetime basketball star Harry `` Rabbit '' Angstrom negotiates marriage , divorce , wealth and health problems , never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life . `` Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection , but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood , and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman in naming `` Rabbit , Run '' to Time 's `` All-Time 100 Novels '' list . Updike was incredibly prolific , penning essays , reviews , short stories , poetry and memoirs . His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker , including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams ' final game , `` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu . '' `` No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John , '' said David Remnick , the editor of the magazine , in a statement . `` Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine , loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young . `` We adored him , '' Remnick continued . `` He was , for so long , the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him . '' The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years , including 327 book reviews , 170 short stories and 154 poems . He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts . `` John Updike 's place among America 's literary greats is forever secure , as is his special place in every Red Sox fan 's heart for his magnificent ` Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu , ' '' Sen. John Kerry -LRB- D-Massachusetts -RRB- said in a statement . `` We honor his memory and his contributions , and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own . '' Updike never won a Nobel Prize , but one of his characters , Henry Bech , received one in `` Bech at Bay '' -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . His works , particularly given their sexual content , could be as divisive as they were poetic . Many critics accused him of misogyny , and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream . `` It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book , '' the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001 . But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers , the cover of Time magazine -LRB- for 1968 's `` Couples '' -RRB- and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain 's Literary Review . He was criticized by Norman Mailer , hailed by fellow author -LRB- and Updike obsessive -RRB- Nicholson Baker in `` U and I '' and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a `` Simpsons '' episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book . '' -LSB- I -RSB- was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield , '' Updike said , noting that the hardest part of his performance was `` producing a chuckle . '' John Hoyer Updike was born March 18 , 1932 , in Reading , Pennsylvania , and grew up in Shillington . From an early age he took to reading and writing , and earned a full scholarship to Harvard , where he headed the Harvard Lampoon . Upon graduation , he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England . By the time he was 23 , he had been offered a position at The New Yorker , which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years . Updike 's first novel , `` The Poorhouse Fair , '' came out in 1959 . The next year , in `` Rabbit , Run , '' he introduced Angstrom , who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction . When introduced , Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife , the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life . Over the course of the `` Rabbit '' books , the character would routinely infuriate his spouse , mistresses and offspring , try to make things right , and never quite succeed . His attitude did n't help . `` Men are all heart and women are all body . I do n't know who has the brains . God maybe , '' the character said in `` Rabbit , Run . '' `` Rabbit , Run '' was successful , as were Updike 's other '60s books , including `` The Centaur '' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- , which featured a teacher much like Updike 's father , and the short story collection `` The Music School '' -LRB- 1966 -RRB- . But it was `` Couples '' that made Updike a household name . The book , about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts , became a No. 1 best-seller . Updike 's interests ranged widely . He wrote about an African state in `` The Coup '' -LRB- 1978 -RRB- . He discussed the relationship between science and religion in `` Roger 's Version '' -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . He revisited `` Hamlet '' in `` Gertrude and Claudius '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . And he created a group of promiscuous witches in `` The Witches of Eastwick '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil . Though Updike 's work routinely sold well , he was painfully aware of the decline of what 's come to be called `` literary fiction . '' In a 2000 interview with Salon , he lamented its difficulties . `` When I was a boy , the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher 's shelf .

350,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The H1N1 flu virus could cause up to 90,000 U.S. deaths , mainly among children and young adults , if it resurges this fall as expected , according to a report released Monday by a presidential advisory panel . The report urges speedier production of the H1N1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by September . The H1N1 virus , commonly known as swine flu virus , could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the American population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million U.S. hospital admissions , the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported . The report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a `` plausible scenario '' involving large outbreaks at schools , inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective . Up to 40,000 U.S. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year , with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65 . With seasonal flu and H1N1 , this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place `` enormous stress '' on intensive care units nationwide , which normally operate near capacity , the report says . An H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September , at the beginning of the school year , and infections may peak in mid-October , according to the report . However , the H1N1 vaccine is n't expected to be available until mid-October , and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity , the report says . Watch more on H1N1 predictions for this fall '' The potential `` mismatch in timing '' could significantly diminish the usefulness of the H1N1 vaccine , the report says . `` Even with the best efforts , this will cause some illness , some severe illness and unfortunately , some deaths , '' Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Monday . `` But a lot so far has gone remarkably right , '' Frieden said . `` There 's a vaccine well on its way to being distributed , diagnostic tests available in well over 100 laboratories , treatments pre-positioned around the country ... and guidance issued for health care providers , schools , businesses and other communities . '' Among the report 's recommendations are for government agencies to : • Prepare several `` planning scenarios '' to determine demand for supplies and care . • Set up surveillance systems to track information about influenza-like illnesses . • Develop plans to protect the public 's most vulnerable groups , such as pregnant women and those with pre-existing medical conditions . • Speed up the production of the H1N1 vaccine and have an initial batch -- enough to vaccinate up to 40 million people , especially those who are at risk of serious disease -- by mid-September . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the government 's preparation and guidance for the public was based on the need to strike a balance `` on a continuum of being paralyzed with fear versus complacency . '' So far , clinical trials for the H1N1 vaccine have not indicated adverse side effects beyond what are experienced with the seasonal flu vaccine , Sebelius said . However , there would be no formal decision to launch a vaccination campaign until those trials were complete , she said . That decision would be hers , she said , and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary . Pregnant women , health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population , Sebelius has said . Adults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the H1N1 virus . H1N1 preparation guidelines for the nation 's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago . The plans are available at the Web site www.flu.gov . The H1N1 vaccine would require two shots , the second three weeks after the first . Immunity to the virus would not kick in until two weeks after the second shot . The World Health Organization declared the H1N1 virus a global pandemic on June 11 . More than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring , a WHO official said last week .

His career at NBC was marked by a number of milestones . In 1985 , Russert supervised live broadcasts of the `` Today '' show from Rome , Italy , negotiating an appearance by Pope John Paul II -- a first for American television . He was also the recipient of numerous awards for his work , including an Emmy in 2005 for his coverage of the funeral of President Ronald Reagan .

353,"Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States plans to appeal a federal judge 's dismissal of charges against five Blackwater security guards accused of killing 17 people in Baghdad in 2007 , Vice President Joe Biden announced Saturday . Speaking at a joint appearance with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in Baghdad , Biden said he was `` disappointed '' with the ruling , and that the Justice Department would file the appeal next week . `` The United States is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people , '' Biden told reporters . The September 2007 shootout in Baghdad 's Nusoor Square left 17 Iraqis dead and two dozen wounded . The killings led Iraq 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater , now known as Xe , and other firms . An attorney representing one of the five defendants in the case said he was disappointed by Biden 's announcement in Iraq , saying it was motivated by `` political purposes '' as opposed to legal reasoning . `` This is not how the Justice Department announces its intentions in any case , '' said David Schertler , attorney for Dustin Heard . `` We had no idea that the vice president was going to announce a political decision . '' Last month , U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the government 's case was built largely on `` statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution , '' a violation of the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged . `` In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , '' Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision . Federal prosecutors `` repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case '' in doing so , he found . Urbina also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case , calling their explanations for using the guards ' statements `` all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility . '' `` In short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , '' he wrote . Schertler , Heard 's attorney , said Urbina 's `` reasoning is sound and will hold up in appeal . '' The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began . The company said its contractors came under attack , but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate . Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough , Evan Liberty , Dustin Heard , Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime . Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November , but Thursday 's ruling dismisses the counts against all five . `` We 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , '' Slough 's lawyer , Mark Hulkower , said at the time of the dismissal . A sixth guard , Jeremy Ridgeway , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .

354,"What the heck are triglycerides ? If you do n't know , you have plenty of company . One in every three Americans has high triglyceride levels , which elevate risk of heart disease and early death . The fatty particles found in your blood are important for heart health , but do n't get nearly as much attention as , say , cholesterol . Now a new study suggests that there 's a good chance that your triglycerides are in the unhealthy zone , whether you know what they are or not . About one-third of American adults have triglyceride levels that are borderline or too high , according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine . `` I see it as a major problem that we 've completely ignored this problem so far , '' said Dr. Børge Nordestgaard of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark . Nordestgaard has conducted research linking high triglyceride levels to cardiovascular disease and early death , but was not involved in the CDC research . `` Everyone in clinical practice seemed to be so focused on LDL , LDL , LDL -LSB- bad cholesterol -RSB- , people tended to forget triglycerides . '' he said . Being too heavy , getting too little activity , drinking lots of alcohol and eating lots of saturated fat can all add up to higher triglyceride levels because the body stores excess calories as triglycerides . Health.com : Fats to eat , fats to avoid Triglycerides are a third type of fatty particle found in the blood , along with LDL cholesterol and HDL -LRB- also known as good -RRB- cholesterol . People taking certain medications or those who have diabetes or a genetic condition can have high triglycerides . Health.com : What cholesterol tests reveal about your heart 's health Nordestgaard said that high triglycerides are as dangerous as high cholesterol levels as a risk marker for heart disease and early death . `` There 's a really big potential for further prevention of heart disease and strokes by getting more focused on that , '' he said . Health.com : How stress can trigger heart problems The problem : Right now , the best way to attack high triglycerides is by losing weight , eating more healthily , and becoming more active -- a tall order for many of us . In the new report , Dr. Earl Ford of the CDC , and his colleagues looked at a nationally representative group of 5,610 people 20 and older . They found that 33.1 percent had triglyceride levels above 150 milligrams per deciliter , while 17.9 percent had levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter , 1.7 percent had levels of 500 milligrams per deciliter or above , and 0.4 percent had levels higher than 1,000 milligrams per deciliter . Triglycerides of 150 to 199 milligrams per deciliter are considered borderline high and anything above 200 milligrams per deciliter is considered too high . Men were more likely than women to have high triglycerides , while whites were at greater risk than African Americans and Mexican Americans . Very high triglyceride levels can cause inflammation of the pancreas . Although there 's increasing evidence that elevated triglycerides are associated with cardiovascular disease and early death , no one has yet shown that treating high triglyceride levels reduces cardiovascular disease , according to an editorial by Dr. Warren G. Thompson and Dr. Gerald T. Gau of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine , in Rochester , Minnesota . Lifestyle changes -- exercising , losing weight , swapping healthy fats for unhealthy ones , and the like -- are the treatment of choice right now for people with triglyceride levels between 150 milligrams per deciliter and 500 milligrams per deciliter . According to the National Cholesterol Education Panel , higher-risk people with triglyceride levels falling in this range may also need medication . Beyond lifestyle changes , treatments for high triglycerides include statins , fibrates , niacin , and fish oil . But while fibrates reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack , Thompson and Gau note , they do n't reduce mortality and actually increase the risk of death from non-heart-related causes ; they are only recommended for people with triglycerides above 1,000 milligrams per deciliter . `` What we really need scientifically , we need companies to come up with drugs that are more efficient at particularly reducing triglycerides , '' said Nordestgaard .

355,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Sen. Tom Daschle will be announced Thursday as President-elect Barack Obama 's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , a Democratic source said Wednesday . Former Sen. Tom Daschle , shown with his wife , Linda , says he will write Obama 's health care plan . CNN has previously reported that the 61-year-old former Senate majority leader from South Dakota would be Obama 's choice , but not the announcement date . In November , Daschle said he was excited about the possibility of serving as point person in Obama 's effort to change the nation 's health care system . Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama 's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year . `` I hope to have the plan enacted by next year , and then it will take several years to implement , '' Daschle said last month . Daschle said reforming health care in the United States must be a priority in the current economic climate . `` We ca n't afford not to do it , '' he said . `` If we do nothing , we 'll be paying twice as much on health care in 10 years as we do today . '' Daschle served as Democratic leader in the Senate from 1995 until he lost a re-election bid in 2004 . Representing South Dakota , he was first elected as a congressman in 1978 and served in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 1986 . He recently wrote a book on health care titled `` Critical : What We Can Do About the Health Care Crisis . '' In the book , he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare . Most Republicans oppose any such plan , saying it would give too much power to the government . They 've also questioned Daschle 's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm . His wife , Linda Daschle , is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients . But a source close to Daschle told CNN that Linda Daschle would be leaving the firm at the end of the year to set up her own company focusing on transportation lobbying in order to clear any potential conflicts of interest .

357,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama released his long-awaited debt reduction plan Monday , outlining a roughly $ 3 trillion savings blueprint that was immediately criticized by top congressional and other Republicans . The president 's plan includes $ 1.5 trillion in new revenue generated largely by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans , a proposal strongly opposed by GOP leaders who insist that any tax increase will undermine an already shaky economy . The measure -- which would add to nearly $ 1 trillion in savings signed into law under the debt-ceiling deal enacted in August -- does not include changes to Social Security . It would increase Medicare premiums for individuals with higher incomes starting in 2017 -- the year Obama leaves office if he wins a second term . `` We are not going to have a one-sided deal that hurts the folks that are most vulnerable , '' Obama said at the White House , offering a defense of tax hikes on the highest earners . Spending cuts alone `` will not solve our fiscal problems . We ca n't just cut our way out of this hole , '' he added . `` It 's going to take a balanced approach . If we 're going to make spending cuts -- many of which we would n't make if we were n't facing such large budget deficits -- then it 's only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share . '' Obama explicitly promised to veto any debt-reduction legislation that cuts benefits while failing to include higher taxes on the wealthy . iReport : What do you think about Obama 's plan ? `` I will not support any plan that puts all the burden on ordinary Americans , '' he insisted . Republicans responded by dismissing the plan as little more than a cheap political gimmick . It 's `` a thinly veiled attempt to score political points , '' said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus . `` By raising taxes on job creators , Obama may win back some support from disgruntled liberal voters , but America will lose even more sorely needed jobs . '' `` Veto threats , a massive tax hike , phantom savings and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth â $ '' or even meaningful deficit reduction , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky . `` Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership , '' added House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . Key congressional Democrats quickly rallied to Obama 's defense , calling the blueprint a serious attempt to take on one of the most contentious issues in Washington . The `` proposal is clearly moving in the right direction , '' said North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . `` It represents a significant and balanced plan for bringing our deficits and debt under control . '' On Monday night , Obama referred to the Republican response as predictable and said the issue shows the fundamental difference between the parties on how the nation should deal with mounting federal deficits and national debt . `` What has been clear over the last two and a half years is that we have not had a willing partner , '' Obama told a New York fundraising event . `` Now , we 've been able to get some stuff done despite that , and despite a filibuster in the Senate . But at least over the last nine months what we 've seen is some irreconcilable differences , let 's put it that way . '' The release of Obama 's blueprint is likely to set the stage for a fall dominated by harsh partisan debates over taxes and spending , as well as a 2012 presidential campaign focused on growing economic fears . Under Obama 's plan , $ 800 billion in revenue would be generated by allowing some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income households to expire , as the president has repeatedly called for . An additional $ 400 billion would result from capping the value of itemized deductions and other exemptions for high-income households . Read the White House plan -LRB- PDF -RRB- The remaining $ 300 billion would come from closing various tax loopholes , according to a senior administration official . A new tax surcharge could also be imposed on millionaires : the `` Buffett Rule , '' named after investor Warren Buffett , who argues that the richest Americans are not taxed enough . Wealthier Americans often derive much of their income from investments , which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income such as wages . As a result , they can end up owing a lower percentage of their income in federal taxes than someone who makes less money , especially once payroll taxes are factored in . The concept behind the Buffett Rule is that those earning more than $ 1 million should not be allowed to pay a lesser percentage of their income in federal taxes than Americans lower down the income scale . Read more : On taxes and debt , left and right dare to agree In terms of spending , Obama 's plan incorporates $ 580 billion in mandatory cuts , including $ 248 billion from the politically popular Medicare program . Roughly 90 % of those savings will come from reducing overpayments in the system , according to a senior administration official . Any changes to Medicare benefits wo n't kick in before 2017 , the official said . An additional $ 72 billion will come from Medicaid and other health programs . The president 's plan does not include any Social Security reform proposals or changes to the Medicare eligibility age , reforms that have reportedly been put on the table by the administration in the past but are strongly opposed by a number of progressive Democrats . Another $ 1.1 trillion in savings would be generated by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . In addition , the administration is counting savings that would result from spending caps it has proposed on future overseas contingency operations . The administration also estimates interest savings of approximately $ 430 billion , a result of less borrowing and smaller annual budget shortfalls . Roughly $ 450 billion in the plan would be used to pay for the American Jobs Act , the economic stimulus measure proposed by Obama last week . Top Republicans call the president 's plan a form of class warfare . `` When you pick one area of the economy and you say , ` We 're going to tax those people because most people are not those people , ' that 's class warfare , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` We have a difference of opinion on how best to fix these problems , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin , told `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` But when the president does things like this , it leads you to believe that he 's not in bipartisan consensus-making mood . He 's in a political class-warfare mode and campaign mode . And that 's not good for our economy . '' Obama explicitly rejected the class warfare claim Monday . `` I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare , '' the president said . `` I think it 's just the right the thing to do . I believe the American middle class , who 've been pressured relentlessly for decades , believe it 's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations . '' Democrats have blamed Republicans for blocking the Obama administration 's initiatives purely for what Democrats insist are short-term political gain . `` I do n't think people like that style of politics , and that 's the reality ... we 'll be facing in November 2012 , '' Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , said Sunday . Congressional action on deficit reduction is moving on multiple tracks now . Durbin said the Democratic-controlled Senate would take up Obama 's jobs plan next month , while leaders in the Republican-controlled House have rejected some parts of it . Meanwhile , a special deficit reduction commission created under last month 's debt-ceiling agreement has started its work amid the longstanding political divisions on key issues . The 12-member committee , evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate , has until November 23 to draft a $ 1.5 trillion deficit-reduction plan that can win congressional approval by December 23 . Otherwise , more than $ 1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect , on top of $ 900 billion in cuts already mandated under the debt ceiling deal . The special committee `` is taking this issue far more seriously than the White House , '' McConnell said Monday . More than a year of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction has failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise tax revenue while cutting spending . The brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason that ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA-plus in August .

'' Sandusky , 67 , allegedly engaged in fondling , oral and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years , according to an investigative state grand jury 's summary of testimony . He maintains he is innocent . Also named in the state grand jury report are Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley , 57 , and Gary Schultz , 62 , the university 's senior vice president for finance and business . They face one count of perjury each in connection to an alleged cover-up of the abuse . `` If true , the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all Penn Staters . While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved I ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , '' Paterno said in a statement . The legendary coach said an assistant coach told him in 2002 about an `` incident in the shower of our locker room facility . '' `` It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report . Regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky . As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time , I referred the matter to university administrators , '' Paterno said . Sandusky , who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions , faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , and numerous other charges , including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child . In some cases , Sandusky promised boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers , according to the grand jury . `` One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002 , in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus , '' Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday . `` Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old , '' she said . The assistant reported the incident to head football coach Paterno , who in turn alerted athletic director Curley , said Kelly . Instead of reporting the incident to authorities , Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building , Kelly said . Sandusky , who retired from coaching in 1999 , was founder of the Second Mile , a charitable organization that began as a group foster home `` dedicated to helping troubled boys , '' the grand jury states . He was arrested and released Saturday on $ 100,000 unsecured bail . `` If this is true we were all fooled , along with scores of professionals trained in such things , and we grieve for the victims and their families . They are in our prayers , '' Paterno said in his statement . He added : `` I understand that people are upset and angry , but let 's be fair and let the legal process unfold . In the meantime I would ask all Penn Staters to continue to trust in what that name represents , continue to pursue their lives every day with high ideals and not let these events shake their beliefs nor who they are .

360,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A lawsuit filed January 30 by baseball great Roberto Alomar 's ex-girlfriend alleges he engaged in unprotected sex with her while suffering from HIV/AIDS . Roberto Alomar 's ex-girlfriend says he had unprotected sex with her while infected with HIV . Ilya Dall is asking for $ 15 million for `` personal injuries '' suffered due to Alomar 's negligence . She and her two children lived with the former New York Mets slugger for three years . She alleges that he started exhibiting signs of HIV as early as 2005 , but twice refused recommendations for an HIV test by his doctor , saying that earlier tests for the disease had come back negative , according to court papers . Alomar 's lawyer , Charles Bach , was not available for comment , but attorney Luke Pittoni , who also represents Alomar , said , `` We believe this is a totally frivolous lawsuit -- these allegations are baseless , he 's healthy and he 'd like to keep his health status private . We 'll do our talking in court . '' Anthony Piancentini , who is representing Dall , said he has `` no comment '' at this time . Dall says in court papers that Alomar told her `` I do n't have HIV . '' She alleges he `` lied and purposefully misrepresented his physical condition '' and `` that he was endangering the health and well being of -LSB- Dall -RSB- by continuing to have unprotected sexual relations with -LSB- her -RSB- , '' according to the lawsuit . Court papers list several physical ailments that Dall says Alomar exhibited from early 2005 on , including white spots on his mouth and throat , extreme fatigue , back and vision problems , and shingles . In early 2006 , Alomar submitted to an HIV test that , according to court papers , confirmed he was HIV positive in February 2006 . Dall says she went for an HIV test shortly afterward and the results were negative . The couple visited a disease specialist shortly after Alomar 's diagnosis , who found a mass in Alomar 's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS , according to the lawsuit . Dall alleges that a few days later , Alomar 's skin was turning purple and he was foaming at the mouth ; a spinal tap on February 21 , 2006 , confirmed he had full-blown AIDS , court papers said . Dall claims in the lawsuit that Alomar 's negligence caused her severe `` emotional distress '' over the health of her children . Court papers say that because the couple lived with the children , they may have been exposed to Alomar 's saliva or blood in the bathroom , through things like toothbrushes and other items . Dall claims to suffer from `` permanent emotional distress '' even after repeatedly testing negative for HIV . The lawsuit claims her fear of contracting the disease is known as `` AIDS phobia '' and that she suffers from permanent post-traumatic stress disorder . Alomar requested Tuesday that the suit be moved to Brooklyn , New York , federal court . It was originally filed in Supreme Court in Queens , New York . An initial conference on the case is expected on April 15 in Brooklyn federal court . Alomar is the son and brother of major leaguers -- father Sandy Alomar was a second baseman with several teams between 1964 and 1978 and brother Sandy Alomar Jr. is a former catcher who played from 1988 to 2007 . Roberto Alomar retired in 2004 with a .300 lifetime batting average , 12 All-Star game selections and 10 Gold Gloves . He was the All Star Game MVP in 1998 and played on two Toronto Blue Jays World Series champion teams . Alomar , then playing for the Baltimore Orioles , is also known for an incident in 1996 during a game against the Blue Jays when he spat in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck following a heated argument over a third strike . After the incident , Alomar claimed the umpire uttered a slur to him during the argument .",What did the ex-girlfriend say he denied having ?,unprotected sex with her while suffering from HIV/AIDS
361,"Beijing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prominent Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo , who was arrested in 1989 for his role in the Tiananmen Square protest , faces trial Wednesday for allegedly `` inciting subversion '' in a more recent case . Liu , a former university lecturer and literary critic , faces a possible 15-year jail sentence , amid growing international outrage over his yearlong detention , according to media reports . The trial begins Wednesday at 9 a.m. local time -LRB- Tuesday 8 p.m. ET -RRB- . On Monday , the Times of London quoted Liu 's wife , Liu Xia , as saying , `` I have no hope whatsoever , I ca n't even attend the trial . '' She said she planned to wait outside the courthouse . `` I think he will be sentenced to more than ten years , '' she said . Liu , 53 , was detained on December 8 , 2008 , and held under `` residential surveillance '' as police investigated the case , according to the PEN American Center , a U.S. literary and human rights organization . On June 23 of this year , he was arrested and charged with inciting subversion of state power , the organization said . Liu is on the PEN board of directors . The case was turned over to the prosecutor 's office December 8 -- one year from the time Liu was detained . Liu co-authored Charter 08 , `` a declaration calling for political reform , greater human rights , and an end to one-party rule in China that has been signed by hundreds of individuals from all walks of life throughout the country , '' PEN says on its Web site . The group said Liu was arrested before the formal release of Charter 08 . `` Liu has been engaged in agitation activities , such as spreading of rumors and defaming of the government , aimed at subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialism system in recent years , '' according to a police statement reported by China 's state-run Xinhua news agency . The statement claimed Liu confessed to the charge during a preliminary police investigation . Liu served as an adviser to student leaders during the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989 . Along with three other intellectuals , he took part in hunger strikes there on June 2 of that year prior to the crackdown to show support for the flagging student protests . He was arrested two days after the Tiananmen crackdown and was released in 1991 . In May 1995 he was detained again for collecting signatures for a petition calling for human rights guarantees . The U.S. government has pressed for Liu 's release . `` The U.S. government is deeply disturbed by reports that Liu Xiaobo has been formally arrested and charged with serious crimes , '' said Richard Buangan , deputy spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing , following Liu 's latest arrest . `` We call on the government of China to release Mr. Liu and respect the rights of all Chinese citizens who peacefully express their desire for internationally recognized freedoms .

362,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roman Polanski is regarded as one of the finest directors of his generation , winning an Oscar for `` The Pianist '' and nominations for `` Tess '' and `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but he is probably as equally well known for his own tumultuous life . Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate are pictured together in London in the 1960s . Polanski , who was arrested Saturday in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a decades-old sex charge , had lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States . The 76-year-old declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for `` The Pianist '' in 2003 . He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a tribute to him , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said . Polanski was put in `` provisional detention '' and now faces the possibility of being extradited to the U.S. , where a warrant for his arrest was issued in 1978 . The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl , but fled the U.S. before he could be sentenced . Polanski was accused of plying the girl , then known as Samantha Gailey , with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house . He was 43 at the time . Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was . According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as `` sullen . '' `` She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 . She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing , '' Huston said . Watch as filmmakers rally round Polanski '' She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl . `` I do n't think he 's a bad man , '' she said in the report . `` I think he 's an unhappy man . '' Polanski was born in Paris in 1933 of Polish-Jewish parents . Aged three , he and his family returned to Krakow in his father 's native Poland . After the Nazis invaded his parents were sent to concentration camps : his mother was gassed at Auschwitz although his father survived the war . The young Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto and `` soared out of Poland on sheer personality , '' according to director Marina Zenovich , whose 2007 documentary `` Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired , '' paints a sympathetic picture of the exiled movie legend . Growing up in war-torn Poland , the young Polanski found comfort in the cinema and in acting in radio dramas , on stage and in films . In 1962 , Polanski directed his first feature-length film , `` Knife in the Water . '' Poorly received in Poland it was a sensation in the West , and won an Academy Award nomination as Best Foreign Film . See images of Polanski 's life on cellulloid '' He later moved to England , co-starring with American actress Sharon Tate , whom he married in 1968 , in the Hammer horror parody , `` Dance of the Vampires/The Fearless Vampire Killers , or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are in My Neck . '' Following his move to Hollywood , Polanski was at his peak : he was one of the hottest directors thanks to the critical and commercial hit Rosemary 's Baby and he was married to the beautiful Tate . `` At a certain point in his life , Roman Polanski had a lot of hope , '' Zenovich told TIME magazine in 2008 . `` He was living this great life . He was so talented and everyone wanted to work with him . '' But that hopeful period ended when Tate , eight months ' pregnant , was murdered by followers of Charles Manson in 1969 . According to TIME , Polanski spent the first years after her death on a kind of sexual spree , and began spending time with younger and younger women , like 15-year-old Nastassja Kinski . When Polanski was arrested for assaulting Gailey , his case drew the attention of Judge Laurence J. Rittenband , who had earlier presided over Elvis Presley 's divorce , Marlon Brando 's child-custody battle and a paternity suit against Cary Grant . Rittenband , in a manner reminiscent of the one-liner-dropping judge in the Anna Nicole Smith case , was obsessed with the media . He even had a bailiff maintain a scrapbook of his newspaper clippings , according court filings . The case proceeded in a strange manner . Rittenband , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing . Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days . The judge 's bizarre behavior might have continued had Polanski not fled to France , where he has lived for the last 30 years , ultimately marrying again and having two children . Polanski has continued to make critically acclaimed films , such as `` Tess , '' an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel `` Tess of the d'Urbervilles '' which tells the story of a beautiful country girl -LRB- Nastassja Kinski -RRB- who is seduced by an older man . In 1981 , he returned to Poland to direct and star in a stage production of `` Amadeus . '' And 2002 's `` The Pianist , '' re-established Polanksi as a top-flight director . There have been repeated attempts to settle the sex case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski 's refusal to return to attend hearings . Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who `` drugged and raped a 13-year-old child . '' Polanski 's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request . In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court . Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way the director 's case was handled years ago . Polanski 's victim is among those calling for the case to be thrown out . Now married and known as Samantha Geimer , she filed court papers in January saying , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , now 45 , and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement . She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled . Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife 's killers died . By her own admission , Susan Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times . Polanski was filming in Europe at the time . Atkins , 61 , died Thursday . She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer .",Who murdered Pregnant Tate ?,by followers of Charles Manson in 1969
363,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former federal prosecutor was arrested Wednesday on charges related to the murder of a witness in a drug case , among many other counts , the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Newark , New Jersey , said . Former federal prosecutor Paul Bergrin is charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included a murder . Paul Bergrin and three others were taken into custody after a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted them on 14 counts , including murder , racketeering , wire fraud and money laundering charges , a statement from Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. said . The indictment charges Bergrin with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included the murder of a witness in a drug case and an attempt to hire a hit man in another drug case , the statement said . Bergrin also is charged with wire fraud and money laundering , Marra said . Gerald Shargel , Bergrin 's attorney , said his client would plead not guilty to all charges . `` This is largely dredging up old issues , and we intend to vigorously fight the charges , '' Shargel said . The U.S. Attorney 's Office statement said Bergrin was involved in the murder of a confidential witness in one federal drug case and tried to hire a Chicago , Illinois , hit man to kill a witness in another drug case . The second killing never occurred , the statement said , because the proposed hit man was a cooperating witness in the case . Marra called Bergrin 's alleged conduct `` simply shocking . '' `` A licensed lawyer , a former prosecutor essentially became one of the criminals he represents , supporting , encouraging , indeed directing , a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder and murder conspiracies , drug trafficking and financial fraud , '' Marra said in the statement . `` Bergrin can now expect to feel the full weight of the very legal system he turned on its head with his conduct . '' Bergrin was an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey before going into private practice . According to the New York Law Journal , Bergrin , 53 , pleaded guilty this month to two misdemeanor counts for his involvement with a prostitution ring . He later represented U.S. Army Sgt. Javal Davis , one of seven people charged in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq . In that case , Davis entered a plea agreement on reduced charges before his court martial began . A recorded message at Bergrin 's Newark , New Jersey , office said it was closed today , and messages left with Bergrin 's cell phone and the cell phones of two associates went unanswered .",What post did Bergrin hold in New Jersey before going into private practive ?,assistant U.S. attorney

'' He apologized to Hoboken residents for the `` disruption and disappointment '' the case has caused , but said , `` I am innocent of any criminal charges and I intend to fight the allegations against me .

365,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elvis Presley may have left the building three decades ago , but he raked in more money last year than many living titans of the music industry Singer Elvis Presley tops the Forbes list for the second year in a row , raking in $ 52 million last year . For the second year in a row , Presley topped the Forbes magazine 's list of Top-Earning Dead Celebrities , hauling in $ 52 million last year . In comparison , the very-much-alive Justin Timberlake earned $ 44 million while another superstar , Madonna , made $ 40 million , the magazine reported Tuesday . The 30th anniversary of Presley 's death boosted attendance and merchandise sales last year at his Memphis , Tennessee , home , Graceland . A long list of licensing deals , such as a Presley show on satellite radio , added to the earnings . The business magazine has been compiling its annual list of departed celebrities ' earnings since 2001 . Since 2003 , the feature has coincided with Halloween . This year , the top 13 celebrities earned a combined $ 194 million in the last 12 months . The magazine says it talked to people inside the celebrities ' estates and calculated their gross earnings from October 2007 to October 2008 . Some celebrities are staples on the list , which is in its eighth year . Cartoonist Charles Schulz , who created Snoopy , Charlie Brown and the assorted cast of `` Peanuts '' characters , is second on the list . Schulz , who died in 2000 , had posthumous earnings last year of $ 33 million , the magazine reported . He owes his constant presence to a steady revenue stream from the ongoing licensing of his characters , the magazine said . Schulz and Presley join Theodor `` Dr. Seuss '' Geisel -LRB- this year 's No. 6 -RRB- , Beatles legend John Lennon -LRB- No. 7 -RRB- and actress Marilyn Monroe -LRB- No. 9 -RRB- as the only entertainers to make the list every year since its inception . Physicist Albert Einstein , best known for his theory of relativity , is fourth on the list . It is his third consecutive year making the Forbes rankings . Though he died in 1955 , a franchise bearing his name -- Baby Einstein -- made big bucks last year selling educational books , DVDs , CDs , toys and other products . It plans to expand into the young-adult market this year . Australian actor Heath Ledger , who died of an overdose in January , made his debut on the list in third place . The magazine estimated his earnings at $ 20 million , thanks to the success of the movie , `` The Dark Knight , '' in which Ledger played the Joker . The movie grossed $ 991 million worldwide . Paul Newman , who died of lung cancer last month , also made his first appearance on the list , raking in $ 5 million . `` His income still largely stems from residuals from his classic pictures , as well as more recent productions , '' the magazine said . The legendary actor 's line of natural and organic food products , Newman 's Own , earned revenues of $ 120 million last year , but the earnings were not considered in the tally because Newman donated all profits to charity while he was living , the magazine said . Several entertainers from last year 's list failed to make this year 's cut , including composer , producer and Beatles guitarist George Harrison , rapper/actor Tupac Shakur , `` Godfather of Soul '' James Brown , and reggae legend Bob Marley .",Why was Ledger on the list ?,"thanks to the success of the movie , `` The Dark Knight"
366,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday called on President-elect Barack Obama to govern from the middle , as her party sat poised to gain its widest House majority in 15 years . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-California , celebrates election victories Tuesday night in Washington . According to projections , Democrats in the House were on track Wednesday to increase their majority by at least 18 seats , a margin that would give Obama a formidable tool to push his legislative agenda after his January 20 inauguration . Democrats took at least 22 seats from Republicans in Tuesday 's election , with the GOP taking four seats from the Democrats , according to CNN projections . With winners yet to be called for eight of the House 's 435 seats , Democrats were projected to win 254 seats , with Republicans having 173 . '' I do n't know what the final number will be , '' Pelosi said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference on Capitol Hill . `` But it will be well over 250 . It 's a signal of the change that the American people want . '' Pelosi , D-California , said she hoped Obama would `` bring people together to reach consensus '' on issues that concern Americans . `` A new president must govern from the middle , '' she said . Topping her agenda , she said , would be `` growing the economy , expanding health care , ending dependence on foreign oil and ending the war in Iraq . '' When he woke up Wednesday morning , Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said , he felt like the boy who stubbed his toe , the character in a quote from President Lincoln , who said : `` It hurts too bad to laugh , and I 'm too big to cry . '' Duncan also called on the president-elect to govern from the center and warned that if Democrats moved too far to the left , Republicans could take back seats in the 2010 midterm elections . `` The last two times Democrats controlled the House , Senate and the presidency , they choked on the bone of responsibility , '' he said . `` They lurched far to the left and introduced the country to President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Newt Gingrich . '' Among Tuesday 's GOP casualties was longtime Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut , whose reputation for occasionally bucking his party could n't keep him from losing to Democrat Jim Himes . Shays ' defeat leaves New England without any Republicans in the House . Shays was seeking his 11th full term . Watch Pelosi say Americans voted for change '' Heading into Election Day , the Democrats had a 235-199 House majority . The Democrats ' gains come two years after they took control of the House -- with a gain of 30 seats -- after 12 years in the minority . Here are highlights of other races from Tuesday with projected winners : Democrats gained at least two seats in Ohio , including that of Rep. Steve Chabot , who was seeking an eighth term in a Cincinnati-area district that normally votes about evenly for GOP and Democratic presidential candidates . CNN projects that Chabot lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus . Just two years earlier , Chabot was re-elected with 52 percent of the vote despite an anti-Republican tide that helped Democrats capture Ohio 's governorship and take a U.S. Senate seat . Democrats also gained a seat left open by retiring Rep. Ralph Regula . Democrat John Boccieri defeated the GOP 's Kirk Schuring in the northeastern Ohio contest . • In New York , Democrats won three Republican seats , including two left open by incumbents not seeking re-election . In one of the open races , Democrat Mike McMahon won the last GOP-held seat in New York City , defeating the GOP 's Robert Straniere . Democrat Dan Maffei defeated Republican Dale Sweetland , who was trying to win a seat vacated by 10-term GOP Rep. Jim Walsh . In a rematch of a 2006 race , former naval officer Eric Massa beat GOP Rep. Randy Kuhl in a western New York district that generally votes Republican . • Freshman Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minnesota , was projected to survive a race that tightened after she accused Obama of having `` anti-American views . '' She was leading Democratic challenger Elwyn Tinklenberg 47 percent to 43 percent with 86 percent of precincts reporting . Bachmann set off a storm of criticism in October when she said Obama 's connection to 1960s radical William Ayers made her concerned that Obama may have anti-American views . Bachmann 's comments prompted a flood of fundraising for Tinklenberg . • In Florida , Democrats captured from Republicans two of the four seats that analysts thought they could win . Democrat Suzanne Kosmas defeated Rep. Tom Fenney , and Democrat Alan Grayson defeated Rep. Ric Keller . However , brothers and Republicans Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart , who represent districts in southern Florida , held off their Democratic challengers . Lincoln Diaz-Balart won a ninth term , defeating former Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez . • Democratic incumbents were n't invulnerable in Florida . Rep. Tim Mahoney -- a south-central Florida Democrat elected to replace scandal-plagued GOP Rep. Mark Foley in 2006 -- lost to his Republican challenger , Tom Rooney . Mahoney already was going to have a tough race in his Republican-leaning district . But the race became tougher in mid-October with allegations that Mahoney had an affair with one of his aides and paid her thousands of dollars in hush money . Mahoney admitted to causing `` pain '' in his marriage , but he denied paying the aide to keep quiet . • Republican incumbents in two California districts maintained their House seats -- Rep. Ken Calvert defeated Democrat Bill Hedrick , a former teacher , and Brian Bilbray defeated Democrat Nicholas `` Nick '' Alexander Leibham , an attorney . In June 2006 , Bilbray narrowly won a special election to fill the vacant San Diego seat that once was occupied by disgraced former Rep. Randy `` Duke '' Cunningham . • In Pennsylvania , Rep. John Murtha handily defeated Republican challenger William Russell . Republicans had hoped to defeat Murtha after he called his western Pennsylvania district `` a racist area '' and `` redneck . '' • The House 's third-ranking Republican , Rep. Adam Putnam of central Florida , was re-elected but wrote to his colleagues Tuesday night that he would n't run again for a leadership post , saying he wanted to return his focus `` to crafting public policy solutions for America 's generational challenges . '' He is currently the GOP conference chairman . • In a heavily Republican district near Houston , Texas , Democratic Rep. Nick Lampson lost his re-election bid against Pete Olson . Lampson won the seat in 2006 after Republican and former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay resigned to fight state money laundering charges . • In Ohio 's 11th District , Democrats easily took a seat that was vacant since the death of Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones . Democrat Marcia Fudge defeated Republican Thomas Pekarek . Tubbs Jones , who represented the district that covers parts of Cleveland and its suburbs , died in August after brain hemorrhaging caused by an aneurysm . • The House 's first two Muslim members , Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana , won their contests Tuesday . Carson has won his first full term ; he had succeeded his grandmother , the late Rep. Julia Carson , in a March special election . • There was a party change in the race to represent New Jersey in the House . Democrat John Adler , 48 , defeated Republican Chris Myers , 42 , a Navy combat veteran . Adler , an attorney , sponsored New Jersey 's 2006 law prohibiting smoking in indoor public places and workplaces . He was also the sponsor of a law toughening car emission standards in the state . • Democrats took power from Republicans in Idaho , too . Walt Minnick beat Republican William Sali in a race for the House . Minnick has an MBA and law degree from Harvard University and served as a Nixon White House staffer in the early 1970s before starting a 21-year career at a wood-products maker .

367,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kim Clijsters defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in the final of the Brisbane International on Saturday , saving two match-points and wasting three as she won an epic clash . Henin , playing her first tournament since May 2008 , fought back from a set and 4-1 down against her fellow Belgian before losing 6-3 4-6 7-6 -LRB- 8-6 -RRB- in almost two and a half hours . However , Henin sustained an injury to her left leg and later confirmed on her Web site that she will miss next week 's Sydney Invitational , where she faced a possible second-round clash with Serena Williams , in order to recover in time for the decade 's first Grand Slam event , the Australian Open . Clijsters , who made history in September as the first unseeded player to win the U.S. Open in her third event back on the WTA Tour following her own short-lived retirement , took control as she won eight straight games . But fellow former world No. 1 Henin dug deep to level the match and then take a 3-0 lead in the deciding set . The 26-year-old Clijsters battled back to tie it up at 3-3 , and then both players squandered potentially match-winning break opportunities to ensure a tie-break . Clijsters raced to a 5-1 lead , helped by her first ace of the match -- coming off a second serve -- but then missed three match-point chances at 6-3 . Henin again fought back to level at 6-6 but then her 11th double-fault gave Clijsters the chance to finally close out for victory , her 11th in 23 meeting between the two players . Clijsters clinched her 36th WTA Tour title , leaving Henin stuck on 41 . `` What a match ! '' Clijsters said . `` I think we set the bar pretty high for ourselves for the rest of the year .

368,"Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A public memorial service for heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio is planned for Sunday , with members of the Westboro Baptist Church saying they will picket the ceremony . The church in Topeka , Kansas , is known for its intolerance of gays and its picketing of soldiers ' funerals . A picketing schedule on the church 's website said protesters will be at the Dio memorial at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles , accusing the 67-year-old rocker of worshipping Satan . Dio died on May 16 after a battle with stomach cancer . Charges of devil-worshipping have often been leveled against heavy metal music . Dio , in particular , was a favorite target . He popularized the `` devil 's horn '' gesture , where the index and the little fingers are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers . He has said he was taught by the sign by his superstitious Italian grandmother as a way to ward off the `` evil eye . '' But many fundamentalist Christians have taken issue with the gesture , alleging that it is a tribute to the devil . `` Ronnie hates prejudice and violence . We need to turn the other cheek on these people that only know how to hate someone they did n't know , '' said Dio 's wife , Wendy , about the planned protest . Wendy Dio said the memorial will host a donation center for her husband 's `` Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund , '' named after one his songs . Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell , a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons . All shows were canceled last March because of his illness . His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards , when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year 's Heaven and Hell album . Dio appeared frail , but he spoke while accepting his award . Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942 , Dio 's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s . His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s , when the group played heavy blues rock . Dio 's rock became darker with his band Rainbow , which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath . Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio , including `` Heaven and Hell '' in 1980 , `` Mob Rules '' in 1981 and `` Live Evil '' in 1982 . Dio left that band in 1982 , but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later . He formed the group Dio in 1982 and later Heaven and Hell .",What did Dio front ?,Black Sabbath
371,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq is raking in more money from oil exports than it is spending , amassing a projected four-year budget surplus of up to $ 80 billion , U.S. auditors reported Tuesday . Oil accounted for 94 percent of the Iraq 's revenue from 2005 to 2007 , a U.S. report says . Leading members of Congress , noting that Washington is paying for reconstruction in Iraq , expressed outrage at the assessment . One called the findings `` inexcusable . '' `` We should not be paying for Iraqi projects while Iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank , including outrageous profits from $ 4-a-gallon gas prices in the U.S. , '' said Sen. Carl Levin , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . `` We should require that U.S. taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects . '' Baghdad had a $ 29 billion budget surplus between 2005 to 2007 . With the price of crude roughly doubling in the past year , Iraq 's surplus for 2008 is expected to run between $ 38 billion and $ 50 billion , according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office . The United States has put about $ 48 billion toward reconstruction since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , auditors reported . About $ 23 billion of that was spent on the oil and electricity industries , water systems and security . Iraq spent $ 3.9 billion on those sectors from 2005 through April 2008 , according to the GAO , the investigative arm of Congress . The ongoing fighting there , a shortage of trained staff and weak controls have made it difficult for the Iraqi government to spend its surplus on needed projects , the agency 's report concluded . Levin , a Michigan Democrat , has been an outspoken critic of the slow progress of reconstruction and an advocate of a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq . His criticism Tuesday was echoed by Sen. John Warner , a Virginia Republican who is the former chairman and now a leading member of Levin 's committee . `` Despite Iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years , U.S. taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of Iraq reconstruction funds , '' Warner said in a joint statement with Levin . `` It is time for the sovereign government of Iraq , using its revenues , expenditures and surpluses , to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people . '' In its written response to the audit report , the Treasury Department said U.S. officials are working with Iraqis to address the issue , `` and we believe progress is being made . '' `` The report shows Iraq 's budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 , but it is equally important to realize that spending in Iraq is also increasing , '' Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Andy Baukol wrote to the GAO . Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki 's government submitted a $ 22 billion supplemental budget to the Iraqi parliament in July , including $ 8 billion in proposed capital expenditures , Baukol wrote . The issue raised the hackles of several members of Congress earlier this year -- particularly because Bush administration officials said on the eve of the war that Iraqi oil money would pay for reconstruction . In 2003 , then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told the House Appropriations Committee : `` We 're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction , and relatively soon . '' Rep. Henry Waxman , D-California , said Tuesday 's report `` is going to make a lot of American families very angry . '' `` The record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for Iraq , but the Iraqi government is n't spending the money on rebuilding , '' said Waxman , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . Levin spokeswoman Tara Andringa said the senator hopes to tighten rules governing U.S. expenditures on Iraqi reconstruction efforts in the next Pentagon authorization bill . The Iraqi surplus has piled up even though the country 's oil production has only recently matched prewar levels , according to the Brookings Institution 's latest Iraq Index . The country spent about 80 percent of its $ 29 billion operating budget in 2007 , including public services and salaries , but only 28 percent of its $ 12 billion investment budget , the GAO found . The export of crude oil accounted for 94 percent of Iraq 's revenues from 2005 to 2007 , the GAO reported .",What could Iraq 's budget surplus hit ?,up to $ 80 billion
372,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Kingdom votes on a new government May 6 through a political system that dates back centuries . When does an election happen ? The UK has no written constitution . Instead the country 's electoral system is based on a series of parliamentary acts dating back to the 17th century , when men wore the sort of tights and wigs still donned on ceremonial occasions by some officials of the Houses of Parliament . A general election is when voters nationwide choose lawmakers who will sit in the House of Commons , the lower chamber which initiates and approves legislation . An election must take place , by law , at least every five years . That said , governments can call an election at any time during their term . They could also be forced into an election if they lose a majority of lawmakers in the Commons . Who calls an election ? The starting gun in a general election is traditionally fired when the prime minister travels to Buckingham Palace to ask the queen , the UK 's head of state , to dissolve parliament by royal proclamation . An election must then take place within weeks . Since 1979 , elections have been held between April and June . It is customary for an election to be held on a Thursday . The vote is conducted through the `` first past the post '' system whereby the candidate in each constituency with the most votes wins the seat . If the queen is the head of state , then how come the UK a democracy ? Although the UK is a monarchy , the powers of the reigning head of state have gradually dwindled since King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 following the English Civil War between Royalists and Parliamentarians . Today , the monarch 's role is largely ceremonial and mostly restricted to state functions and appearing on stamps and banknotes . But the monarch still retains formal powers and opens parliament each year . How does parliament function ? The job of parliament is to make laws , scrutinize the actions of the government and debate issues of the day . The Commons -- which has green benches -- currently consists of 650 directly elected lawmakers known as Members of Parliament or MPs who each represent a geographical constituency . The upper house , the Lords -- which has red benches -- is mostly appointed by the government with members serving for life . Its main duty is to vote on legislation passed by the Commons and , when necessary , to send it back for further debate . In certain circumstances the government can force through legislation passed by the Commons but rejected by the Lords . How is an election decided ? Voters do not elect the prime minister , or head of government , directly . Rather , they vote to elect a candidate representing a particular party to serve as their local MP . The leader of the party which wins the most seats is then asked by the Queen to form a government . The leader of the second largest party in the Commons becomes the `` Leader of Her Majesty 's Opposition . '' MPs are elected by a plurality , rather than a majority , of votes . This means that a party can win a majority of seats in the Commons without achieving an overall majority in the overall popular vote . In fact , because there are three main parties in the UK it is extremely rare for a party to win an outright majority . The last prime minister elected by an outright majority was Stanley Baldwin , the Conservative Party leader , in 1931 . In 2005 , Tony Blair 's Labour Party won just 35 percent of the vote but still controlled a 66-seat majority in the House of Commons . So who can I vote for ? For most of the past century , British politics has been dominated by two parties , the left-wing Labour Party and the right-wing Conservative Party . That said , the boundaries between left and right have been blurred as each has strived to occupy the strategically important center ground . A third party , the centrist Liberal Democrats , usually picks up around 20 percent of votes but wins far fewer seats because it is squeezed between the two main parties . Parties from Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland also send small numbers of lawmakers to Westminster . Full guide to UK political parties What happens if a party does n't win a majority of seats ? If no party wins an overall majority -- a `` hung parliament '' -- then the leader of the party which takes the most seats will usually be invited by the monarch to form a government . But its powers will be limited because it can not control a majority of votes in the Commons . The party will usually call another election within months in a fresh attempt to secure a majority . What would a hung parliament mean in 2010 ? The last time this happened was in 1974 , when an election in February resulted in a hung parliament . A second election followed in October of the same year . Many opinion pollsters and observers believe that the 2010 general election will result in a hung parliament .",General elections in UK take place how often ?,at least every five years

Michael Phelps is facing a criminal investigation into whether he smoked marijuana on a college campus . Authorities will file criminal charges if the investigation determines that they are warranted , a spokesman said Tuesday . `` If someone breaks the law in Richland County , we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges , '' Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement . `` The Richland County Sheriff 's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law . If he did , he will be charged in the same manner as anyone else . The sheriff has a responsibility to be fair , to enforce the law and to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity . '' Phelps admitted `` regrettable behavior '' on Sunday after a British newspaper published a photograph of him smoking through a bong . The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina , in Richland County . Both university police and Columbia , South Carolina , police have said they would not pursue charges , according to The State newspaper in Columbia . It was unclear where the party took place , the paper said , or whether it was on the USC campus . `` I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment , '' said Phelps , who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , China , in a statement Sunday . See the photo on the cover of Star magazine '' `` I 'm 23 years old , and despite the successes I have had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner that people have come to expect from me , '' he said . `` For this , I am sorry . I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again . '' The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part , `` Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions . We are confident that , going forward , Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion . '' In 2004 , Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury , Maryland . He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation . He also issued an apology after that incident . Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who have signed on to `` My Victory , '' an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean .",What did the photo show Phelps doing ?,smoking through a bong

377,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A national campaign to inoculate tens of millions of Americans against H1N1 influenza began Monday , with health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee targeted as the first recipients , federal health authorities said . Health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee are among the first to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday . `` I think the world has watched history unfold , '' Dr. Judy Monroe , Indiana 's state health commissioner , told reporters at Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis . Earlier Monday , the hospital received a shipment of 52 boxes -- each containing 100 pre-filled sprayers . `` This first 5,200 doses that came to Marion County is really just the tip of the iceberg , '' Monroe said . Health Director Virginia Caine said the shipment will be split among the county 's hospitals . A similar scene unfolded at LeBonheur Children 's Medical Center in Memphis , Tennessee , where three children have died from H1N1 , sometimes referred to as swine flu . Jennilyn Utkov , a spokeswoman for LeBonheur , said the hospital received about 100 doses . By noon , the supply had been depleted . The vaccines shipped to both sites and to a few other places around the nation are the first of some 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Dr. Jay Butler told reporters at the Indianapolis event . That number includes both spray and injectable forms . Butler , who heads the agency 's 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force , has promised there will be enough for anyone who wants it . Butler said vaccine makers will ship 10 million to 20 million doses per week over the next couple of months . `` Is that fast enough ? '' he asked . `` No , but it 's what 's feasible . It 's what can be done . '' Monroe predicted that an ample supply of the injectable form will be available by mid-October . Last week , the CDC said it had received reports of 60 deaths of children related to H1N1 flu since April ; 11 of those deaths were reported last week alone . From August 30 until September 26 , the agency tallied 16,174 hospitalizations nationwide and 1,379 deaths associated with influenza virus infection . iReport.com : How should H1N1 be handled ? The 27 states reporting widespread flu activity are Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Mexico , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Texas , Tennessee , Virginia , Washington and Wyoming . Track the H1N1 virus '' Nearly all of the viruses identified so far are H1N1 , the agency said in a posting on its Web site . `` These viruses remain similar to the virus chosen for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine '' and remain susceptible to antiviral drugs `` with rare exception , '' it added . Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women , children , young adults and people with chronic lung disease , heart disease or diabetes -- should be among the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus , health officials have said . Understanding the H1N1 virus '' According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in late August , two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu . Health care workers may not necessarily be foremost among them . In the past , about 40 percent of health care workers have opted to be vaccinated against the flu , according to the CDC . Health officials also have recommended people reduce their chances of getting sick by washing their hands frequently , sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one 's hand and staying home when sick . More than 340,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and more than 4,100 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization . Many countries -- including the United States -- have stopped counting cases , particularly of milder illness , meaning that the true number is likely much higher .",How many doses has the U.S. government purchased ?,195 million
378,"Editor 's note : Dr. John Boyce , chief of the Infectious Diseases Section at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven , Connecticut , was lead author of the Centers for Disease Control 's national hand hygiene guidelines for health-care workers and heads the Hand Hygiene Resource Center . Dr. John Boyce says hands contaminated with virus are often a pathway for people to develop flu . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus -LRB- also known as swine flu -RRB- from Mexico to at least 19 other countries in less than 10 days is a cause of major concern . It emphasizes the need for the public to become familiar with how influenza is spread and which preventive measures they can use to reduce their chances of becoming infected . Although little information is available at this time , it appears that this influenza virus spreads from one person to another in the same way as other influenza viruses -- by `` droplet spread . '' Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes and expels droplets of fluid . Those droplets travel short distances -LRB- usually less than three feet -RRB- through the air and can be deposited on the mouth or in the nose of people or on surfaces . Those who develop influenza often shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions for several days after they become ill . Experience with other viruses suggests that individuals with influenza can contaminate their hands when coughing , sneezing or blowing their noses . The virus can survive on the hands for at least one hour . If a person whose hands are heavily contaminated touches a surface such as a doorknob , table or computer keyboard , they can deposit the virus onto that surface , where it can survive for minutes to several hours . One study conducted with a regular seasonal strain of influenza virus found that the virus could survive on facial tissues for several minutes and for two to eight hours on stainless steel or plastic surfaces . If another person touches a contaminated surface with his hands when the virus is still alive and then touches his own mouth or nose , he may become infected . Infection might also occur when a person with influenza shakes hands with another person who subsequently touches their own mouth or nose with their fingers . Several studies have found that many people touch their noses or mouths several times an hour during the course of daily activities . So there are plenty of opportunities for people to inadvertently introduce a flu virus into their bodies if their hands become contaminated . As a result , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- recommends that individuals perform hand hygiene -- also known as hand washing or decontamination -- frequently during influenza outbreaks . In addition to reducing the risk of developing influenza , hand hygiene can help protect people from becoming ill with several other respiratory viruses by eliminating these organisms from the hands . A recent study found that hand washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer were both highly effective in reducing a seasonal strain of influenza virus on the hands . This should also be true for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus . Either plain soap or antimicrobial soap will reduce the amount of virus on the hands . To ensure decontamination , be sure to wash your hands vigorously and keep both soap and water on your hands for at least 15 seconds . When sinks are not readily available , alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a convenient and effective way of eliminate the virus from hands . Use an amount of sanitizer at least the size of quarter or enough to keep your hands wet for at least 15 to 20 seconds while you 're rubbing them together . The CDC also recommends that people should avoid touching their mouths , noses and eyes , since surfaces they touch may be contaminated when flu virus is present . People who develop influenza or other respiratory viral infections should also clean their hands after blowing their nose or after covering a cough with their hands . Since droplet spread is the most common way influenza is transmitted from person to person , the CDC also recommends avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick . If you do become ill with influenza , the CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others . Hand hygiene is an important tool in preventing infection from influenza viruses such as this recent strain and is an easy and effective way to prevent contracting infectious diseases in general . Take the time to educate yourself about proper hand hygiene to protect both yourself and your family . Note : Further information about the 2009 H1N1 influenza -LRB- swine flu -RRB- outbreak can be obtained by going to CDC 's Web site .

379,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans . E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals . Known as `` e-cigarettes , '' the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals , spiced with flavors such as chocolate , cola or bubble gum . While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a `` healthy way '' to smoke , federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user . `` The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public , '' said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg , commissioner of the FDA . CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere , one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes , after the FDA announcement , and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment . Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval , the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user . That is why the FDA began to test them . The FDA 's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes . In releasing its information , the FDA did not identify the two companies , but said in one sample , diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected . Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them , the FDA said . The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008 . To date , 50 shipments have been stopped . The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . `` We know very little about these devices , said Dr. Jonathan Samet , director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California , `` but to say they are healthy -- that 's highly doubtful . '' Samet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings . Dr. Jonathan Winickoff , chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium , said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes . `` It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations , or even enforce rules that they not be used , '' he said . `` Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products , '' said Dr. Matthew McKenna , director of the Office of Smoking and Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` It 's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general . '' The FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court . The FDA suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA 's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program either online , by regular mail , fax or phone .

381,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This month the U.S. government has introduced major changes that will affect millions of travelers to the U.S. who do not need a visa . Instead of filling in the green visa waiver form en route , short-term visitors must register their details online at least three days before they depart . The measure is designed tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. . The new system , known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorization -LRB- ESTA -RRB- , does not become compulsory until January 12 , 2009 . But travelers are urged to prepare for the new rules in advance . ESTA applies to citizens from the 27 Visa Waiver Program -LRB- VWP -RRB- countries that includes most of western Europe in addition to New Zealand , Japan , Brunei and Australia . Visitors are recommended to submit applications no later than 72 hours before departure in case further inquiry is necessary . But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assured travelers that the system can handle last-minute and emergency requests . Applications can be made at any time , even if travelers have no specific travel plans . And if itineraries change , information can be easily updated on the ESTA Web site . Once travelers are authorized , they can travel for up to two years or until their passport expires , whichever comes first . From mid-January , travelers who have not received approval may be denied boarding , delayed processing , or denied admission at a U.S. port of entry . Passengers must submit the same information that is currently required in the I-94 immigration form . This includes biographical data , travel information as well as questions regarding communicable diseases , arrests and convictions . Registration is possible through the U.S. government ESTA Web site . In most cases , eligibility for travel will be approved immediately . Applicants who receive an `` Authorization Pending '' response will need to check the Web site for updates . Applicants whose ESTA applications are denied will be referred to Travel.State.Gov for information on how to apply for a visa . ESTA does not change the rules for citizens from countries that require visas . But the U.S. is due to extend the visa waiver program and has signed agreements with eight countries including the Czech Republic , Hungary and South Korea . Travelers are advised that ESTA does not guarantee entry into the United States . The final decision rests with the immigration official at the port of entry .",When does the system become mandatory ?,"January 12 , 2009"
383,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The forthcoming trial in Germany of John Demjanjuk could be the last occasion on which a Nazi war crimes suspect faces prosecution . German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp . But the legacy of decades-old efforts to bring the perpetrators of World War II atrocities to justice means that those who commit similar offences in the 21st century will not be able to hide from their past so easily , according to a leading war crimes prosecutor . Many leading Nazis such as Hermann Goering , Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer were prosecuted by the main allies -- the U.S. , the Soviet Union and the UK -- shortly after the end of the war at the Nuremberg Trials . South African judge Richard Goldstone , formerly the chief U.N. prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda , told CNN that Nuremberg had been the `` first attempt of any importance to hold war criminals accountable '' and had laid the foundations for the development of modern humanitarian law . Yet many lower-ranking servants of the Nazi regime and its allies were able to escape punishment for their crimes , assuming new identities , fleeing Europe or even finding employment with Soviet or western security agencies as determination to bring them to justice waned with the advent of the Cold War , according to Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center . `` These murderers walked into small cities and killed men , women and children and walked away without a trace , '' Hier told CNN . `` The sad thing is that had the world wanted to prosecute Nazi war criminals after Nuremberg , and had -LRB- countries -RRB- put up the budget and the resources then every one of these elusive criminals would have been brought to justice . '' But Goldstone said that the creation in 2002 of the International Criminal Court marked a `` very important step forward '' to ensure that future atrocities would not be so quickly forgotten . While previous tribunals investigating crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia were ad hoc creations set up by the U.N. Security Council , the ICC is a permanent institution with a specific remit to investigate and prosecute cases of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . Goldstone said that developments in humanitarian law and the evolution of international justice meant that modern institutions were more sophisticated and fairer than Nuremberg had been , recognizing the rights of victims to representation but also ensuring a fair trial for defendants . `` Modern international law requires trials that are a lot fairer than the trials that were put on at Nuremberg , '' he said . The jurisdiction of the ICC is currently recognized by 108 countries -- though not by the U.S. , Russia or China . But Goldstone said the court was `` moving quickly '' towards universal ratification and said U.S. President Barack Obama 's new administration was likely to be more cooperative and friendlier to the ICC than predecessor George W. Bush had been in office . `` I 'd love to see the day when there is universal ratification because when that happens there will be nowhere for war criminals to run to , '' he said . Demjanjuk , an 89-year-old native Ukrainian deported from the U.S. this week , is alleged to have been a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and is accused of being an accessory to the murder of more than 29,000 people . Hier said Demjanjuk 's extradition marked the culmination of greater efforts in the U.S. since the late 1970s to send suspected war criminals to face trial . An Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979 to hunt for war criminals on U.S. soil , while legislation allowed even suspects who had acquired U.S. citizenship to be extradited for lying on their naturalization papers about their Nazi pasts . But he said Demjanjuk 's trial could be the last of its kind -- and not just because of the age of suspected war criminals still at large . `` You ca n't just have a trial with documents . You have to have living witnesses , '' Hier said . `` Most of those witnesses are very old , most of them are well into their 80s and beyond and they have to be in sufficient good health that they can be questioned and travel to take part in the trial . '' But Hier said it was very important that former Nazis were pursued to the grave , living out their final years with the fear that their past crimes could still catch up with them . '' -LRB- Nazi hunter -RRB- Simon Wiesenthal talked about two kinds of justice . There is the justice of handcuffs and putting someone on trial . But there is also a psychological fear of a knock on the door , '' he said . `` Every Nazi war criminal should live every night of his life with the possibility that in his case there will yet be a knock on the door .

384,"JOHANNESBURG , South Africa -- South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg . Steyn 's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa 's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings . Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287 . South Africa 's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings . They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs . Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor 's 15 . Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon . Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising . New Zealand , 41 for two overnight , lost nightwatchman Shane Bond , bowled by a Steyn yorker , before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming , who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip . Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled . Steyn 's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago . It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11 . South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply , but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge . They batted together for 205 minutes , Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76 . The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum 's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond , when the batsman had only scored two . `` The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum . It cost us a lot , '' said coach John Bracewell . E-mail to a friend",Who is Dale Steyn ?,South African fast bowler
386,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress pleaded guilty Thursday to a weapons charge stemming from a shooting incident at a nightclub last year , the Manhattan district attorney said . Former NFL wide receiver Plaxico Burress will serve two years in prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges . Burress , 32 , pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and will serve two years in prison , according to Alicia Maxey Greene , spokeswoman for district attorney Robert M. Morgenthau 's office . Two years of supervised release will follow his jail term , she said . Burress is free on bail and will be sentenced September 22 . A grand jury indicted the former New York Giants football player earlier this month on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and a single count of reckless endangerment in the second degree . He pleaded not guilty to those charges earlier this year . Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg November 29 , 2008 , with a .40 - caliber semi-automatic pistol he was carrying in the waistband of his jeans . The incident occurred in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan . A teammate who was with Burress , linebacker Antonio Pierce , drove him to a hospital and arranged to have the pistol delivered to Burress ' New Jersey home , according to an August 3 statement from the district attorney 's office . The district attorney also sought charges against Pierce , but the grand jury did not indict him . Burress was not licensed to carry a pistol in either New York or New Jersey . No one , including employees of the New York Presbyterian Hospital and the NFL , called the police to report the gunshot wound , as required by law . One of the hospital workers was suspended after the incident . Burress became a hero to New York Giants fans in the 2008 Super Bowl when he caught the game-winning touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning with 35 seconds remaining in the game . In the following year , however , Burress ' career with the Giants was marred by a series of incidents in addition to the shooting . He was suspended from the team in early October for missing a practice , and later that month the NFL fined him $ 45,000 after he argued with a referee and threw a football into the stands during a game . Burress was suspended from the Giants immediately after the shooting incident . The team released him in April .

388,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Robert Byrd came to Congress from West Virginia , a postage stamp cost 3 cents and kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr. Potato Head . On Wednesday , almost 57 years later , Byrd became the longest-serving member of Congress in history . Two days before he turns 92 , the eloquent legislator known for his encyclopedic knowledge of Senate rules and history surpasses Carl T. Hayden , the Arizona Democrat who served a total of 20,773 days in the U.S. House and Senate . With his 20,774 th day representing West Virginia -- six years in House and then nearly 51 years and counting in the Senate -- Byrd sets a record for longevity unlikely to be broken as the political climate turns toward term limits and growing public dissatisfaction with Congress . In a statement issued by his office , Byrd expressed his gratitude to `` the people of the great State of West Virginia '' for their long-standing confidence in him . His only regret , he said , was that his wife , Erma , who died in 2006 , would not be with him . `` I know that she is looking down from the heavens smiling at me and saying congratulations my dear Robert -- but do n't let it go to your head , '' Byrd 's statement said . In a career representing the West Virginia coal-mining country from which he emerged , Byrd has cast more Senate votes -LRB- 18,000-plus -RRB- and held more leadership positions -LRB- including two stints as majority leader -RRB- than any other senator . He has never lost an election . He was raised by an aunt and uncle after his mother died when he was a year old , and he did not graduate college until he received a degree in 1994 from Marshall University . In a sign of his Appalachian roots , Byrd was an avid fiddle player and appeared twice on the television program `` Hee Haw . '' He gave up playing in the 1980s because of a tremor in his hands . His early political years displayed some of the deeply rooted racism of the American South . Byrd was a member of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in the early 1940s , and later called it `` the most egregious mistake I 've ever made . '' In 1964 , he voted against the Civil Rights Act pushed by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson . But Byrd later followed a more traditional Democratic path . An ardent foe of President George W. Bush 's policies in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Byrd opposed creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 and called Bush `` dangerous , reckless and arrogant '' in February 2003 , six weeks before the Iraq war started . Three months later , he criticized Bush 's landing a jet on the USS Abraham Lincoln to signal the end of the Iraq war as `` flamboyant showmanship . '' On June 12 , 2006 , Byrd became the longest serving senator in history , and was re-elected to his ninth consecutive Senate term five months later . Things have changed since he arrived in Washington as a new congressman in 1953 , along with the first Eisenhower administration . Gas cost 20 cents a gallon then , and the average annual salary was less than $ 4,000 . Ten presidents later , Byrd is known for his devotion to his state and constituents . `` His number one priority has always been the people of West Virginia , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , says in a statement on Byrd 's Senate Web site . `` It has been a great example for all of us to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your state and the people in your state should have first priority . '' Byrd 's statement marking Wednesday 's achievement reflected that thinking . `` Although we are marking a longevity milestone , it has been the quality and dedication of service that has guided me over the years , '' Byrd said in his statement . `` I have strived to provide the people of West Virginia the best representation possible each of the 20,774 days which I have served in the Congress of the United States . '' He thanked his constituents for their support and for `` putting their trust and faith in me . '' Slowed by illness in recent years , including a six-week hospital stay this year because of a staph infection , Byrd concluded his statement with typical bravado . `` The only way for me to close on this historic day is to say that I look forward to serving you for the next 56 years and 320 days , '' he said . `` Thank you and may God bless you .

389,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harold Pinter , the Nobel Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter whose absurdist and realistic works displayed a despair and defiance about the human condition , has died , according to British media reports . He was 78 . The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007 . Pinter 's wife , Lady Antonia Fraser , confirmed his death . Pinter , who had been suffering from cancer , died on Christmas Eve , according to the reports . Fraser told the Guardian newspaper : `` He was a great , and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years . He will never be forgotten . '' Pinter was known for such plays as `` The Birthday Party '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , `` The Homecoming '' -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , `` No Man 's Land '' -LRB- 1974 -RRB- , `` Mountain Language '' -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , and `` Celebration '' -LRB- 2000 -RRB- . The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary `` Pinter pause '' -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations . His movie credits , like his plays , span the decades and include `` The Quiller Memorandum '' -LRB- 1965 -RRB- and `` The French Lieutenant 's Woman '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play `` Betrayal , '' the story of a doomed love affair told backward , which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley , Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge . He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005 . Pinter 's later plays were more overtly political , with works such as `` One for the Road '' -LRB- 1984 -RRB- and `` The New World Order '' -LRB- 1991 -RRB- focusing on state torture . In commentaries , he became a blistering critic of the United States , writing in his Nobel lecture that the country `` quite simply does n't give a damn about the United Nations , international law or critical dissent , which it regards as impotent and irrelevant . It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead , the pathetic and supine Great Britain . '' But Pinter could also be a man of great humor . In 2006 , he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier . `` Two days later , I woke up to find that I 'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature , '' he said . `` So life is really full of ups and downs , you see . '' Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10 , 1930 . He was the son of Jewish immigrants , his father a dressmaker , his mother `` a wonderful cook , '' he once recalled . In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts , then as now one of Great Britain 's most renowned drama schools . But the RADA did n't take ; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms . He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work , `` The Room , '' in 1957 . Later that year he wrote `` The Birthday Party , '' a `` comedy of menace , '' in the words of one critic , that helped make Pinter 's reputation -- though , in an irony he could appreciate , after it closed in London due to scathing notices . Ensuing Pinter plays , including `` The Dumb Waiter '' -LRB- 1957 -RRB- and `` The Homecoming , '' made him Britain 's most famous playwright , as influential to `` late 20th-century British theater -LSB- as -RSB- Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages , '' CNN.com 's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006 . `` What 's generally meant as a ` Pinter play ' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted , even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat , '' Anderson wrote . Pinter 's plays featured sparse dialogue , often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement . In `` The Birthday Party , '' a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it 's his birthday ; in `` The Homecoming '' -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family , where the wife becomes the center of attention . Pinter credited Samuel Beckett , among others , as an influence . -LRB- He starred in a production of Beckett 's `` Krapp 's Last Tape '' in 2006 . -RRB- In turn , writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter 's elliptical lead . `` One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness , '' Pinter once said . He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant . Following a 1980 divorce , Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser .",What did Pinter win for Literature in 2005 ?,the Nobel Prize

The idea is to fire up `` surge '' voters and motivate them to go to the polls again in this November 's midterm elections . According to national exit polls from 2008 , 11 percent of people who cast ballots in the presidential contest said they were first time voters , and seven out of 10 of those new voters said they backed Obama in the election . Many of those people were young voters , and exit polls indicated that two-thirds of people age 18-29 voted for Obama . In advance to Tuesday 's rallies , the president held a conference call with college and university journalists . `` You ca n't sit it out . You ca n't suddenly just check in once every 10 years or so , on an exciting presidential election , and then not pay attention during big mid-term elections where we 've got a real big choice between Democrats and Republicans , '' Obama said .

391,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week , a police spokesman said Wednesday . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero , but New York city officials said no . The controversial , outspoken president wanted to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said , citing Iranian officials . But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site , `` and it would not be possible for him to go where other people do n't go , '' Kelly told CNN . Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero , police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN . But , he said , `` If there were a further request , we 'd reject it '' because of security fears . Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader '' The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision , but in a statement issued Wednesday evening , it called the rejection `` unfortunate . '' Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda . Ahmadinejad 's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks , Mohammed Khatami , condemned them , and Tehran cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda 's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed . The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days . The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center , when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers . A third jet hit the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers . `` It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terror , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground , '' State Department spokesman Tom Casey said . Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit . Hillary Clinton , the New York senator and Democratic front-runner , called the request `` unacceptable . '' Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , a leading Republican , called it `` shockingly audacious . '' And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that `` under no circumstances '' should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site . Zalmay Khalilzad , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the site should not be `` used as a photo op . '' Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad 's hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium .

392,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At 51 years of age , Polish prime minister Donald Tusk has come a long way . As part of the Kashubian minority living in the Gdansk Region , he was born to working-class parents -- his father a carpenter and his mother a nurse . Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected in November 2007 . As a student of History at the University of Gdansk in the late 1970s , a period of growing discontent with the Communist regime in Poland , he became actively involved in the creation of the opposition Students ' Solidarity Committee , founded in reaction to the murder of student activist Stanislaw Pyjas by the State Security Service . Despite his anti-communist activities , he successfully finished his studies in 1980 and joined the Independent Solidarity Trade Union movement . When the Communists imposed martial law in 1981 he continued with his underground activities , writing pamphlets about the ideas of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek and the concept of private property . His heroes became former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher . With the fall of Communism in 1989 , the Solidarity Movement splintered . Lech Walesa , the former Solidarity Leader was elected President , while Tusk went on to co-found the KLD -LRB- Liberal and Democratic Congress Party -RRB- with other well-known figures . The Party stood for among other things : free market economy , privatization , individual freedom of Polish citizens and Polish accession to the EU . The following year , during the 1991 Parliamentary elections , the KLD won 37 seats in the lower house of the Polish Parliament . Not being able to follow up on their success in the 1993 elections , the KLD merged with the larger Democratic Union Party -LRB- UD -RRB- to form a new party called Freedom Union -LRB- UW -RRB- . Tusk soon became Deputy Chairman and in the 1997 elections , he was voted into the Senate . In 2001 , Tusk formed the Civic Platform Party -LRB- PO -RRB- , winning seats in that year 's parliamentary elections and becoming Deputy Speaker in parliament . But the Civic Platform was not able to sustain its success in the 2005 elections . Tusk and his party lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to Lech Kacczynski 's PiS -LRB- Law and Justice Party -RRB- . This setback was not to last as Tusk triumphed over Jaroslaw Kaczynsky 's PiS in the October 2007 elections and became prime minister of Poland . Tusk 's economic policies are pro-business : less bureaucratic hurdles and state interference making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses . He is also trying to woo back more than a million Poles who left the country to work in other European Union countries after it joined the EU in 2004 . Tusk is a keen footballer , viewed in his youth as a promising striker . He is married to historian Malgorzata and has two children , Kasia and Michal .",Where were they a student ?,University of Gdansk

Hillary Clinton in North Carolina Tuesday , but Clinton 's narrow victory in Indiana will likely send the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries . Sen. Barack Obama and his wife , Michelle , greet supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina . As polls closed in Indiana , Clinton had a double-digit lead over Obama , but by the end of the evening , Clinton 's lead had shrunk , dragging the race out until early Wednesday . A clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. Wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from Lake County , a Chicago suburb in northwestern Indiana with several precincts that went strongly for Obama . By Wednesday morning , all absentee ballots had been counted in Lake County and the final results showed Obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points . There were 115 delegates at stake in North Carolina and 72 in Indiana . Because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally , Obama added four delegates to his lead , according to CNN estimates . Obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in North Carolina . With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Obama held a 14-point lead over Clinton .

But today , what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington , '' Obama told supporters in Raleigh , North Carolina . Watch Obama thank his supporters '' Obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in North Carolina , according to exit polls , while Clinton claimed only 6 percent . Clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for Obama , according to the polls . Clinton told her supporters in Indianapolis , `` it 's full-speed on to the White House . '' Watch Clinton greet her supporters '' Clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in Indiana . She pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban Indiana during Tuesday 's primary . In CNN exit polling , Clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas , compared with 47 percent for Obama of Illinois . She took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with Obama 's 32 percent . In all , 1,738 voters were polled . Clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline . `` I believe that Americans need a champion in their corners , '' she said at a rally in Indianapolis . `` For too long we 've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected , but I do n't think that 's what Americans need . `` Standing up for working people is about the American dream and about the Democratic Party ; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together . '' Eighty-nine percent of Indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession . Clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to Obama 's 47 percent . The candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in West Virginia , Kentucky and Oregon . According to early exit polls , half of Clinton 's supporters in Indiana would not vote for Obama in a general election matchup with Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee . Watch what the exit polls show '' A third of Clinton voters said they would pick McCain over Obama , while 17 percent said they would not vote at all . Forty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would back Obama in November . Obama got even less support from Clinton backers in North Carolina , where 45 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for him over McCain . Thirty-eight percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for McCain while 12 percent said they would not vote . Obama voters appear to be more willing to support Clinton in November . In Indiana , 59 percent of Obama backers said they 'd vote for Clinton , and 70 percent of Obama backers in North Carolina said vote for her against McCain . Obama on Tuesday said he did n't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite . `` Tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that Sen. Clinton 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her , '' he said . `` I 'm here tonight to tell you that I do n't believe it . Yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides . Yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win . But ultimately , this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain . `` This election is about you -- the American people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future . '' Obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won , and he is ahead in the popular vote , if Florida and Michigan are not factored into the equation . Those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules . With neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination by June 3 , the end of the primary season , the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates : Democratic governors , members of Congress and party officials .

394,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paying for sex with trafficked or exploited women would become a crime under new laws proposed by the UK government Wednesday . Under proposed laws , it would be illegal to buy sex from a trafficked or exploited woman in the UK . The act of purchasing sex is not currently a criminal offense in England and Wales -- although there are laws against paying for sex in a public place and persistently soliciting prostitutes . Now UK Home Secretary -LRB- interior minister -RRB- Jacqui Smith says she is proposing the new measures to protect vulnerable women and tackle the demand for prostitution . Britain 's interior ministry , known as the Home Office , introduced the new measures Wednesday after a six-month review that looked at what else the government could do to protect women being exploited for sexual gain . `` I want to do everything we can to protect the thousands of vulnerable women coerced , exploited or trafficked into prostitution in our country , and to bring those who take advantage of them to justice , '' Smith said in a statement . Smith said the new measures will shift the focus onto sex buyers because they create demand for prostitution and demand for the trafficking of women for sex . `` There will be no more excuses for those who pay for sex , '' she added . As part of the review , the government looked at the experience of other countries including Sweden -- which has criminalized paying for sex -- and the Netherlands , where brothels are licensed . The government estimates around 80,000 people are involved in prostitution in Britain , with about 4,000 women having been trafficked for sexual exploitation . It says the prostitution market nationwide is worth up to # 1 billion -LRB- $ 1.52 billion -RRB- . Trafficking is the movement of women from one place to another for the purposes of sex . British Authorities have said trafficking usually involves the trafficker promising to bring a woman to Britain for a better life and then forcing her into prostitution . The measures -- which must be approved by Parliament -- would mean that those committing the new offense would be given a criminal record and fined # 1,000 -LRB- $ 1,520 -RRB- -- even if it was a person 's first offense and the offender did not know the prostitute was being controlled by a pimp or had been trafficked . Police would also be given powers to close and seal premises suspected of being used for sexual exploitation , such as brothels , which the government said will prevent further exploitation and abuse from taking place . Current law prohibits curb crawling , which involves soliciting prostitutes from a motor vehicle persistently or in a manner that causes annoyance to the neighborhood . It also prohibits `` persistent soliciting , '' which is essentially curb crawling without a car . But representatives of sex workers attacked the plans Wednesday , saying they will force prostitution further underground and make women more vulnerable to violence . `` It 's going to really make it more difficult for men to use the sex industry , and it 's going to mean that women are going to have to take more risks in order to earn the same money , '' said Cari Mitchell , a spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes . `` It 's also going to drive it underground . It 's going to increase the stigma . '' Mitchell said the government 's figures are inflated , and that most immigrant women working as prostitutes have not been trafficked and are working independently . The new measures , she said , confuse prostitution with trafficking and take the focus off those women who may be vulnerable . `` Of women who may be trafficked and forced , what they need is to be able to come forward and report to the police without any fear of being deported , '' Mitchell told CNN .

The harmful short-term effects of secondhand smoke are well known ; the long-term consequences are n't as clear . Specifically , their lungs have slightly more , and larger , emphysema-like `` holes '' than those with less smoke exposure , says Gina Lovasi , M.P.H. , Ph.D. , of Columbia University , and her colleagues . Although breathing tests showed that the smoke-exposed lungs were functioning just fine , Lovasi said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road . Health.com : Should smoking around kids be illegal ? Emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath , coughing , fatigue , and weight loss . About 24 million people in the United States have emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis , which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -LRB- COPD -RRB- ; however about half of those people do n't realize they have COPD . The lung condition is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States , and smoking is a major cause of COPD . Health.com : I 'm a nonsmoker , but I have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition `` The interesting part about this is that we do n't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco , '' says Lovasi , who is scheduled to present her findings on Tuesday at the American Thoracic Society 's 105th International Conference in San Diego . `` We can still see a difference even decades later . '' The harmful short-term effects of breathing other people 's cigarette smoke are well known , but the long-term consequences are n't as clear . To investigate , Lovasi and her team looked at CT scans of the lungs of 1,781 nonsmoking 45 - to 84-year-olds taking part in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis -LRB- MESA -RRB- trial . Health.com : 5 celebrities who had -- or are at risk of -- the lung disease COPD About half of the study participants said that no one with whom they lived during childhood smoked cigarettes at home , 31 percent lived with one person who smoked at home , and 17 percent lived with two or more smokers . Lovasi and her team checked the lung CT scans for large areas where the density was similar to air -LRB- lung tissue is naturally denser than air -RRB- , and also calculated what percentage of their lungs was made up of these `` holes . '' Health.com : My smoker 's cough turned out to be emphysema `` The lungs are supposed to have air in them , but it 's important that the air is interspersed with blood vessels so that we can get the oxygen out of the air , '' she says . `` Small holes can expand over time and merge to form larger holes . '' For people who had n't grown up with smokers , 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air-like density , while `` holes '' made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood . The more heavily smoke-exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs . In comparison , `` someone with emphysema would typically have between 30 percent and 60 percent of the lungs classified as air-like -LRB- or emphysema-like -RRB- using the threshold we used for our study , '' says Lovasi . Health.com : 1 in 3 smokers would kick habit to protect pet Lovasi says she and her colleagues will be following the MESA participants over time to see how their lungs change , and whether people with more early smoke exposure are indeed more vulnerable to lung problems later on .

398,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home , a medical examiner said Tuesday . Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his family in June . Dr. Kris Sperry , Georgia 's chief medical examiner , said the body of Benoit 's wife , Nancy , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs . Sperry said it 's likely the Benoits ' 7-year-old son , Daniel , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy 's system . Xanax is not normally prescribed for children , Sperry said . Chris Benoit 's body contained an `` elevated '' level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , Sperry said . But , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death . `` There 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , '' Sperry said . `` The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , '' he said . `` It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency . '' The investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in Benoit 's body . The investigation into the Benoits ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called '' ` roid rage , '' leading him to kill his wife and son . An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy . The Orlando , Florida , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids . Phil Astin , Benoit 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs . Astin has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest . Although Benoit 's name was not mentioned in Astin 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths . `` Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville , Georgia , Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4 , 2006 , through May 9 , 2007 , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone . Nancy Benoit 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body `` could come from the decomposition process . '' Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel 's body . Daniel 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but Sperry could not speculate why . District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths , which he said is ongoing . `` We 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , '' he said . `` We 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household . This -LRB- the toxicology report -RRB- adds one element to all the other elements .

399,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hydroxycut products , popular dietary supplements used for weight loss , have been linked to liver damage and are being recalled , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday . The FDA has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries , including a death , linked to Hydroxycut products . The FDA said it has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries linked to Hydroxycut products , which are also used as energy enhancers and as fat burners . The reports include the 2007 death of a 19-year-old man living in the Southwest , which was reported to the FDA in March . Other serious liver problems reported included liver damage that resulted in a transplant in 2002 , liver failure , jaundice , seizures and cardiovascular problems . The FDA is warning consumers to immediately stop using 14 Hydroxycut products manufactured by Iovate Health Sciences Inc. of Oakville , Ontario , and distributed by Iovate Health Sciences USA Inc. of Blasdell , New York . The company is voluntarily recalling the following products : Hydroxycut Regular Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Max Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Regular Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Drink Packets -LRB- Ignition Stix -RRB- , Hydroxycut Max Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Liquid Shots , Hydroxycut Hardcore RTDs -LRB- Ready-to-Drink -RRB- , Hydroxycut Max Aqua Shed , Hydroxycut 24 , Hydroxycut Carb Control and Hydroxycut Natural . Watch more on the FDA 's concern '' According to the FDA , last year , Iovate sold more than 9 million units of Hydroxycut products , which were distributed widely to grocery stores , health food stores and pharmacies . `` The FDA urges consumers to discontinue use of Hydroxycut products in order to avoid any undue risks . Adverse events are rare , but exist . Consumers should consult a physician or other health care professional if they experience symptoms possibly associated with these products , '' said Dr. Linda Katz , interim chief medical officer of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition . Liver damage is rare , but patients who experienced problems were taking doses recommended on the product label , the FDA said . Symptoms include brown urine , nausea , vomiting , fatigue , stomach pain , itching and light-colored stools . The FDA has not determined what specific ingredients are responsible for the problems , because the products contain a variety of overlapping ingredients and herbal extracts . Dietary supplements sold before October 1994 are not required to undergo any FDA review before going to market . The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 required manufacturers to ensure a supplement to be safe before marketing . But manufacturers still do n't need to register a product with the FDA or get approval before selling a supplement . The agency can take action against an unsafe supplement once it 's on the market . Since December 2007 , any serious adverse event reported to the manufacturer must now be reported to the FDA within 15 days . The Council for Responsible Nutrition , the leading trade association representing the dietary supplement industry , said that both the FDA and Iovate `` took appropriate action today . '' `` We commend FDA for warning consumers of a potential safety problem associated with these products , and were encouraged to see that the company -- Iovate Health Sciences -- agreed to recall the products from the market until further determinations can be made , '' said Steve Mister , the council 's president and CEO .",What is hydoxycut used for ?,popular dietary supplements used for weight loss
400,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They share a deep sorrow : an idealistic American who tried to protect the Kurds of Iraq , a Canadian general who refused to follow orders in Rwanda , a French priest who fought for the soul of Cambodia . CNN 's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe , Africa and Asia for `` Scream Bloody Murder . '' Each one tried to focus the world 's attention on the world 's most heinous crime : genocide . Each time , they were shunned , ignored or told it was someone else 's problem . To understand why , CNN 's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe , Africa and Asia for a two-hour documentary , `` Scream Bloody Murder . '' Having reported on mass atrocities around the world , this time Amanpour traced the personal accounts of those who tried to stop the slaughter . The yearlong CNN investigation found that instead of using a U.N. treaty outlawing genocide as a springboard to action , political leaders have invoked reason after reason to make intervention seem unnecessary , pointless and even counter-productive . Map : See the locations featured in the documentary '' December marks the 60th anniversary of the U.N.

Read the 1948 Genocide Convention -LRB- pdf -RRB- `` The Genocide Convention should have stopped genocide , but it did n't , '' said Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel . Intervention is a daunting challenge , he believes , because of a tendency to minimize accounts from refugees and victims . `` It 's better not to believe , because if you believe , you do n't sleep nights . And how can you eat ? How can you drink a glass of wine when you know ? '' See images from locations in the documentary '' 1970s : Cambodia Father François Ponchaud was a Catholic missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge guerillas -- communist revolutionaries -- seized power in 1975 . They expelled all foreigners from the country . But working from France , Ponchaud gathered refugee accounts and monitored radio broadcasts to document the slave labor , torture and executions the Khmer Rouge were using to kill one-fourth of Cambodia 's population . He published his findings in a major French newspaper and wrote a book , `` Year Zero . '' But even so , Ponchaud tells Amanpour , `` No one believed us . '' Watch a behind-the-scenes look at the making of ` Scream Bloody Murder ' '' 1980s : Iraq CNN found that intervention is often weighed against political and economic costs . Declassified U.S. government documents show that while Saddam Hussein was gassing Iraqi Kurds , the U.S. opposed punishing Iraq with a trade embargo because it was cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. farm exports . According to Peter Galbraith , then an idealistic Senate staffer determined to stop Hussein from committing genocide , the Reagan administration `` got carried away with their own propaganda . They began to believe that Saddam Hussein could be a reliable partner . '' Read once-secret U.S. documents 1990s : Bosnia Even extensive news coverage may not lead to intervention . During the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s , the media reported on the Bosnian Serbs ' ethnic cleansing of Muslims : the siege of Sarajevo , the concentration camps , the use of rape as a weapon of war . It was like watching `` a color remake of the black-and-white scenes we 'd seen in World War II , '' said U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke , whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power . Holbrooke was an early advocate for a U.S.-led military operation against the Bosnian Serbs . `` I took a stand that I believed was correct , '' he told Amanpour . `` I did n't think it was so controversial . '' But it would take three years -- and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica -- for Holbrooke to make his case within the Clinton administration . 1994 : Rwanda In Rwanda , where Hutu soldiers and militias massacred their Tutsi countrymen , the Clinton administration tried to avoid characterizing the ethnic slaughter as genocide . According to an internal memo , the State Department worried that under the 1948 Genocide Convention , using the term `` genocide '' could force the U.S. `` to actually ` do something . ' '' The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda , Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire , begged for additional troops . Instead of reinforcements , Dallaire got an order to withdraw completely . He would not leave Rwanda . `` I refused a legal order , '' he told Amanpour , `` but it was immoral . '' His tiny U.N. force was not enough to stop the slaughter of more than 800,000 people . 2003 : Darfur Some human rights advocates consider Darfur , the western region of Sudan , to be the scene of the first genocide of the 21st century . The atrocities in Darfur grow out of a civil war between rebels from Sudan 's African tribes and the country 's Arab-led government . In 2003 , when the rebels attacked government outposts in Darfur , a U.N. human rights monitor warned that in the `` escalating conflict , '' Sudan 's government may be `` engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur . '' At the time , world attention was on Iraq , where the United States was fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein . The early warning on Darfur `` disappeared into a big hole , '' according to Mukesh Kapila , then the U.N. 's top official in Sudan . Even when the U.N. Security Council put Darfur on its agenda , it took more than three years to authorize a robust peacekeeping force . `` There was no lack of information , '' says activist Eric Reeves . `` There was a lack of will to stop genocide .

401,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as `` a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .",What is the typical definition for marriage in the past ?,union of a man and a woman

403,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just one in 10 Latino high school dropouts earns a high school equivalency degree , compared with two in 10 African-American dropouts and three in 10 white dropouts , the Pew Hispanic Center said Thursday . The equivalency degree , called the General Educational Development -LRB- GED -RRB- credential , `` is widely regarded as the best ` second chance ' pathway to college , vocational training and military service for adults who do not graduate from high school , '' the center said on its website . Latinos also have a much higher high school drop-out rate than blacks or whites . About 41 percent of Latinos 20 and older in the United States do not have a regular high school diploma , compared with 23 percent of black adults and 14 percent of white adults , Pew said . Among Latinos , Pew noted , significant differences exist between those who were born in another country and those born in the United States . About 52 percent of foreign-born Latino adults are high school dropouts , compared with 25 percent of the native born , Pew said . Among Latino dropouts , about 21 percent of those born in the United States have a GED , compared with 5 percent of those born abroad , the research center said . A greater percentage of U.S.-born Latinos obtain GEDs because they are more aware of the opportunities available to them , said Richard Fry , the Pew Hispanic Center researcher who compiled the report . `` For the foreign-born , it takes them a little bit of time to learn about the GED , '' Fry told CNN . `` It takes a little bit of time to figure things out . '' Fry said he obtained the information by performing an analysis of newly available educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2008 American Community Survey . That Census Bureau survey was the first to differentiate between those who graduated from high school and those who obtained a GED , Fry said . Previous surveys had lumped both categories together . The Pew analysis also found that in 2008 , Latino adults with a GED had a higher unemployment rate than those with a high school diploma -- 9 percent versus 7 percent .

404,"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Italian newspaper and magazine published excerpts of what they said were audio recordings of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi talking with an escort at the center of a corruption probe . Veronica Lario , the wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , pictured , filed for divorce in May . The daily La Repubblica and its sister magazine L'Espresso said the recordings posted on their Web sites Monday were of Berlusconi and Patrizia D'Addario . She has said that an Italian businessman hired her and other women to attend parties at Berlusconi 's homes . In June , D'Addario told CNN that she had turned the tapes over to a prosecutor in Bari , southern Italy . Through her attorney , she refused to comment on the authenticity of the excerpts released Monday . But in a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA , Berlusconi lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister is challenging the `` truthfulness and legality '' of the recordings . `` We can only regard the material as worthless , completely false and the result of invention , '' Ghedini said . `` In any case , the act of its publication is an illegal act in itself , which will need to be pursued , and all legal actions will be taken against any body who publishes such material . '' Berlusconi , the 72-year-old media mogul-turned-prime minister , has denied the allegations . According to La Repubblica , the conversation between D'Addario and Berlusconi took place in October and November at the prime minister 's house in Rome . It also published an excerpt of what it said was a conversation between D'Addario and Gianpaulo Tarantini , the businessman accused of hiring D'Addario and other escorts . Prosecutors in Bari , in southern Italy , are investigating allegations that Tarantini bribed health officials to buy prosthetics and other medical supplies from a company he and his brother own . Tarantini has denied any wrongdoing and says he brought women to the parties to make a `` beautiful impression . '' `` I have never paid money to those who accompanied me except for refunding their trip expenses , '' he said in a statement issued last month . `` I exclude that the premier could have been aware of these reimbursements and I want to ask forgiveness for having involuntarily damaged him . '' Berlusconi 's private life has been in the spotlight since his wife of 19 years , Veronica Lario , filed for divorce in May . The split followed reports that Berlusconi went to the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old girl , with whom Berlusconi has denied having an inappropriate relationship . And the Spanish newspaper El Pais has published what it said were photos of racy parties at Berlusconi 's villa on the island of Sardinia , including one picture that showed scantily clad women . But despite the swirl of scandal , Berlusconi remains popular , consistently scoring approval ratings well over 50 percent .

Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on `` The Sopranos '' and played alongside Robert De Niro in `` A Bronx Tale . '' Brancato , 32 , was also acquitted of two counts of burglary , but could face three to 15 years in prison on the attempted burglary charge . He has already served three years , according to his attorney , Joseph Tacopina . Police officer Daniel Enchautegui , 28 , was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor 's house in the Bronx in December 2005 . During the trial , Brancato said there was not a break-in . Brancato said he knew the owner of the home , and that he and friend Steven Armento , 51 , were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium . Brancato told the jury that the owner , a Vietnam veteran , gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted . Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home , but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs . When Brancato and Armento entered the home , the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate . That 's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum . Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November . The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento . Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery , but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying . `` This jury spoke loud and clear , that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer , '' Tacopina said .

Embassy in Tanzania that killed 11 people faces war crimes charges , the Pentagon announced Monday . Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani is shown in a photo posted by the FBI in 2004 . The bombing in Dar es Salaam , which also wounded hundreds , was one of two carried out nearly simultaneously on August 7 , 1998 . One in Nairobi , Kenya , killed 213 people . Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , from Tanzania , faces nine charges , six of them offenses that could carry the death penalty if he is convicted by a military tribunal . He was captured by Pakistan in 2004 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . In a written announcement , the Pentagon said Ghailani is `` charged with the following substantive offenses : murder in violation of the Law of War , murder of protected persons , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and terrorism . In addition , he is charged with conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses . `` Ghailani is further charged with providing material support to terrorism . This charge alleges that after the bombing , Ghailani continued in his service to al Qaeda as a document forger , physical trainer at an al Qaeda training camp , and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden . '' The charges say he purchased bomb components , scouted the embassy with the suicide bomb driver , met with co-conspirators , and fled to Karachi , Pakistan , one day before the bombing . The convening authority for military commissions , Susan J. Crawford , will determine whether probable cause exists for a trial by military commission , said Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartman of the Office of Military Commissions . For Ghailani to ultimately be sentenced to death , the 12-member jury would have to unanimously find him guilty , determine that aggravating factors apply , and concur on the death sentence , Hartman told reporters at the Pentagon . `` Everything has to be unanimous . '' `` And then there are four levels of post-trial review , which is an extraordinary set of rights available , '' he said .

408,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ten members of an international smuggling ring have been arrested and charged with paying more than $ 500,000 in bribes to smuggle millions of dollars in fake designer goods from China to the United States , according to the U.S. Justice Department . Authorities say a sting targeted a smuggling ring pushing counterfeit goods through a New Jersey port . The defendants were expected to appear Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas . The counterfeit goods included designer jeans , Nike shoes , Burberry and Chanel handbags , and Polo and Baby Phat clothing , according to a news release from the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York . The estimated value of the genuine versions of the goods would be more than $ 200 million , prompting U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia to describe the case as `` one of the largest counterfeit smuggling cases ever brought in United States history . '' The suspects arrested Wednesday are accused of smuggling or attempting to smuggle scores of 40-foot-long shipping containers through the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Elizabeth , New Jersey , since June 2006 . The Chinese-made knockoffs were placed in containers with false bills of lading , which are the shipping documents used to determine a cargo 's point of origin and destination . `` One bill of lading claimed a container held ` noodles , ' when in fact it contained counterfeit Nike sneakers , '' the news release said . After the bogus goods cleared inspection at the New Jersey port , they were transported to New York-area warehouses , where they awaited distribution to retail customers . According to the news release , the bribes were paid directly to an undercover agent whose `` near-daily '' conversations with the suspects were secretly recorded or monitored . The undercover agent posed as a `` corrupt longshoreman 's union official , stationed at Port Newark , who had the ability to clear imported cargo through the United States customs and border security measures without detection or seizure , '' the news release said . The 10 suspects are charged with conspiring to smuggle goods into the U.S. , smuggling goods into the U.S. and trafficking in counterfeit goods , the news release states . If convicted , they face up to 35 years in prison , at least $ 2.5 million in fines and an obligation to pay restitution to the manufacturers of the genuine versions of the goods . Among those arrested in the sting were Robin Huff , 46 , of New York , a federally licensed customs broker who is accused of using a Customs and Border Patrol database to help push goods through the port . Also arrested were Chi On Wong , 36 , and Man Wai Cheng , 34 , both of New York , who operated a Brooklyn-based trucking company , KT Express Inc. . Authorities allege Wong and Cheng charged smugglers a premium to transport goods around the New York area . On Wednesday , Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents raided a house in Brooklyn used as KT Express ' base of operations and three other locations . Federal agents seized $ 80,000 in cash and two KT Express trucks allegedly used in the operation , the news release said . Also arrested Wednesday were : • Grace Quezon , 38 , of Jersey City , New Jersey , who is alleged to have paid at least $ 400,000 to the undercover agent . She also is accused of smuggling or attempting to smuggle more than 25 containers of counterfeit goods . • Michael Chu , 70 , of New York , who is accused of paying more than $ 100,000 to the undercover agent and smuggling more than 20 containers through the port . • Hsi Feng Li , 61 , of New York , aka `` the General , '' who is accused of telling the federal agent he could send the agent 50 containers of bogus goods a month . • Yee Khiong Ting , 44 , of New York , who is accused of coordinating shipments , paying bribes to the federal agent and selling the goods once they cleared customs . • Troy King , 37 , of New York , who allegedly worked with Chu and Quezon , and whom authorities accuse of arranging payments and overseeing operations . • Wing Ki Lee , 36 , of Jersey City , who is accused of working with King to smuggle containers into the U.S. on behalf of a Chinese manufacturer who was a primary supplier of the counterfeit merchandise . • Dick Ong , 57 , of Bergenfield , New Jersey , who is accused of tracking containers , arranging pickups and monitoring the status of containers that moved through the New Jersey port .

The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset , the country 's national parliament , located in Jerusalem , which Israel claims as its capital . The Knesset 's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote . Knesset seats are divided according to each party 's proportion of the overall vote . But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat . Participation in elections , including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population , has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout , according to Israeli government figures . Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters . Israel usually holds national elections every four years . But this year 's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni 's failure to form a coalition . Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim . Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel ; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself .

The attack on Samarra 's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites . Haitham Sabah al-Badri , the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra , was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra , said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference . `` Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra , '' Fox said . `` We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq . '' Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri , according to a U.S. military news release . During the raid , at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces , the release said . The coalition forces called in close air support , killing al-Badri and the three others , the release said . One of those killed was identified as a foreigner ; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives , the military said . El-Badri 's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official . No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque , one of the holiest Shiite sites , but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17 1/2 months since the attack . In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque 's dome , another bombing in June destroyed the shrine 's two remaining minarets . Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks , including two last year , Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers . Samarra is in Salaheddin province , north of Baghdad .

417,"DURBAN , South Africa -- India 's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket 's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday . Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad Paul Collingwood 's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban . England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians , who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday 's must-win clash with the hosts . Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history , needing just 12 deliveries , as India made 218-4 . The left-hander 's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket . South Africa 's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year , while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches . Singh 's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over , in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once . Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls , putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir , who hit 58 off 41 deliveries . Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs , while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45 . In reply , England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs . Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls , and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries , but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh . Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs , while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28 . If India can beat South Africa , it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through . The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand , who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat . South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday , then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89 . Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs . He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings , having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2 . Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs -LRB- 19 -RRB- before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher . Boucher departed for 23 , caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie , who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs . The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp , and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory . The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis , hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday 's five-run win against England . McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent , scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel 's four victims . Morkel , who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs , then removed Ross Taylor -LRB- 1 -RRB- two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15 . He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher , and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove .

420,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She had many plans for the future : to go to college , start a career , meet the man of her dreams , raise a family -- when the time was right . Expert : `` There 's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value . '' It was all cut off by an unexpected pregnancy . The baby became her life , consuming her energy and forcing her dreams to the back burner of her life . She is 19 or younger and Latina , and has had her first baby . It 's not what she wanted . Nor did her parents , who are the greatest influence on her decisions about sex , according to a wide-ranging survey released Tuesday by experts on the Hispanic community in the United States . The survey also found that 84 percent of Latino teens and 91 percent of Latino parents believe that graduating from college or university or having a promising career is the most important goal for a teen 's future . Somewhere along the way , the aspirations fail to match up to reality . The survey attempts to examine some of the reasons for the disparity and why Latinas now have the highest teen birth rate among all ethnic and racial groups in the United States . `` There 's a big disconnect between pregnancy rates and what Latina families want and value , '' said Ruthie Flores , senior manager of the National Campaign 's Latino Initiative . According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , 53 percent of Latinas get pregnant in their teens , about twice the national average . After a period of decline , the birth rate for U.S. teenagers 15 to 19 years rose in 2007 by about 1 percent , to 42.5 births per 1,000 , according to preliminary data in a March 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's National Center for Health Statistics . In 2007 , the birth rate among non-Hispanic whites ages 15 to 19 was 27.2 per 1,000 , and 64.3 per 1,000 for non-Hispanic black teens in the same age range . The teen birth rate among Hispanic teens ages 15 to 19 was 81.7 per 1,000 . Of the 759 Latino teens surveyed , 49 percent said their parents most influenced their decisions about sex , compared with 14 percent who cited friends . Three percent cited religious leaders , 2 percent teachers and 2 percent the media . Watch more on the survey results '' Three-quarters of Latino teens said their parents have talked to them about sex and relationships , but only half said their parents discussed contraception . The survey also found that : • 74 percent of Latino teens believe that parents send one message about sex to their sons and a different message altogether to their daughters , possibly related to the Latino value of machismo . • Latino teens believe that the most common reason teens do not use contraception is that they are afraid their parents might find out . • 72 percent of sexually experienced teens say they wish they had waited . • 34 percent of Latino teens believe that being a teen parent would prevent them from reaching their goals , but 47 percent say being a teen parent would simply delay them from reaching their goals . • 76 percent said it is important to be married before starting a family . Flores said it is crucial to understand the beliefs and attitudes that influence teen behavior in order to reduce the high rates of Hispanic teen pregnancy . The survey , co-sponsored by the Hispanic advocacy group National Council of La Raza , was an attempt to to do just that . She said that despite a rich culture and the growing influence of Hispanics in America , the Latino community disproportionately suffers from troubling social indicators . Consider that fewer than six in 10 Latino adults in the United States have a high school diploma . Latino teens are more likely to drop out than their non-Hispanic counterparts , and of all the children living in poverty , 30 percent are Latino . `` Teen pregnancy is not an isolated issue , '' Flores said . `` It 's related to poverty , to dropout rates . That 's going to have an impact on our national as a whole . '' Flores said 69 percent of Latino teen moms drop out of high school , and the children of teen mothers are less likely to do well in school themselves and often repeat grades . `` That has a big economic impact , '' Flores said . It 's an impact that is sure to be noticed . The nation 's 45 million Latinos constitute the largest minority group in the United States with a growth rate twice that of the general population . That means by 2025 , one-quarter of all American teens will be Latinos .",What percentage of Latina 's are pregnant by their 20th birthday ?,53 percent
425,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Veteran goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt has received his first international call-up since 2003 as Germany coach Joachim Low named seven players from Bayern Munich in a preliminary 27-man squad for the World Cup in South Africa . The 35-year-old Butt will be competing for a starting place with Schalke 's Manuel Neuer and Werder Bremen 's Tim Wiese as Bayer Leverkusen 's Rene Adler has been ruled out with a rib injury . Captain Michael Ballack , who plays for English club Chelsea , is the only man selected who does not feature in the German Bundesliga . Stuttgart 's Brazil-born forward Cacau is included , but his former clubmate Thomas Hitzlsperger misses out despite the absence of injured Leverkusen midfielder Simon Rolfes as he has not been playing regularly for his Italian club Lazio . `` This was a very difficult decision for me , '' Low told reporters on Thursday . `` Thomas has never disappointed us and made a key contribution in helping us qualify . `` He is a reliable player , but he barely played in the last few months before he left Stuttgart and has also played very little at Lazio . '' Low will reduce the squad to 23 by the June 1 deadline for submission ahead of the tournament 's kick-off 10 days later . Butt , who has won three caps , will not be able to feature in next Thursday 's friendly against Malta as he will be needed by Bayern in the German Cup final against Bremen in Berlin on May 15 . His clubmates Holger Badstuber , Mario Gomez , Miroslav Klose , Philipp Lahm , Thomas Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger will also sit out the Malta game in Aachen along with Bremen 's Wiese , Per Mertesacker , Marko Marin and Mesut Ozil . The 21-year-old Badstuber has yet to win a cap for Germany and made his senior debut for Bayern in the first game of this season , covering at left-back despite being a central defender . Attacking midfielder Muller , 20 , will seek to add to his sole cap after also impressing this season , scoring the first hat-trick of his career in the 3-1 win over Bochum last weekend which effectively gave Bayern the league title . Ballack will also be away playing for Chelsea in the FA Cup final on May 15 , before joining the squad in Sicily with the Werder quartet , while the Bayern players will not be in camp until after the Champions League final on May 22 . Bayern , who had eight players in the squad that finished third on home soil four years ago , can complete the first leg of a potential treble by clinching the Bundesliga title this weekend , when Louis Van Gaal 's side face bottom club Hertha Berlin . Germany will face Hungary in Budapest on May 29 and then Bosnia-Herzegovina in Frankfurt on June 3 before heading to South Africa .

429,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- England coach Fabio Capello has been forced to go back on his previously iron-clad rules in selecting his preliminary squad for the World Cup in South Africa . The Italian has always said he would not pick players who are injured or out of form , but has brought Liverpool 's Jamie Carragher out of international retirement to bolster his defensive options as cover with injury-prone captain Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King also in the 30-man line-up . Neither Carragher nor versatile Tottenham star King have yet played for Capello , who retained his midfield mainstay Gareth Barry despite the Manchester City player being in doubt for the June 12 opener against the United States due to injury . Carragher made himself unavailable in 2007 after not being often used by previous managers Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren despite being regularly named in squads . Blog : Will `` the Force '' be with Capello at World Cup ? Capello also asked Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes to become available again following his own international retirement in 2004 , but the 35-year-old turned down the opportunity . `` He said no , he preferred to stay with the family . But I tried , '' Capello told the UK Press Association . Liverpool fullback Glen Johnson was named despite being sidelined with injury , while striker Emile Heskey retained his place although he has not been a first-choice selection for his club Aston Villa . Key forward Wayne Rooney was named despite his niggling groin problem , with Tottenham 's Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch taking the other striking spots along with Sunderland 's 25-goal Darren Bent . Winger Aaron Lennon was included after only recently returning with Tottenham after a long-term absence , as was fellow right-sided player Shaun Wright-Phillips despite his failure to win a regular place at Manchester City , who also have 22-year-old Adam Johnson in the squad . Midfielder Joe Cole also got the nod , having last played for England in 2008 , after a strong end to a season that saw him on the fringe of league champions Chelsea 's first team . Italy 's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi has stuck with the players who qualified for South Africa in his 30-man squad , resisting suggestions that he should bring in-form Roma striker Francesco Totti out of international retirement . Totti 's on-loan teammate Luca Toni also missed out along with veteran Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero , with Villarreal 's Giuseppe Rossi one of seven strikers named . Inter Milan 's controversial Italy under-21 forward Mario Balotelli missed out as Fabio Quagliarella -LRB- Napoli -RRB- , Vincenzo Iaquinta -LRB- Juventus -RRB- , Antonio Di Natale -LRB- Udinese -RRB- , Marco Borriello -LRB- Milan -RRB- , Alberto Gilardino -LRB- Fiorentina -RRB- and Giampaolo Pazzini -LRB- Sampdoria -RRB- were picked . Lippi omitted his former Juventus player Nicola Legrottaglie despite the defender being included in a recent 29-man training squad . France coach Raymond Domenech left out young Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema in his 30-man selection , while the omission of veteran midfielder Patrick Vieira means Thierry Henry is the only survivor from the 1998 World Cup-winning squad . Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri also missed out , but four of his clubmates in England -- Gael Clichy , William Gallas , Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna -- were included . However , defender Gallas has been warned by Domenech that he must prove his fitness , having been sidelined since March with a leg injury . Veteran Netherlands striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy has missed out on a place in coach Bert van Marwijk 's 30-man , potentially signaling the end of the 33-year-old 's international career . Van Nistelrooy left Real Madrid to join German club Hamburg to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury , but Van Marwijk said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected . `` I told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the World Cup , '' Van Marwijk told AD Sportwereld . `` I believe that Ruud is fit , but after his lengthy knee injury he does not have time to get back to his old level . '' Dutch champions Twente have only two players in the squad , which features 14 overseas-based names . Feyenoord defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst , 35 , has announced he will retire after the month-long tournament . Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz named a 24-man squad due to doubts over a couple of players including Real Madrid defender Pepe , who has only just returned to training after being sidelined since December . Goalkeepers Beto and Daniel Fernandes were named as deputies to Braga 's Eduardo despite not playing in any of the qualifiers , but there were no other surprises for the 2006 semifinalists , who will be led by Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo . Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is giving injured stars Andreas Iniesta , Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas every chance to be fit , naming the key trio in a 30-man squad including five goalkeepers . Uncapped Barcelona No. 1 Victor Valdes and Atletico Madrid 's 19-year-old David De Gea were selected along with Real Madrid 's Iker Casillas , Liverpool 's Jose Reina and Diego Lopez of Villarreal . Barcelona winger Pedro Rodriguez , Osasuna defender Cesar Azpilicueta and Athletic Bilbao midfielder Javi Martinez were named despite having won only under-21 caps . Barca 19-year-old Bojan Krkic , who missed Spain 's Euro 2008 success at his own request due to fatigue , has again been omitted . Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel , Filip Holosko and fellow striker Robert Vittek were named in a 29-man squad by coach Vladimir Weiss despite their recent injury problems . Liverpool 's Skrtel has not played for three months since breaking a bone in his foot , while Holosko is struggling to get over a broken leg suffered last year and Vittek -- who is also based in Turkey -- has had a knee problem . Weiss also selected his 20-year-old son and namesake Vladimir of English club Manchester City , who as loaned to Bolton this season . Serbia coach Radomir Antic named just five home-based players in his 30-man squad , with six from English Premier League clubs including key defender Nemanja Vidic of Manchester United . Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek kept faith with the players who helped the small East European nation qualify for the second time when he named his 30-man squad . Denmark coach Morten Olsen picked Thomas Sorensen in his 26-man squad despite the goalkeeper suffered a dislocated elbow on duty with English club Stoke last month . Olsen , who won more than 100 caps as a player and took Denmark to the 2002 World Cup , gave defender Patrick Mtiliga his first call-up since his debut in November 2008 . Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has picked Christos Patsatzoglou and Giorgos Seitaridis despite the duo 's struggles with injuries this season . The German selected nine overseas-based players including qualifying campaign top scorer Theofanis Gekas of Hertha Berlin , Celtic striker Georgios Samaras and Liverpool defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos . Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld named an experienced 23-man squad for the finals , with seven players in reserve . The German has stuck with the likes of Blaise Nkufo of Dutch champions Twente , fellow striker Alexander Frei and midfielder Hakin Yakin , who are all 30 and above . Defender Philippe Senderos was included despite his lack of action with English club Arsenal , while Sampdoria midfielder Marco Padalino and Kosovo-born Swiss under-21 international Xherdan Shaqiri were also included .",who is Italy coach ?,Marcelo Lippi
431,"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraq 's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday tried to allay Iranian fears over a planned U.S.-Iraq security pact , saying his government would not allow Iraq to become a launching pad for an attack on its neighbor . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , left , greets Iraq 's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday . `` Iraq today does n't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime , '' al-Maliki told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a Sunday meeting between two leaders , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office . `` Today 's Iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law , and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect , '' al-Maliki said . Earlier , Iran 's state-run news agency IRNA quoted the Iraqi leader as saying that `` Baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries , including Iran . '' His remarks come as the United States and Iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the U.S. military will remain in Iraq and what role it will play in Iraq 's security . But al-Maliki media adviser Ali Hadi said negotiations between Iraq and the United States are in their `` very early stages '' and were not part of Sunday 's talks . Watch Ahmadinejad and al-Maliki sit down for talks '' `` The treaty is purely an Iraqi-American treaty . The Iranians have nothing to do with it , '' Hadi said . `` We will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an Iraqi issue . '' The proposed U.S.-Iraqi pact has triggered street protests in Iraq , where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent American bases , a long-term presence of U.S. troops and a weakening of Iraqi government control over those troops . Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , whose militia was the target of a U.S.-backed Iraqi clampdown in Basra and Baghdad recently , has called for weekly protests against the agreement . Al-Maliki and Ahmadinejad met Sunday afternoon , with Ahmadinejad calling on Iraq 's neighbors and the United Nations to help restore security and stability to Iraq , IRNA reported . And al-Maliki thanked Ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding U.N. sanctions against Iraq that date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf war . Iran has long called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , which the United States invaded in 2003 . Meanwhile , the United States has accused Iran of arming and training `` criminal '' Shiite militias in Iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , allegations the Iranians deny . It is al-Maliki 's third visit to Iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago . The two countries , which are neighbors , both have Shiite Muslim majorities , and al-Maliki 's ruling coalition is dominated by Shiite religious parties long backed by Iran . Adnan Pachachi , a leading Sunni Arab member of Iraq 's parliament , told CNN he wanted al-Maliki to call on Iran to stop supporting armed factions in Iraq . `` I think this has to stop , '' Pachachi told CNN . `` I hope that Mr. Maliki will make it absolutely clear that Iraqis of all parties , of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins , are strongly opposed to Iran 's attempt to interfere in Iraq 's affairs . '' Pachachi , a former foreign minister , said al-Maliki 's predecessor , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , allowed Iraq 's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias , and that U.S. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out . `` In the long run , it is in the interest of the United States to have a secure Iraq and armed forces and security forces of Iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties , '' he said .",who is al-maliki,Iraq 's Prime Minister
433,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. soldier convicted of rape and murder two decades ago will be executed December 10 in the nation 's first military execution since 1961 , the Army said Thursday . Pvt. Ronald Gray has been on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , since 1988 . A court-martial panel sitting at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , unanimously convicted him of committing two murders and other crimes in the Fayetteville , North Carolina , area , and sentenced him to death . Gray 's execution by injection will be carried out by Fort Leavenworth soldiers at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute , Indiana , the Army said in a news release . Gray was convicted of raping and killing a female Army private and a civilian near his post at Fort Bragg . He was also convicted of the rape and attempted murder of another fellow soldier in her barracks at the post . Both military and civilian courts found Gray responsible for the crimes , which were committed between April 1986 and January 1987 . Gray pleaded guilty to two murders and five rapes in a civilian court and was sentenced to three consecutive and five concurrent life terms . The general court-martial at Fort Bragg then tried him and in April 1988 convicted him of two murders , an attempted murder and three rapes . In July , President George W. Bush approved the Army 's request to execute Gray . `` The president took action following completion of a full appellate process , which upheld the conviction and sentence to death , '' the Army said in the news release . `` Two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied during the appellate processing of Pvt.

436,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver , the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics , died Tuesday , the Special Olympics said . She was 88 . Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006 . Born on July 10 , 1921 , in Brookline , Massachusetts , Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy . She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics , which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962 . Today , 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations , according to the Special Olympics . `` She was the light of our lives , a mother , wife , grandmother , sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others , '' the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement . `` For each of us , she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games , to visit us in our homes , to attend to her own mother , her sisters and brothers , and to sail , tell stories , and laugh and serve her friends . '' No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements , a source close to the family said . Shriver 's husband , R. Sargent Shriver , and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died , the Special Olympics said in a statement . Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver 's life '' `` We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder , '' Brady Lum , Special Olympics president and chief operating officer , said in a statement Tuesday . `` Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement . It is an enormous loss , but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family , friends , and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed . '' Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968 , Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector . She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets . In September 1962 , Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister , Rosemary , which was published in The Saturday Evening Post . At an event honoring her in 2007 , Shriver spoke of her life : `` Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities . `` As important as it has been , it is not the whole story of my life . My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities . It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children . ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband . '' Watch Shriver reflect on her life '' At the same event , Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister , saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents , including compassion . `` She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind . She picked this up , obviously , at a very early age . All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary . '' After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945 , helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life . From 1947 to 1948 , she worked for $ 1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency .

She married Sargent Shriver Jr. , a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant , in 1953 . The couple 's five children include California 's first lady , Maria Shriver . Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s , including Head Start and the Peace Corps . He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics . He ran President Johnson 's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 . He was Democrat George McGovern 's running mate in the 1972 presidential election . In 1957 , Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. . Foundation , which was established in 1946 to honor the family 's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people . Watch Shriver receive a special honor '' Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy . In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children , adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008 . Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s , Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp , called Camp Shriver , on her farm in Maryland . Her vision expanded over the years , and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago . She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States , including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971 . In 1981 , Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers . That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006 . Along the way , Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards , including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame 's Founder 's Award and nine honorary degrees . In 1995 , the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait . The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin . In 2009 , a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery .

442,"LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Farrah Fawcett has been hospitalized in the latest stage of her battle against cancer , a producer working with the actress said Monday . Farrah Fawcett , shown here in 2004 , was first diagnosed with cancer in 2006 . `` She is not unconscious , she is not unresponsive , and she is not comatose , '' Craig Nevius told CNN . He added that Fawcett `` is surrounded by family and friends . '' She `` has a real iron will '' and is `` a fighter , '' he said . Nevius has been working with the 62-year-old on a documentary about her fight with cancer . Earlier , he told People magazine that Fawcett had checked into '' a Los Angeles hospital . '' Fawcett was diagnosed in 2006 . People magazine reported that she has anal cancer . Early in 2007 , Fawcett said she was told her cancer had gone into remission . Her official Web site has posts from February , 2007 celebrating the news . But the cancer returned later that year . Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts and commercials , and as `` Six Million Dollar Man '' actor Lee Majors ' wife , when she shot a best-selling pinup poster in early 1976 at the behest of a Cleveland , Ohio , company called Pro Arts . Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away . The poster , with Fawcett 's million-dollar smile front and center and right nipple obvious through the fabric of her red bathing suit , became a sensation . Soon after the photo shoot , Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show , `` Charlie 's Angels , '' about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie . Fawcett , who played Jill Munroe , was the last to be cast -- co-star Kate Jackson was the known name at the time -- but , thanks to her poster , Fawcett became the series ' breakout star . The highly rated TV series kicked off what came to be known as `` jiggle TV , '' series full of young actresses who appeared in bikinis at the drop of a hat . `` Denunciations of ` massage parlor television ' and ` voyeurism ' only brought more viewers to the screen , to see what the controversy was about , '' wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in their exhaustive reference , `` The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows . '' `` Charlie 's Angels '' turned out to be a huge hit , and shows ranging from the sitcom `` Three 's Company '' to the drama `` Baywatch '' owe the show a debt . Fawcett did n't stay with `` Angels '' long . At the end of the first season , unhappy with her contract , she left the show , replaced by Cheryl Ladd . Fawcett 's career stagnated for a time after `` Charlie 's Angels , '' as she appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors . But her career received a major boost with her starring role in `` The Burning Bed , '' a 1984 made-for-television movie co-starring Paul LeMat . In the film , Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband 's bed as he lies sleeping . Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance . Around that time , Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O'Neal , with whom she had a son , Redmond , in 1985 . Redmond O'Neal was arrested Sunday morning for narcotics possession . In recent years , Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye . She posed nude for Playboy in 1995 . In 1997 , she appeared on `` The Late Show with David Letterman , '' an interview that became notorious for Fawcett 's apparent incoherence . She later said she was just having fun with Letterman . She reunited with her `` Charlie 's Angels '' co-stars , Jackson and Jaclyn Smith , for an awards-show appearance in 2006 . Fawcett has been making a documentary , `` A Wing and a Prayer , '' for NBC about her cancer battle . `` She is an icon , and you do n't become an icon by being weak , '' Nevius said Monday . `` All you have to do is look back at her 30-year-plus career to see that she is not somebody that has ever stepped down or backed down from a challenge of any kind .

447,"-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Having a disease named after you is a decidedly mixed bag . On the one hand , your scientific developments are forever commemorated . On the other hand , though , you 're stuck with the knowledge that no patient will ever be happy upon hearing your name . Who are the scientists and doctors behind some of our most famous diseases and conditions , though ? Here are a few of the physicians and their eponymous ailments : 1 . Crohn 's disease The inflammatory digestive disease could just have easily ended up with the name Ginzburg 's disease or Oppenheimer 's disease . In 1932 , three New York physicians named Burrill Bernard Crohn , Leon Ginzburg , and Gordon Oppenheimer published a paper describing a new sort of intestinal inflammation . Since Crohn 's name was listed first alphabetically , the condition ended up bearing his name . 2 . Salmonellosis Yes , the salmonella menace that haunts undercooked chicken is named after a person . Daniel Elmer Salmon was a veterinary pathologist who ran a USDA microorganism research program during the late 19th century . Although Salmon did n't actually discover the type of bacterium that now bears his name -- famed epidemiologist Theobald Smith isolated the bacteria in 1885 -- he ran the research program in which the discovery occurred . Smith and his colleagues named the bacteria salmonella in honor of their boss . Mental Floss : Margherita pizza , other foods named after people 3 . Parkinson 's disease James Parkinson was a busy fellow . While the English apothecary had a booming medical business , he also dabbled in geology , paleontology , and politics ; Parkinson even published a three-volume scientific study of fossils . Following a late-18th-century foray into British politics where he advocated a number of social causes and found himself briefly ensnared in an alleged plot to assassinate King George III , Parkinson turned his attention to medicine . Parkinson did some research on gout and peritonitis , but it was his landmark 1817 study `` An Essay on the Shaking Palsy '' that affixed his name to Parkinson 's disease . 4 . Huntington 's disease George Huntington was n't the most prolific researcher , but he made his papers count . In 1872 , a fresh-out-of-med-school Huntington published one of two research papers he would write in his life . In the paper , Huntington described the effects of the neurodegenerative disorder that now bears his name after examining several generations of family that all suffered from the genetic condition . 5 . Alzheimer 's disease In 1901 , German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer began observing an odd patient at a Frankfurt asylum . The 51-year-old woman , Mrs. Auguste Deter , had no short-term memory and behaved strangely . When Mrs. Deter died in 1906 , Alzheimer began to dissect the patient 's brain , and he presented his findings that November in what was the first formal description of presenile dementia . Mental Floss : 4 people with super memory 6 . Tourette syndrome Credit George Gilles de la Tourette for his modesty . When the French neurologist first described the illness that now bears his name in 1884 , he did n't name it after himself . Instead , he referred to the condition as `` maladie des tics . '' Tourette 's mentor and contemporary Jean-Martin Charcot renamed the illness after Tourette . Tourette did n't have such great luck with patients , though . In 1893 , a deluded former patient shot the doctor in the head . The woman claimed that she lost her sanity after Tourette hypnotized her . Tourette survived the attack . 7 . Hodgkin 's lymphoma British pathologist Thomas Hodgkin first described the cancer that now bears his name while working at Guy 's Hospital in London in 1832 . Hodgkin published the study `` On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent Glands and Spleen '' that year , but the condition did n't bear his name until a fellow physician , Samuel Wilks , rediscovered Hodgkin 's work . 8 . Bright 's disease The kidney disease bears the name of Richard Bright , an English physician and colleague of Hodgkin 's at Guy 's Hospital . Bright began looking into the causes of kidney trouble during the 1920s , and in 1927 he described an array of kidney ailments that eventually became known as Bright 's disease . Today , doctors understand many of the symptoms historically clumped together as Bright 's disease are in fact different maladies , so the term is rarely used . 9 . Addison 's disease Guy 's Hospital was apparently the place to work in the 19th century if you wanted to have a disease named after you . Thomas Addison , a colleague of Bright and Hodgkin at Guy 's Hospital , first described the adrenal disorder we call Addison 's disease in 1855 . On top of this discovery , Addison also published an early study of appendicitis . Mental Floss : 11 celebrities who overcame dyslexia 10 . Tay-Sachs disease Although both of their names are attached to this genetic disorder , Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs did n't work together . In fact , they did n't even work in the same country . Tay , a British opthalmologist , first described the disease 's characteristic red spot on the retina in 1881 . In 1887 Bernard Sachs , a colleague of Burrill Crohn at Mount Sinai Hospital , described the cellular effects of the disease and its prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews . 11 . Turner syndrome The chromosomal disorder got its name from Oklahoma doctor Henry Turner , who first described the condition in 1938 . 12 . Klinefelter 's syndrome The genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome bears the name of Harry Klinefelter , a young Boston endocrinologist who published a landmark study while working under the tutelage of endocrinology star Dr. Fuller Albright in 1942 . Albright pushed his young protégé to be the lead author of the paper that described the condition , so the young Klinefelter 's name is forever associated with the syndrome . 13 . Asperger 's syndrome Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger first described the syndrome that now bears his name in 1944 after observing a group of over 400 children who suffered from what Asperger described as `` autistic psychopathy . '' Interestingly , since Asperger 's research was all written in German , his contributions to the literature went unrecognized until much later . The term `` Asperger 's syndrome '' did n't come into widespread usage until 1981 . For more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com",Who describes autism in 1944 ?,Hans Asperger
448,"LA PAZ , Bolivia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bolivian officials have declared a health emergency after three deaths attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever , the often-lethal form of a mosquito-borne disease that more than 1,000 Bolivians are thought to have contracted since November . Brazilian soldiers pour insecticide to fight dengue fever in 2008 . Bolivia also is battling the mosquito-borne disease . At least 12 unconfirmed instances of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the first 17 days of 2009 , the official ABI news agency said . About 250 cases of dengue fever , the milder , nonlethal form of the disease , have been confirmed in the past two weeks , said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia in the Los Tiempos de Cochabamba newspaper . Authorities said they have committed more than 20,000 military personnel and 2.5 tons of insecticide to combat the disease . A preteen boy died last week at Children 's Hospital of La Paz , a few days after arriving with internal bleeding , hospital director Christian Fuentes told La Razon newspaper in La Paz , the nation 's capital . `` By that time , there was nothing we could do . He had multiple internal hemorrhages , '' Fuentes said . A 17-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman also died last week , the ABI news agency said , citing the national director of epidemiology , Juan Carlos Arraya . Cases of dengue fever usually spike from November through January , which is Bolivia 's hot and rainy season . Alberto Nogales , the country 's vice minister of health , said the fight against mosquitoes will last until April . Dengue occurs in tropical and subtropical parts of the world , transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of four dengue viruses , the World Health Organization says . Symptoms , which appear three to 14 days after the bite , can include mild to high fever , severe headache , pain behind the eyes , muscle and joint pain and a rash , the WHO says . Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially fatal complication that affects mainly children , the WHO says . Symptoms include fever , abdominal pain , vomiting and bleeding . The disease can not be transmitted directly from one person to another . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are up to 100 million cases worldwide each year . `` It actually is quite common , '' Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC told CNN last year . `` And unfortunately , over the last 30 years or so we 've seen an increase in the number of countries infected with dengue fever . '' Khan attributes the increase in part to population growth . Mosquitoes that carry dengue typically breed in areas near humans . `` This is a disease that occurs where there 's lots of population , '' he said . The WHO says mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in exposed water , including places as shallow as jars , discarded bottles and plant saucers . Last year , 55,000 people in southeastern Brazil contracted the disease . The outbreak was confirmed as causing the deaths of at least 67 people -- almost half of them children under 13 -- and another 58 deaths were under investigation last summer , the Rio de Janeiro state 's ministry of health reported at the time .

453,"DUBAI , United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on Tuesday accused the international media of `` exaggerating '' the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and Somalia . Refugees from Darfur gather at a camp in Chad . Sudan 's president says the crisis in Darfur is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir spoke at a news conference in Dubai following a three-day visit to the Persian Gulf emirate . He said the crisis in Sudan 's western Darfur region is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir 's government has been blamed by the United Nations of supporting militias that conduct `` indiscriminate attacks '' on civilians in the Darfur region , including torture , rape , and killings . Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the U.N. of widespread human rights abuses . During Tuesday 's news conference , el-Bashir restated his position that foreign intervention in Darfur was an obstacle in achieving peace in the region . The Sudanese president has been outspoken in his opposition to allowing non-African forces in Darfur . At the start of this year , more than 9,000 members of a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering . The force will eventually number 26,000 . Speaking on Tuesday , el-Bashir said that the fighting only affects 10 percent of the region . In the majority of Darfur , there is little to no conflict and people are living normal lives , he said . Citing Sudanese government statistics , el-Bashir said that less than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and less than 500,000 have been displaced . International figures , including United Nations ' data , put the death toll in Darfur at approximately 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced by the violence since 2003 . The conflict started five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government . Sudan 's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing the tribal militias known as janjaweed , which have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur 's local communities . El-Bashir , however , rejected claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines .

458,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hurricane Ida moved into the southern Gulf of Mexico Sunday , prompting a declaration of emergency in Louisiana and concern along the U.S. Gulf Coast . The storm regained hurricane intensity overnight Saturday , becoming a Category 2 hurricane , but forecasters said it is expected to weaken as it moves north . Ida drenched Nicaragua after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane , then weakened to a tropical storm before resuming strength . In El Salvador , at least 91 people died in flooding and mudslides , according to the government , but a low-pressure system out of the Pacific -- not Hurricane Ida -- triggered the disaster , forecaster Robby Berg of the National Hurricane Center said Sunday . A hurricane warning , meaning hurricane conditions are possible within 24 hours , extends from Pascagoula , Mississippi to Indian Pass , Florida , forecasters said . From Grande Isle , Louisiana , to west of Pascagoula , Mississippi , a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect . This area includes New Orleans , which the center earlier excluded from the watch , and Lake Pontchartrain , the hurricane center said . In anticipation of the storm 's arrival , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon . Hurricane Ida `` threatens the safety and security of those citizens '' along the state 's southeast coastline , he wrote in the declaration . The declaration gives the director of the governor 's office of emergency preparedness authority `` to undertake any activity authorized by law which he deems necessary and appropriate '' to prepare for the possibility of a hurricane . Track Ida 's progress , potential path Alabama 's Baldwin County commission urged that residents living in mobile homes , coastal communities or low-lying , flood-prone areas voluntarily evacuate . The county is under a local state of emergency and opened a shelter , according to a Sunday night statement from the county commission . As of 10 p.m. ET Sunday , Ida had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph -LRB- 165 km/hr -RRB- with higher gusts . But the storm was expected to weaken on Monday and possibly begin losing tropical characteristics on Tuesday , the hurricane center said . The center of Ida was located about 400 miles -LRB- 645 km -RRB- south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River , forecasters said . It was moving north-northwest at nearly 14 mph -LRB- 22 km/hr -RRB- and was expected to increase in speed . The storm was expected to be near coastal areas of the northern Gulf by Monday night or early Tuesday , the hurricane center said . As Ida moves in the Gulf of Mexico , conditions are expected to be unfavorable for any additional development , said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen . Ida is expected to weaken because of a combination of wind shear , cooler water temperatures and the storm 's interaction with a strong frontal system pushing off the Gulf Coast , he said . But Ida is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves in the northern Gulf toward the U.S. coast , the center said . Florida 's Division of Emergency Management asked residents to have disaster plans in place . `` Whether Ida maintains a storm or loses tropical characteristics , the Florida Gulf Coast region has the potential to see several inches of rain , strong winds , isolated tornadoes and dangerous surf and coastal flooding beginning Monday evening and continuing into Wednesday , '' the office said in a statement . The area stretching from Indian Pass , Florida , to Aucilla River , Florida , is also under a tropical storm warning . Tropical storm conditions are possible within 24 hours , the center said . Ida could drop between 1 and 3 inches of rain on portions of western Cuba , with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some spots , forecasters said . The central and eastern areas of the Gulf Coast northward to eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian Mountains could see 3 to 5 inches of rain with some areas getting as much as 8 inches , the center said . Ida is the Atlantic region 's ninth named storm . The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30 .

463,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April , according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization . A young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi . Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week . As of July 31 , the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus , also known as swine flu , stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO 's previous update on July 27 . The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed , spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months , according to WHO . WHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380 , but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported . The total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168 , with new cases reported in Azerbaijan , Gabon , Grenada , Kazakhstan , Moldova , Monaco , Nauru , Swaziland and Suriname . In the United States , federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season . They say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus , but it wo n't be as simple as a single shot . In a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday , two senior administration officials said the vaccine , which is still in clinical trials , would require two shots . The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later . Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that . That means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October wo n't get protection until late fall . On Tuesday , British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies . GlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $ 250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization . `` First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards , with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 , '' GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement . `` The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain . '' Details of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government 's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season . The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain , identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations . The priority groups include pregnant women , health care and emergency services personnel , children , adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age , household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions . The symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever , cough , sore throat , aches and runny nose , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting .",How many Americans will be vaccinated ?,160 million Americans may need to

466,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The average cost of medical care for a premature or low birth-weight baby for its first year of life is about $ 49,000 , according to a new report from the March of Dimes Foundation . Babies born after the 37th week of pregnancy are less costly to the health care system than premature babies . By contrast , a newborn without complications costs $ 4,551 for care in its first year of life , the report said . Newborns with other kinds of complications , such as congenital defects , have medical expenses of $ 10,273 on average in the first year . The foundation wants to show employers the importance of good maternity care , maternity coverage , and prevention of prematurity , said Jennifer Howse , president of the March of Dimes , a nonprofit for pregnancy and baby health . `` It 's in the best interest of the bottom line for the employer , and of course it 's certainly in the best interest for the baby , the employee , and ultimately the community in which the business is located , '' she said . Although most of these costs go straight to the health care plans , even out-of-pocket expenses are far greater for premature babies than for children delivered at a normal time . The average out-of-pocket expense for a premature or low-birth-weight baby in the first year was $ 1,987 . For uncomplicated births , it is $ 654 , and a baby with other kinds of complications averages $ 953 in out of pocket expenses . But it 's important to note that these are average costs for premature babies born at different times -- a baby born closer to 40 weeks will most likely cost much less than a baby born at 26 weeks , said William Sexson , neonatologist at Emory University and prematurity prevention chair for the March of Dimes for the state of Georgia . Sexson was not involved in the new report . The problem of prematurity By definition , a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy . About 12 percent of all pregnancies in the United States result in premature birth , according to the National Institutes of Health . A low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 2,500 grams , or 5.5 pounds . Prematurity may contribute to problems such as cerebral palsy , vision problems , learning disabilities , and developmental delays , experts say . The rate of premature babies in the United States has increased 36 percent since the early 1980s , the March of Dimes said . One reason for the abundance of premature births may be the increasing number of elective early deliveries , said Sexson . There is a lack of transparency about both patients ' and obstetricians ' decisions to , for example , have a Caesarean section close to term -- technically premature . The March of Dimes recommends every elective delivery before 39 weeks be reviewed . `` There is a real concern that many of those deliveries are a lot more elective than they ought to be , '' Sexson said . Uncomplicated Caesarean deliveries cost over 40 percent more than uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , the new report said . These deliveries also resulted in longer inpatient stays , outpatient visits , and more prescriptions filled . Most of the costs get covered by a health plan -- out-of-pocket expenses were similar for normal Caesarian deliveries , uncomplicated vaginal deliveries , and complicated births . Preventing premature births Prenatal care is essential in helping mothers carry their babies to term , experts say . The vitamin folate is especially important for mothers-to-be because it has been shown to prevent congenital abnormalities , said Janet Larson , chief of neonatology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Premature babies cost the United States at least $ 26 billion each year , according to the Institute of Medicine . Women who have a shortened cervix , or have certain infections , such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis , are at higher risk for having a premature baby , according to the NIH . A history of giving birth to premature babies is also a risk factor , said Dr. Charles Macri , obstetrician-gynecologist at the The George Washington University Hospital in Washington . A woman in this situation may take progesterone therapy between weeks 16 and 36 to decrease the likelihood of a premature delivery . A pregnant woman should always tell her doctor if she has had any kind of cervical surgery , which may also contribute to premature births , he said . Women who carry multiples babies at once , even twins , are also at higher risk of giving birth prematurely , he said . Not all premature births can be prevented , however . Some babies are `` destined to be born early , '' Macri said . About 50 percent of pregnancies that result in premature births are completely normal until labor , Sexson said . Costs for premature and low-birth-weight babies are also higher in terms of combined medical costs for the mother and child -- $ 64,713 , compared with $ 15,047 for uncomplicated births , the March of Dimes report said . Even in tough economic times , experts agree that pregnant women should not cut back on health care . `` Investing in health care costs -- that 's the best investment a family can make , '' Howse said .",What is the definition of a premature infant ?,a premature baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy
469,"LONDON , England -- Malaria is one of the world 's worst health problems and one of its biggest killers , with half a billion people affected every year , according to the Roll Back Malaria partnership . Around half a billion people are infected with malaria every year . Ninety percent of those cases are in Africa . Saturday marks World Malaria Day , when the world commemorates global efforts to eradicate the disease . Below CNN 's Vital Signs has produced a complete A - Z guide to how malaria spreads , the symptoms to look out for and how to protect yourself . A is for Anti-malarial drugs The history of anti-malarial medicine has been marked by a constant struggle between evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drugs . Currently , anti-malaria experts are focusing on therapies that combine several drugs for better effects . B is for Blood stream Once a mosquito has bitten and the malaria parasites reach the liver , the parasites divide and create thousands of mature parasites . These are released into the blood and infect red blood cells . At that point , typical malaria symptoms such as fever and anemia develop . C is for Chloroquine Until recently , Chloroquine , an anti-malarial drug , was the first option for many people because of its relatively low price and effectiveness . However , resistance to Chloroquine in many parts of the world has rendered the drug ineffective . D is for Diagnosis After noting your symptoms and travel history , your doctor will likely obtain a sample of your blood for observation . Two blood samples , taken at six - and 12-hour intervals , can usually confirm the presence of the malaria parasite and its type . It is possible to be infected by more than one parasite at the same time . E is for Epidemic According to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , large and devastating epidemics can occur when the mosquito-borne parasite is introduced into areas where people have had little prior contact with the infecting parasite . These epidemics can be triggered by wet weather conditions and further aggravated by floods or mass population movements driven by conflict . F is for Fever The most common symptom of all types of malarias is high fever , which is why doctors often misdiagnose malaria for flu . The fever is a reaction to toxins in the blood . It is therefore advised to tell your doctor you have been to a malaria affected zone , even if symptoms arise months after the trip . G is for Genome In 2002 , -- hundred years after it was discovered that mosquitoes transmit the malaria parasite -- the complete genetic codes of both the human malaria parasite and the mosquito that spreads it was cracked . This development brought scientists a step closer to developing drugs and vaccines to fight the disease , Nature magazine reported . H is for Hotspots Most cases and deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa , many of them occurring among children . However , Asia , Latin America , the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected . In 2006 , malaria was present in 109 countries and territories . I is for Immunity Travelers from malaria-free regions such as Europe and the United States , with little or no immunity , who go to areas with high disease rates , are particularly vulnerable . It is essential to take precautions by taking anti-malarial drugs prescribed by your doctor . J is for Julius Wagner-Jauregg Julius Wagner-Jauregg , a Viennese doctor , was the first to intentionally infect syphilis patients with malaria parasites . By controlling the subsequent malaria-related fever with an anti-malaria drug , the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized . Jauregg received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1927 . K is for Killer Malaria is a life-threatening disease but it is preventable and curable if the right steps are taken . Education in recognizing the symptoms has reduced the number of cases in some areas by 20 percent . Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming a killer . L is for Laser gun U.S. scientists say they are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes . The laser fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of wings , the lead scientist on the project told CNN . The project is being funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . M is for Mosquitoes Malaria is caused by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquitoes . The mosquitoes bite between sunset and sunrise and parasites from the mosquito are then injected into the person 's skin and transported to the liver . About 170 species of such parasites exist , but only four cause malaria in humans . N is for Nets The distribution of mosquito nets with insecticide is a very effective method of malaria prevention , and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods . These nets can often be obtained for around $ 3 . Earlier this month , actor Ashton Kutcher won a Twitter race against CNN to reach 1 million followers . Kutcher had pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to charity if he beat CNN , and 1,000 if he lost . CNN agreed to do the same . O is for Obstacles In many endemic areas , access to health facilities , as well as drug costs , still present major obstacles . Humanitarian agency Medecins Sans Frontieres estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between $ 0.25 and $ 2.40 per dose in 2002 . P is for Pandemic For malaria to become a pandemic -LRB- plague -RRB- in an area , several factors have to be present : high human population density ; high mosquito population density ; high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans . Q is for Quinine Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria in the 17th century . Since the 1940 's , many other anti-malarial drugs have appeared on the market and have taken precedent over quinine . But quinine is still being used to treat malaria in some cases . R is for Repellent The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says inspect repellents with DEET -LRB- most common active ingredient in strong insecticides -RRB- in them should be used on exposed skin and flying-insect spray can be used to kill mosquitoes in the sleeping area . DEET may be toxic , however and should be used with care . S is for Symptoms Fever is not the only symptom of malaria . Other symptoms can include shivers , headaches and nausea . Sweating and exhaustion is also common and in some cases , it can affect the brain or kidneys . T is for Tablets Malarone is a common anti-malaria drug among many travelers . It is said to have a 97 percent efficacy with relatively few side-effects . It can be given just one day before arrival in a malaria endemic country and only needs to be taken for another week after leaving . U is for Unborn child According to the WHO , pregnant women are at high risk of contracting malaria . The illness can result in high rates of miscarriages and cause more than 10 percent of maternal deaths annually . This figure can rise to 50 percent in cases of severe disease . V is for Vaccine Despite intensive research , no effective malaria vaccine has been developed to date . But according to a report in April 's New Scientist journal , a unique vaccine taken from the saliva of infected mosquitoes has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be tested in people . W is for World Malaria Day April 25 has become World Malaria Day to provide a global effort to control malaria around the world . The international malaria community only has two years left to meet the 2010 targets of delivering effective protection and treatment to all people at risk of malaria , as called for by the UN Secretary-General , Ban Ki-Moon . X is for X-ray X-ray microscopes are used to find the presence of malaria in red blood cells and see how they interact with healthy cells . One of the advantages of this type of microscope is that it produces very-high-resolution images of the cell structure . Y is for Yellow fever Yellow fever is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes . Some countries , such as Peru , require a certificate showing yellow-fever vaccination before you can travel there . Z is for Zanzibar Zanzibar , part of the African republic of Tanzania , has had relative successes in combating malaria ; Africa 's biggest killer according to the New Scientist journal .

470,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former President Bill Clinton left the hospital Friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries , longtime friend Terry McAuliffe told CNN . Clinton , 63 , was hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian Hospital 's Columbia campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days , according to Dr. Allan Schwartz , the hospital 's chief of cardiology . Two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery Thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that Clinton underwent in 2004 -- was blocked , Schwartz said . An electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack , Schwartz said . `` If I know Bill Clinton , he 's going to get right back on the phone , '' McAuliffe , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , told CNN on Friday . `` Yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room , they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery . `` He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti . And I guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he 'll be back on the phone . '' Schwartz said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with Clinton 's post-bypass diet or exercise , which Schwartz called excellent . Rather , Schwartz said , this is `` part of the natural history '' of the bypass treatment . `` He really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise . He really followed the program , '' Schwartz said , adding he told Clinton that he 'd be allowed to return to work Monday . The stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service , Schwartz said . Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient 's heart vessels where they are inflated , pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow . The graft 's blockage is n't unheard of , because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years , Schwartz said . However , a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of Clinton 's heart -- still looks `` pristine , '' Schwartz said . `` We know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open , '' he said . Stents and chest pain explained Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after Thursday 's procedure . In a written statement , Douglas Band , counselor to the former president , said : `` President Clinton is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and Haiti 's relief and long-term recovery efforts . '' Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea Clinton , and wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , were with him at the hospital Thursday night , Schwartz said . Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East , but her departure has been delayed until Saturday , a senior U.S. official said . Bill Clinton has n't left the public eye since he departed the White House in 2001 , maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches . Since the January 12 earthquake that hit Haiti , he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the U.N. special envoy . On February 3 , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon placed Clinton in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there . Clinton also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January . David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst , said Clinton was `` exhausted '' and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month . Clinton had busy schedule before heart procedure Clinton 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday . Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery . Dr. Spencer King , president of St. Joseph 's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , rejected as outdated suggestions that Clinton needs to slow down . `` This is kind of a '50s concept , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday . `` Now , we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done . The outlook for people is totally different . '' `` If he slows down , he slows down , '' said King , who who has not treated Clinton . But , he added , `` It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up . '' King said Thursday 's stenting procedure may not be the end of Clinton 's heart woes . `` The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more , '' he said . `` There 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again .

The Bibi Heybat Mosque , just outside the capital Baku . As a precaution , Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday `` following security concerns nearby , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said . The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group , two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan 's National Security Ministry told CNN . U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details `` are still unfolding , '' and the threat `` may or may not be '' linked to the Saturday raid . `` There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there , '' McCormack said , noting that no specific individuals were targeted . Several days ago , an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles , a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku , the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said . Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga , about 20 miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- northeast of Baku , the spokesman said . One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep , the spokesman said . Several others are still at large , he added . He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings . The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions . `` While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted , the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security , '' it said . Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea , and lies just north of Iran . McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume . He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday , as well .

489,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A group of native Hawaiians occupied the grounds of the old Hawaiian monarchy 's royal residence Wednesday , vowing to stay and do the business of the kingdom 's government . `` It is through a greater realm than ours '' that the group took this action , said Mahealani Kahau , elected leader of the group , called Hawaiian Kingdom Government . `` Today and every day , we will be here to assume our role . '' The group is one of several in Hawaii that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the U.S. minister to Hawaii -- overthrew the kingdom 's government . The monarchist groups say the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the United States illegally . Hawaii 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday 's action . The staff of Iolani Palace , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors . The 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action . The group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed . `` It saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , '' said palace staff member Cindy Ascencio , who added that although she is a native Hawaiian , she does not understand the actions of the group . Ascencio also said the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security . Jose Carrion , a visitor to Hawaii from Puerto Rico , told Honolulu 's KHON-TV that he was disappointed he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and `` learn about the culture of the Hawaiians . '' `` We wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of Hawaii and the last queen and the monarchy , '' said Carrion , who said he had reservations for the visit . `` But we 're leaving tomorrow , so we wo n't get to see the palace . '' Carrion also said he `` kind of understood '' the actions of the group . Puerto Rico and Hawaii , along with Guam and the Philippines , were annexed into the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War . Guam and Puerto Rico remain territories of the United States . The Philippines gained independence after World War II , and Hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 . Although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on King David Kalakaua , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms . The document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and Hawaiian landowners , barring 75 percent of the native Hawaiian population and all Asians . When Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document . With the help of John L. Stevens , the U.S. minister to Hawaii , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions . Two years later , under threat of U.S. troops , she yielded her authority , saying , `` Until such time as the government of the United States shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands . '' The queen was later imprisoned in Iolani Palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release . She died in 1917 at 79 . In 1993 , the U.S. Congress approved , and President Bill Clinton signed , an apology to the people of the Hawaiian islands . The document `` acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum . '' Although it was used as a seat of government for decades after Lili'uokalani 's reign , the palace fell into disrepair . When the last of the government offices moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began . It opened to the public in 1978 .

490,"LAS VEGAS , Nevada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former gridiron great O.J. Simpson will serve at least nine years in prison for his role in an armed confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel in 2007 . O.J. Simpson told the judge Friday that he was sorry for what he did but did n't think it was wrong . Simpson was sentenced to a maximum of 33 years with the possibility of parole after nine . Before the sentence , he offered a rambling , emotional apology in which he told District Judge Jackie Glass , his voice shaking , that he was sorry for his actions but believed he did nothing wrong . Glass , however , brushed his apology aside , saying his actions amounted to `` much more than stupidity , '' and calling him both arrogant and ignorant . `` Earlier in this case , at a bail hearing , I said to Mr. Simpson , I did n't know if he was arrogant , ignorant or both , '' Glass said . `` During the trial and through this proceeding , I got the answer , and it was both . '' She stressed that the sentence was not `` payback for anything else , '' apparently referring to Simpson 's acquittal 13 years ago in the slayings of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ron Goldman . Watch the judge say the sentence is n't about the past Â '' Grimacing , Simpson was escorted from the courtroom in shackles . Defense attorneys said Glass ' sentence was appropriate . `` It could have been a lot worse , '' Yale Galanter said , noting that Simpson and co-defendant Clarence `` C.J. '' Stewart both could have been sentenced to life in prison . A jury convicted Simpson , 61 , and Stewart , 54 , on 12 charges including conspiracy to commit a crime , robbery , assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon stemming from a September 13 , 2007 , incident at Las Vegas ' Palace Station hotel and casino . Prosecutors alleged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats , guns and force to take sports memorabilia from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley . Simpson claimed that he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him . All the men except Stewart made deals with prosecutors in exchange for their testimony . `` We 're happy that this case is coming to an end , '' Clark County district attorney David Roger said . `` We 're satisfied that we presented a good case to a jury , that the jury listened to all the evidence , particularly the audiotapes , and came to the resolution that we asked them to come to . '' He said he thought the sentence was fair . Simpson 's conviction came October 3 , the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman . Follow a timeline of Simpson 's legal woes Â '' Glass said , `` I 'm not here to sentence Mr. Simpson for what 's happened in his life previously in the criminal justice system . ... The jury decided . There are many people who disagree with that verdict , but that does n't matter to me . '' Goldman 's father and sister were in the courtroom for Friday 's sentencing . `` The back of his head looks the same as it did every day that we watched him in the criminal case , and we feel very proud of our efforts , '' Kim Goldman said . `` We feel very strongly that because of our pursuit of him for all these years , that it did drive him to the brink of this . '' Although Simpson was acquitted in the deaths , a civil jury later found him liable , slapping him with a $ 33 million judgment . Attorneys for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued Simpson 's financial assets to pay the judgment . In sentencing Simpson on Friday , Glass noted that he can be heard on tapes of the incident referring to the Goldmans as `` gold-diggers '' and saying he does n't want them to get his property . See how his sentence breaks down Â '' `` If that pushed him over the edge , great , '' Fred Goldman said afterward . `` Put him where he belongs . '' Watch Fred and Kim Goldman react Â '' Galanter said he thought the Goldmans ' presence was `` inappropriate . '' `` I do n't think they should have been here , '' he said . `` It reminded us all how the criminal justice system can run afoul , because the only thing Simpson should have been judged on is what happened here in Nevada . '' Denise Brown , the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson , issued a statement on the sentence saying , `` It is very sad to think that an individual who had it all , an amazing career , beautiful wife and two precious children , has ended up like this . `` Allowing wealth , power and control to consume himself , he made a horrific choice on June 12 , 1994 , which has spiraled into where he is today . '' Brown said she was saddened that the couple 's two children `` once again face the tragedy of yet another parent absent in their lives . '' In the statement , she asks for prayers for the children , Sydney and Justin , and the Brown family . Before being sentenced , Simpson told Glass he was `` sorry , somewhat confused , apologetic . '' He said the items he was trying to recover were his late ex-wife 's wedding ring for his daughter and family photos for his son . Watch Simpson 's apology Â '' `` I just wanted my personal things . I was stupid . I 'm sorry , '' Simpson said . `` I did n't know I was doing anything illegal . I thought I was confronting friends . I thought I was retrieving my things . I did n't mean to hurt anybody , and I did n't mean to steal anything . '' But Glass rejected those statements in imposing the sentence . `` When you take a gun with you and you take men with you ... in a show of force , that 's not just a ` Hey , give me my stuff back , ' '' Glass said . `` That 's something else . And that 's what went on here , and that 's why we 're all here . `` I have to tell you , it was much more than stupidity . ... You went to the room , you took guns -- meaning you and the group -- you used force , you took property , whether it was yours or somebody else 's , and in this state , that amounts to robbery with the use of a deadly weapon . '' The judge said Simpson 's contrite words in court were not as powerful as his angry words , as caught on tape , during the confrontation . `` Everything in this case was on tape , '' Glass said . `` The evidence in this case was overwhelming . '' Simpson 's attorneys asked that he be sentenced to no more than six years . A presentencing report recommended an 18-year term . Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson 's but will be eligible for parole in 7Â 1/2 years . `` I am as happy as someone could be when they know their client is going to reside for at least seven years in a cage , '' said Stewart 's attorney , Brent Bryson . Defense attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart have said they will appeal . On Friday , Glass denied motions asking that both defendants be allowed out on bail while the appeal is pending .

Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on `` The Sopranos '' and played alongside Robert De Niro in '' A Bronx Tale . '' Brancato , 32 , was also acquitted of two counts of burglary , but could face three to 15 years in prison on the attempted burglary charge . He has already served three years , according to his attorney , Joseph Tacopina . Police officer Daniel Enchautegui , 28 , was killed trying to break up a burglary attempt at his neighbor 's house in the Bronx in December 2005 . During the trial , Brancato said there was not a break-in . Brancato said he knew the owner of the home , and that he and friend Steven Armento , 51 , were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium . Brancato told the jury that the owner , a Vietnam veteran , gave him permission to come to his house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted . Brancato admitted to breaking a window at the home , but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and he said he was trying to wake up his friend to get the drugs . When Brancato and Armento entered the home , the next door neighbor -- Enchautegui -- came outside to investigate . That 's when prosecutors said Armento shot the officer through the heart with his .357 Magnum . Armento was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in November . The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento . Enchautegui was shot in the chest by Armento when he interrupted the alleged robbery , but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying . `` This jury spoke loud and clear , that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer , '' Tacopina said .

492,"JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pope Benedict XVI will not visit Israel 's Holocaust museum when he makes his first trip to the region as pope in May , though he will visit a memorial that is part of the site , his ambassador to Israel said Tuesday . Pope Benedict XVI , shown at the Vatican during a prayer Sunday , has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust . He will also become the first pontiff to visit the Dome of the Rock , one of the holiest sites in Islam , said the envoy , papal nuncio Antonio Franco . Foreign heads of state normally visit the Holocaust museum , which is part of the Yad Vashem complex in Jerusalem . But it includes controversial wording describing the role of Pope Pius XII during World War II , which is why Pope Benedict balked , an Israeli official said . Critics have accused Pope Pius of doing too little to prevent the mass murder of European Jews by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler . A caption in the museum says he maintained a neutral position during the years of mass extermination of Europe 's Jews . The Vatican defends him and is gradually opening its archives in an effort to show that he acted behind the scenes . Franco gave the news of Pope Benedict 's visit to Yad Vashem at a news conference in Jerusalem . Pope John Paul II also did not visit the museum section on his historic pilgrimage to Israel in 2000 , Father Federico Lombardi , a papal spokesman , said as he confirmed that Pope Benedict will not do so . An official with Israel 's Foreign Ministry said the decision was made jointly because of the sensitivity of the matter . Yigal Palmor conceded that there is an argument over the wartime pope 's actions during the Holocaust and noted that the museum has a sign stating that the facts are in dispute . He said that Pope Benedict may visit other parts of the Yad Vashem complex , which is divided into several compounds , and that the pontiff will lay a wreath at the site 's Hall of Remembrance , which is part of the protocol for visiting heads of state . The announcement that Pope Benedict will visit only part of Yad Vashem also follows international outrage over his rehabilitation of a rebel bishop who denied the Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust . The Vatican ordered the bishop , Richard Williamson , to recant , and said the pope was not aware of Williamson 's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication of the bishop . Pope Benedict , who was born in Germany and forced to join the Hitler Youth as a teenager , has spoken out forcefully against the Holocaust on a number of occasions , including on a visit to the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Pope Benedict will make his pilgrimage to the Holy Land May 8-15 with stops in Amman , Jerusalem , Bethlehem and Nazareth , according to the itinerary released by the Vatican . He will be celebrating Mass in Jerusalem , Bethlehem and Nazareth , the city where Christians believe Jesus preached and lived . Some 50,000 pilgrims are expected to attend that event , the bishop of Nazareth said . In Jerusalem , a city holy to all three of the major monotheistic faiths , Pope Benedict will visit the Western Wall , Judaism 's holiest prayer site , and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , which Catholics believe is the site of the crucifixion , burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ . The pope will also meet Israel 's chief rabbis and enter the Dome of the Rock with the chief Muslim cleric in the Holy Land , the grand mufti of Jerusalem . He will also meet Jordan 's King Abdullah and Israeli President Shimon Peres , as well as Mahmoud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority , Franco said .

Carlo Ancelotti will take over as manager of Chelsea from July 1 this year . Just 24 hours after resigning from his highly-successful eight-year stint at Italy 's AC Milan , he has been announced as the new manager of English Premier League club Chelsea -- replacing temporary manager Guus Hiddink . Chelsea , who won the FA Cup at the weekend , were looking for a permanent manager for the start of next season -- and Ancelotti has been signed on a three-year deal to the west-London club . A statement on Chelsea 's web site read : `` Carlo was the outstanding candidate for the job . He has proved over a long period his ability to build teams that challenged for , and have been successful in , major domestic and European competitions . '' Ancelotti , who turns 50 next week , has been in management since 1995 , when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana . Although he only spent one season at Reggiana , he managed to earn them promotion to the top-flight Serie A league . Since then he has managed Parma and Juventus , before taking on the San Siro-based giants AC Milan . Is Ancelotti 's appointment the right move for Chelsea ? Tell us in the Sound Off box below . As a manager he has enjoyed plenty of success , particularly in his time at the Rossoneri . He steered Milan to the Coppa Italia in 2003 , the Serie A title in 2003 -- 04 , the UEFA Champions League in both 2002 -- 03 and 2006 -- 07 , the UEFA Super Cup in 2003 and 2007 and the FIFA Club World Cup crown in 2007 .

The rebels -- former leaders in the Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement -- were known for hacking off civilians ' hands and feet during the war , which stood out for its viciousness even on a a continent that has suffered many horrific conflicts . Presiding Judge Pierre Boutet of Canada read the sentences . Former Revolutionary United Front `` interim leader '' Issa Hassan Sesay was sentenced to 52 years in prison , former commander Morris Kallon to 40 years , and former chief of security Augustine Gbao to 25 years . Sesay and Kallon had been found guilty on 16 counts , and Gbao was found guilty on 14 . The former rebels received credit for the six years each already has served in prison , Anderson told CNN . He said they will be imprisoned in another country , maybe Rwanda , because the prisons in Sierra Leone do not meet the standards of the U.N. court . Kallon was the only one of the three to express sorrow at his sentencing , Anderson said . `` He really had made a genuine expression of remorse , '' which is considered a stronger statement than regret , the court spokesman added . The court noted several mitigating factors at the sentencing , but `` in view of the gravity of the crimes , their impact was limited , '' a statement from the court said . The court noted that the crimes `` were committed upon a massive scale across several districts of Sierra Leone '' and that `` the impact of all these crimes upon the Sierra Leonean society has been enormous . '' `` The Chamber concluded that the inherent gravity of the criminal acts for which Sesay , Kallon and Gbao have been convicted is exceptionally high , '' the statement said . Corinne Dufka , a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch 's Africa division , had called the verdict `` very significant . '' `` The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days . Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation , but there was also horrific sexual violence , abductions , use of child soldiers and forced marriages , '' she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa . Eight people have been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebels ' side and some on the government 's . The U.N. Special Court 's mandate is to try only `` those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone . '' The trial of Sesay , Kallon and Gbao lasted nearly five years . The three had pleaded not guilty on all counts . The Special Court can not impose the death penalty . The Revolutionary United Front seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers . International forces retook the capital , Freetown , in 2000 . The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court . Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague , Netherlands , for his role in the conflict . The prosecution rested in the Taylor case in January after a year of presenting its arguments . Sierra Leone is known for its diamond wealth , but 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line . The Special Court is an independent tribunal established jointly by the United Nations and the Sierra Leone government . It is mandated to bring to justice those most responsible for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone after November 30 , 1996 .",what were the men convicted of ?,"crimes that included murder , rape , sexual slavery and forced marriages"
495,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The struggle for women 's rights against the backdrops of the Arab Spring and democratic progress in Africa will be recognized by this year 's Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday , at a ceremony unlikely to repeat controversy seen last year . Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , and Leymah Gbowee , a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country , will share the prize with Tawakkul Karman , an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in Yemen . The three , chosen `` for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights to full participation in peace-building work , '' will be honored in Oslo , Norway , during a program of events that culminates on Sunday in a star-studded concert . All three will be interviewed by CNN 's Jonathan Mann , a veteran of Nobel Peace Prize ceremonies , shortly after they receive their medals and $ 1.5 million in cash . The interviews and concert , hosted by actors Helen Mirren and Rosario Dawson , will be broadcast live online and mobile on CNN.com . Acts performing at the concert include David Gray , Jill Scott , rock band Evanescence and country duo Sugarland . Johnson Sirleaf , a 73-year-old Harvard graduate whose political resilience has earned her the nickname `` Iron Lady , '' became Africa 's first democratically-elected female president in 2006 , three years after decades of civil war ended . Crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former President Charles Taylor , she declared a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary-age children . Gbowee , 39 , led a women 's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in Liberia 's civil war . She mobilized hundreds of women to force delegates at 2003 peace talks to sign a treaty - at one point calling for a `` sex strike '' until demands were met .

Karman , the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize -- and one of its youngest recipients -- founded the rights group Women Journalists without Chains , and emerged as a key figure in protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's regime . While Johnson Sirleaf 's Nobel achievement has stirred anger among Liberian political opponents who claim recent elections were rigged in her favour , this year 's Nobel Peace Price is unlikely to attract the level of controversy seen in 2010 .

496,"DENVER , Colorado -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds , or even thousands , of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution , authorities say . A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients . Kristen Diane Parker , who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver , has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients , investigators said . She had hepatitis C , which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008 , authorities said . She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009 . Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker . According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration , Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C . She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients . Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be . She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl . Hospital officials then contacted the DEA . Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges . If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient , she could face up to 20 years in prison . If a patient dies because of her actions , she could face life in prison . In a statement to police , Parker said , `` I ca n't take back what I did , but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life , and so does everyone else . '' Her attorney could not be reached Friday . Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there . However , hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed . `` We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period , '' a statement on the hospital 's Web site said , adding , `` It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C. '' An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4 , 2009 , and July 1 , 2009 , when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs . Audubon is also contacting patients . According to the Centers for Disease Control , hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer .",What is hepatitis C ?,contagious liver disease
497,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes , whom officers shot dead in 2005 , mistaking him for a suicide bomber . The police offered `` a further unreserved apology '' for the death of de Menezes in 2005 , plus an undisclosed compensation package , the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement . `` All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved , '' the statement added . De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7 , 2005 . The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations , including one that found police acted illegally . A jury found in 2007 that London 's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting . It did not examine the cause of death . Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him . They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train , which would have given them a reason to shoot . But the coroner at the inquest , who acted as the judge , had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing . They returned an open verdict in the case , meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death . De Menezes ' family called the proceedings a `` whitewash '' because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing . De Menezes was killed July 22 , 2005 , a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system . Two weeks earlier , four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus , killing 52 people and wounding 977 . The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers . Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes , 27 , believing he was one of the suspects . They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station , where they chased him onto the platform and into a train , and shot him dead . The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action . `` We made a most terrible mistake , '' Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time , adding police needed to learn from the incident . `` I am sorry . '' The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair .

500,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former `` enemy combatant '' who was held in a South Carolina Naval brig for six years with no charges was sentenced Thursday to eight years and four months in prison , a Justice Department spokesman said . Ali al-Marri pleaded guilty in federal court in Illinois in May to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization . He could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison . `` This administration is committed to bringing terrorists to justice for their crimes , '' Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said . `` Al-Marri , who has been in U.S. custody since December 2001 , was dispatched by the highest levels of al Qaeda to carry out its terrorist objectives in America . '' A defense attorney for the Qatari citizen , who had been a student at Bradley University in Peoria , Illinois , when he was arrested , said the judge ruled on a lesser sentence to reflect the nearly six years al-Marri already spent at the Naval brig in Charleston , South Carolina . `` We 're pleased with the result , '' said the attorney , Larry Lustberg . `` Mr. al-Marri is also very pleased . '' Al-Marri was transferred to a federal prison in Illinois in March after President Obama ordered a review of his case . The case was ultimately referred to the Justice Department , which filed charges . The Pentagon said he trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to court documents filed earlier in the case . According to a copy of his plea agreement , al-Marri admitted that he `` knowingly conspired and agreed with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed '' to provide support to al Qaeda and to work under the organization 's direction and control . `` Between 1998 and 2001 , the defendant attended various training camps because he wished to engage in jihad , '' the document said . While in the training camps and in al Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan , he was known by the name Abdul-Rahman al-Qatari , according to the plea agreement . Mohammed approached al-Marri in 2001 about his offer to assist al Qaeda , the plea agreement said . `` The defendant was instructed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to enter the United States no later than September 10 , 2001 , with an understanding that he was to remain in the United States for an undetermined length of time , '' the documents said . Al-Marri applied to Bradley using the same e-mail address he used to communicate with Mohammed , the plea agreement said . At Bradley , he `` rarely attended classes and was in a failing status by the end of his first semester . '' On September 21 , 2001 , al-Marri traveled to another central Illinois university and created five e-mail accounts under different aliases , the documents said . `` By this time , the defendant knew that al Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States and fully understood why Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had directed him to be in the United States before that date . '' He used the new e-mail accounts to inform Mohammed of his whereabouts and activities , and also gave him his cell phone number in encoded format , according to the plea agreement . In addition , he conducted online research `` related to various cyanide compounds . The defendant 's focus was on various cyanide substances ... the defendant reviewed toxicity levels , the locations where these items could be purchased , and specific pricing of the compounds , '' the documents said . He also explored obtaining sulfuric acid . An almanac found at al-Marri 's residence was bookmarked `` at pages showing dams , waterways and tunnels in the United States , '' the plea agreement said . Al-Marri initially was arrested on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 . But his continued confinement without charges mushroomed into a major legal case before federal prosecutors filed charges in February . The Supreme Court ruled on March 6 that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges , and granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss his challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely without charges . He was transferred to civilian custody and taken to Illinois in March . The court 's ruling , however , meant that the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain accused terrorists and other criminals in the United States remains unresolved .

501,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's difficult to overestimate Quincy Jones 's contribution to American music . Over the last 60 years he has excelled as a musician , composer , record producer , arranger , conductor and media company executive . Quincy Jones has won 27 Grammy awards during his extraordinary career . In a career studded with landmarks , Jones produced Michael Jackson 's multi-platinum albums '' Off The Wall , '' `` Bad '' and `` Thriller '' -- the best selling album of all time -- and produced and conducted `` We Are The World , '' one of the biggest-selling singles in history . Quincy Delight Jones Jr. , known to his friends as `` Q , '' was born on March 14 , 1933 , in Chicago . He moved to Seattle as a child and began playing trumpet aged 12 . When he was 14 he befriended a young Ray Charles , who taught him how to arrange music , and Jones was soon playing bebop in nightclubs , backing up the likes of Billie Holiday . In 1951 , Jones won a music scholarship at prestigious Schillinger House , in Boston , but he abandoned his studies to tour with bandleader Lionel Hampton . By the mid-50s , he was arranging and recording for the likes of Sarah Vaughan , Duke Ellington and his old friend Ray Charles . In 1956 he toured with Dizzy Gillespie 's Big Band , recording his first album as a leader in the same year . In 1957 , Jones moved to Paris to study music composition and theory , taking a job with Mercury Records ' French distributor to pay for his studies . After a European tour proved a financial disaster , the president of Mercury offered him a position at the record label and Jones soon became vice-president at the company . In the 60s , Jones worked as a conductor and arranger for Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald . He also began scoring music for films , including `` In the Heat of the Night , '' `` In Cold Blood '' and `` The Pawnbroker , '' which featured his hit `` Soul Bossa Nova , '' later re-used as the theme to the `` Austin Powers '' movies . Jones would go on to score 33 movies during his career and he also composed the themes for TV shows such as `` Ironside , '' `` The Bill Cosby Show '' and `` Roots , '' which earned him an Emmy award . Having made his name as a composer and arranger in the 70s , he moved away from jazz to record a series of hit albums of his own soulful music . See photos of Quincy in Seattle '' Jones 's career was dramatically put on hold in 1974 , when he suffered a severe aneurysm , but it did little to stall his incredible drive . In the 80s , as well as producing three Michael Jackson albums and `` We are the World , '' he co-produced and scored the Steven Spielberg movie `` The Color Purple , '' and formed multi-media company Quincy Jones Entertainment . In his role as CEO he was executive producer of TV series `` The Fresh Prince of Bel Air '' and published `` Vibe '' and `` SPIN '' magazines . His 1989 album `` Back On The Block '' won Album Of The Year at the Grammys and 1993 's `` Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux '' , featuring Jones conducting Miles Davis , earned another Grammy . All in all , Jones has won 27 Grammys , been nominated for seven Academy Awards , and has added to his business interests with Quincy Jones Media Group and Qwest Broadcasting . Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle , Jones has long been involved in social activism . He supported Martin Luther King 's Operation Breadbasket , which promoted economic development in the inner cities , and worked on Reverend Jesse Jackson 's People United to Save Humanity project . Jones founded the Listen Up ! Foundation , which has worked on youth projects in Los Angeles and South Africa , and he helped launch the We Are the Future project , which helps children in poor and conflict-ridden areas . He is also one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music -LRB- IBAM -RRB- , which raises money to establish a national library of African-American art and music . Over the course of his incredible career , Jones somehow found the time to marry three times and father seven children . In 1990 , his life was chronicled in the movie `` Listen Up : The Lives of Quincy Jones '' and in 2001 , Jones published `` Q : The Autobiography of Quincy Jones . '' Watch Quincy Jones on My City_My Life '' Of his own career , which has taken him from being a teenage musician in the clubs of Seattle to a world-famous music mogul , Jones says , `` You have to turn all of your drunken dreams into sober realizations .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , left , greets Iraq 's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday . `` Iraq today does n't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime , '' al-Maliki told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a Sunday meeting between two leaders , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office . `` Today 's Iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law , and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect , '' al-Maliki said . Earlier , Iran 's state-run news agency IRNA quoted the Iraqi leader as saying that `` Baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries , including Iran . '' His remarks come as the United States and Iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the U.S. military will remain in Iraq and what role it will play in Iraq 's security . But al-Maliki media adviser Ali Hadi said negotiations between Iraq and the United States are in their `` very early stages '' and were not part of Sunday 's talks . Watch Ahmadinejad and al-Maliki sit down for talks '' `` The treaty is purely an Iraqi-American treaty . The Iranians have nothing to do with it , '' Hadi said . `` We will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an Iraqi issue . '' The proposed U.S.-Iraqi pact has triggered street protests in Iraq , where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent American bases , a long-term presence of U.S. troops and a weakening of Iraqi government control over those troops . Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , whose militia was the target of a U.S.-backed Iraqi clampdown in Basra and Baghdad recently , has called for weekly protests against the agreement . Al-Maliki and Ahmadinejad met Sunday afternoon , with Ahmadinejad calling on Iraq 's neighbors and the United Nations to help restore security and stability to Iraq , IRNA reported . And al-Maliki thanked Ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding U.N. sanctions against Iraq that date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf war . Iran has long called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , which the United States invaded in 2003 . Meanwhile , the United States has accused Iran of arming and training `` criminal '' Shiite militias in Iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , allegations the Iranians deny . It is al-Maliki 's third visit to Iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago . The two countries , which are neighbors , both have Shiite Muslim majorities , and al-Maliki 's ruling coalition is dominated by Shiite religious parties long backed by Iran . Adnan Pachachi , a leading Sunni Arab member of Iraq 's parliament , told CNN he wanted al-Maliki to call on Iran to stop supporting armed factions in Iraq . `` I think this has to stop , '' Pachachi told CNN . `` I hope that Mr. Maliki will make it absolutely clear that Iraqis of all parties , of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins , are strongly opposed to Iran 's attempt to interfere in Iraq 's affairs . '' Pachachi , a former foreign minister , said al-Maliki 's predecessor , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , allowed Iraq 's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias , and that U.S. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out . `` In the long run , it is in the interest of the United States to have a secure Iraq and armed forces and security forces of Iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties , '' he said .",Iraq 's prime minister in Iran trying to calm fears over any U.S.-Iraq security pact,Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday tried to allay Iranian
504,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mumia Abu-Jamal sits on Pennsylvania 's death row , perhaps the most recognized of the 228 condemned inmates at the Greene Correctional Facility , an hour south of Pittsburgh . Former radio host and convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal during a 1994 interview Abu-Jamal , inmate AM8335 , awaits three milestones . His new book , `` Jailhouse Lawyers , '' will be released next month . He 's also awaiting a pair of Supreme Court decisions , which could come in the next two weeks . The former Black Panther was sentenced to die for gunning down a Philadelphia police officer 28 years ago . The high court will decide whether he deserves a new hearing to determine whether his execution should go forward . The state is appealing a federal appeals court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu-Jamal 's favor last year . The case has attracted international attention . Abu-Jamal 's lawyers filed a separate appeal claiming that racism led to his 1982 conviction . That petition is scheduled for consideration by the Supreme Court on April 3 . If either case is accepted by the justices for review , oral arguments would be held in the fall . The former radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial . Others counter that Abu-Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions . They say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism . He was convicted for the December 9 , 1981 , murder of officer Daniel Faulkner , 25 , in Philadelphia . Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal 's brother in a late-night traffic stop . Witnesses said Abu-Jamal , who was nearby , ran over and shot the police officer in the back and in the head . Abu-Jamal , once known as Wesley Cook , was also wounded in the confrontation and later admitted to the killing , according to other witnesses ' testimony . Abu-Jamal is black , and the police officer was white . Incarcerated for nearly three decades , Abu-Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system . On a Web site created by friends to promote his release , the prisoner-turned-author writes about his fight . `` This is the story of law learned , not in the ivory towers of multi-billion dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave-ship , in the hidden , dank dungeons of America . '' His chief defense attorney , Robert Bryan , has filed appeals asking for a new criminal trial . `` The central issue in this case is racism in jury selection , '' he wrote to supporters last month . `` We are in an epic struggle in which his life hangs in the balance . What occurs now in the Supreme Court will determine whether Mumia will have a new jury trial or die at the hands of the executioner , '' Bryan said . Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced him to death . A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals kept the murder conviction in place a year ago but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing . `` The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , '' Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica wrote in the 77-page opinion . The federal appeals court ultimately concluded that the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh `` mitigating factors '' offered by the defense that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row . Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance , such as the fact that Abu-Jamal had no prior criminal record . Months before that ruling , oral arguments on the issue were contentious . Faulkner 's widow and Abu-Jamal 's brother attended , and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia . If the Supreme Court refuses now to intervene on the sentencing issue , the city 's prosecutor would have to decide within six months whether to conduct a new death penalty sentencing hearing or allow Abu-Jamal to spend the rest of his life in state prison . Many prominent groups and individuals , including singer Harry Belafonte , the NAACP and the European Parliament , are cited on his Web site as supporters . Prosecutors have insisted that Abu-Jamal pay the price for his crimes and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row for Faulkner 's murder . `` This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu-Jamal is some kind of a folk hero , '' Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said last year , when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction . `` He is nothing short of an assassin . '' The city has honored the fallen police officer with a street designation and a commemorative plaque placed at the spot where he was shot and killed . The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , wrote a book two years ago about her husband and the case : `` Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Loss , Pain and Injustice . '' She writes that she was trying to `` definitively lay out the case against Mumia Abu-Jamal and those who 've elevated him to the status of political prisoner .

505,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Senate Wednesday approved a bill to put new rules in place for intelligence agency eavesdropping on suspected terrorists . Communication technologies like mobile phones have made the 1978 FISA bill out of date , supporters say . The bill also effectively protects telephone companies from being sued for cooperating with a government surveillance program launched in the wake of the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . The White House pushed hard for the provision , with a threat to veto the bill if it did not contain protection for phone companies . The vote was 69-28 , with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois voting in favor . Republican candidate Sen. John McCain of Arizona was not present for the vote . President Bush said Wednesday afternoon he will sign the bill , calling it `` vital '' and `` long overdue . '' Watch Bush praise the new FISA bill '' The bill , formally known as the FISA Amendments Act , updates the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . It will : Opponents argued that the provision creating a judicial review of cases against the telecommunication companies is a sham . The bill essentially grants immunity to the telecommunication companies , the opponents said , because all of the telephone carriers received government certifications saying their participation in the program was legal . Obama was criticized for backing away from his early opposition to the bill by liberal bloggers and individuals commenting on his campaign Web site . Before voting for the bill , Obama voted for an amendment offered by Sen. Christopher Dodd , D-Connecticut , that would have stripped the language granting immunity to telecommunications companies . Civil liberties groups have vowed to fight the legislation in court . `` This fight is not over . We intend to challenge this bill as soon as President Bush signs it into law , '' Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU National Security Project , said in a statement issued minutes after the Senate approved the bill . `` The bill allows the warrantless and dragnet surveillance of Americans ' international telephone and e-mail communications . It plainly violates the Fourth Amendment . '' President Bush acknowledged in 2005 that he ordered the secretive National Security Agency to intercept communications between U.S. residents and people overseas suspected of having ties to terrorism . The administration says the program was authorized when Congress approved military action against al Qaeda after the 2001 attacks .

Pakistani soldiers on patrol in the Swat Valley , which is home to the country 's only ski resort . Militants forced their way into the state-run hotel in the northwestern tourist valley early Thursday morning , ransacked it and set it on fire , said Sardar Rehim Shahzad , district coordinator for Swat police . The hotel , the only one at the Malam Jabba ski resort , sustained significant damage , he told CNN . The resort is located near the Afghanistan border and about 300km -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- from the capital city of Islamabad . It was shut down last summer after militants overran the area , keeping tourists away , Shahzad said . Swat Valley , located in North West Frontier Province -LRB- NWFP -RRB- , was once Pakistan 's biggest tourist destination . Aside from the ski resort , it was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area . In recent months , however , militants bent on imposing fundamentalist Islamic law , or Sharia , have unleashed a wave of violence across the NWFP which has claimed hundreds of lives , many of them security personnel . The militants want women to wear veils , beards for men and to ban music and television . After months of bloody battles , the government in May reached a peace deal with fighters loyal to the banned hardline Islamic group , Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi -LRB- TNSM -RRB- . It is the latest attempt by Pakistan 's new government -- headed by the party of the assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto -- to achieve peace through negotiations in the lawless tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein . Ahead of the peace pact , Pakistan 's government released TNSM 's former leader Sufi Mohammed , who had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan . He was freed after agreeing to cooperate with the government . Under the terms of his release , TNSM was also expected to lay down its arms and forgo violence . But his son-in-law Fazlullah , who took over TNSM during his jail stint , vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region .",What is the name of the Pakistan ski resort ?,Malam Jabba
508,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the U.N. Children 's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge 's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man . UNICEF 's Ann Veneman said consent can not be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision . `` Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework , the marriage of a child is a violation of that child 's rights , '' said Ann Veneman , executive director of UNICEF . `` The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Consent can not be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision . '' The most recent ruling , in which the judge upheld his original verdict , was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza , where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl 's mother , seeking a divorce for her daughter . Have your say by clicking here A relative said the judge , Sheikh Habib al-Habib , `` stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty . '' The family member , who requested anonymity , added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter . The case , which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups , came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality . The judge ruled that the girl 's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , Abdullah al-Jutaili , the mother 's attorney , told CNN at the time . The girl 's father , according to the lawyer , arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man , who is a close friend of his . At the time of the initial verdict , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , al-Jutaili told CNN . The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty , she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court , the lawyer said . Last month , an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting al-Habib 's verdict , and sent the case back to him for reconsideration . Under the complicated Saudi legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect , but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing . The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month , according to the relative . The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently . While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. . `` It is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , '' Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in remarks last January , according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper . `` A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married . Those who think she 's too young are wrong , and they are being unfair to her . '' Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry . `` We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , '' he said , according to the newspaper . `` We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women . '' Sharia law is Islamic law . Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism . CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment . Christoph Wilcke , a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch , told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages . `` We 've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men , '' Wilcke said . Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children , `` It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts , and in many realms beyond the court . '' In December , Zuhair al-Harithi , a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission , said his organization is fighting against child marriages . `` The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia , '' al-Harithi said . `` Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed . '' He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place . Wajeha al-Huwaider , co-founder of the Society of Defending Women 's Rights in Saudi Arabia , told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to `` keep us backward and in the dark ages . '' She said the marriages cause girls to `` lose their sense of security and safety . Also , it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured . It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression . ''",What violates the child 's rights ?,marriage of a

The Shen Neng 1 veered more than 27 kilometers -LRB- 17 miles -RRB- off course and ended up on a shoal in the Reef on April 3 , prompting concerns of an oil spill near the world 's largest coral reef system . On Wednesday , the Australian Federal Police announced that they have arrested the 47-year-old Chinese master of the vessel and the 44-year-old chief officer . The captain was charged with liability for the vessel . He faces a maximum fine of A$ 55,000 -LRB- U.S. $ 50,852 -RRB- . The chief officer is accused of being on watch when the ship caused the damage . He faces up to three years in prison and a fine of A$ 220,000 -LRB- U.S. $ 203,411 -RRB- . Authorities did not disclose the name of either man . The ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to China from the Australian port of Gladstone when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef , just north of Great Keppel Island . About 950 tons of oil were on board . A small oil slick caused by the ship 's grounding did not threaten the Great Barrier Reef after crews sprayed dispersants on it and surface netting helped to contain it .

Chad President Idriss Deby , right , and Sudan 's President Omar al-Beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar , Senegal , between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby , the president of Chad . Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq . Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . The rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad . They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena , the capital of Chad , in early February . As recently as Thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border .

Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill commemorating Harvey Milk , the first openly gay politician elected to public office in the state , a spokesman for the governor said Monday . Stuart Milk , nephew of Harvey Milk , sits next to a photo of the gay rights activist in March . `` He really saw this signing as a way to honor the gay community in California , '' spokesman Aaron McLear told CNN in a telephone interview . Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level . But since then , `` Milk has become much more of a symbol of the gay community , '' McLear said , citing the eponymous movie starring Sean Penn , Milk 's posthumous receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and his induction into the California Hall of Fame . Milk served briefly as San Francisco 's supervisor before he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in 1978 by Dan White , a city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back . Under the measure , the governor each year would proclaim May 22 -- Milk 's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state . The bill was one of 704 signed Sunday -- most of them near the midnight deadline -- by Schwarzenegger , said spokesman Aaron McLear . The legislation passed the state Senate in May and the state Assembly last month . The legislation has been divisive , with the governor 's office receiving more than 100,000 phone calls and e-mails , most of them in opposition , spokeswoman Andrea McCarthy said last month . But she added that most of the Twitter posts the governor received were in favor of the bill . Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year , saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level . Milk was a `` unique '' historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was `` assassinated in his public office for being who he was , '' State Sen. Mark Leno , a Democrat , told CNN last month . The day of significance would not close schools or state offices , according to its text . However , Randy Thomasson , the president of SaveCalifornia.com , said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools , including gay pride parades or `` mock gay weddings . '' `` Harvey Milk was a terrible role model for children , '' said Thomasson , whose organization opposed the bill . `` The reality is Harvey Milk is a hero to so many people and a great role model , '' said Geoff Kors , executive director of Equality California , the group that backed the bill introduced by Leno . `` It 's very appropriate that the state he worked in and passed the first gay rights bill in the country should honor him . '' He said the bill marks the first time any state has officially honored an openly gay person . Leno said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay-pride parades and similar activities were `` hyperbole . '' The bill `` mandates nothing , '' he said , although it `` affords an educational opportunity .

NATO later called the subsequent mass casualties caused by the strike `` tragic -LRB- and -RRB- unintended . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have called the incident a `` tragedy '' and offered condolences , though Washington has not issued a formal apology . The issue of U.S. and fellow NATO forces coming into Pakistan has been an especially sensitive topic in that country since May , when U.S. commandos killed then al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders ' consent During an exclusive interview last week with CNN , Gilani said the country wants to maintain its relationship with the United States as long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty . Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect , the prime minister said : `` At the moment -LRB- it is -RRB- not . '' `` If I ca n't protect the sovereignty of my country , how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest ? '' he asked rhetorically . Pakistan has taken several steps aimed at NATO since the attack .

518,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver , the sister of President John F . Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics , died Tuesday , the Special Olympics said . She was 88 . Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006 . Born on July 10 , 1921 , in Brookline , Massachusetts , Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy . She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics , which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962 . Today , 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations , according to the Special Olympics . `` She was the light of our lives , a mother , wife , grandmother , sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others , '' the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement . `` For each of us , she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games , to visit us in our homes , to attend to her own mother , her sisters and brothers , and to sail , tell stories , and laugh and serve her friends . '' No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements , a source close to the family said . Shriver 's husband , R. Sargent Shriver , and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died , the Special Olympics said in a statement . Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver 's life '' `` We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder , '' Brady Lum , Special Olympics president and chief operating officer , said in a statement Tuesday . `` Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement . It is an enormous loss , but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family , friends , and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed . '' Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968 , Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector . She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets . In September 1962 , Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister , Rosemary , which was published in The Saturday Evening Post . At an event honoring her in 2007 , Shriver spoke of her life : `` Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities . `` As important as it has been , it is not the whole story of my life . My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities . It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children . ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband . '' Watch Shriver reflect on her life '' At the same event , Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister , saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents , including compassion . `` She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind . She picked this up , obviously , at a very early age . All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary . '' After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945 , helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life . From 1947 to 1948 , she worked for $ 1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency . See highlights of Shriver 's public and private life '' In the early 1950s , she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago , Illinois . She married Sargent Shriver Jr. , a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant , in 1953 . The couple 's five children include California 's first lady , Maria Shriver . Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s , including Head Start and the Peace Corps . He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics . He ran President Johnson 's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 . He was Democrat George McGovern 's running mate in the 1972 presidential election . In 1957 , Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. . Foundation , which was established in 1946 to honor the family 's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people . Watch Shriver receive a special honor '' Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy . In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children , adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008 . Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s , Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp , called Camp Shriver , on her farm in Maryland . Her vision expanded over the years , and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago . She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States , including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971 .

She was 76 . Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg . Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s . Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma . He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal . He was acquitted in a second trial . His retrial in 1985 received national attention . `` We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , '' said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie `` Ala '' Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman . `` She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members . '' Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family . She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $ 75 million , according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com 's Crime Library Web site . In her early years , she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly . She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage , to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria . That marriage produced two children : Alexander and Annie Laurie . The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter , Cosima . On the morning of December 22 , 1980 , family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family 's posh Newport , Rhode Island , home . She never regained consciousness . She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered , according to the Crime Library site . Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar . Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin . The case also led to a major motion picture , `` Reversal of Fortune . '' Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow . Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz , who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction , said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow 's death is `` a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime . We proved overwhelming -LSB- ly -RSB- that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced . We saved his life , but could not save hers . '' Claus von Bulow 's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow 's alcohol use , among other factors , caused her coma . Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England . Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said . The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren . Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham , who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow , filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal . The case was settled out of court in 1987 , according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island . Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife 's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped . The von Bulows ' daughter , Cosima , sided with her father . Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne , who covered the von Bulow case , told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998 .

523,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A national campaign to inoculate tens of millions of Americans against H1N1 influenza began Monday , with health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee targeted as the first recipients , federal health authorities said . Health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee are among the first to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday . `` I think the world has watched history unfold , '' Dr. Judy Monroe , Indiana 's state health commissioner , told reporters at Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis . Earlier Monday , the hospital received a shipment of 52 boxes -- each containing 100 pre-filled sprayers . `` This first 5,200 doses that came to Marion County is really just the tip of the iceberg , '' Monroe said . Health Director Virginia Caine said the shipment will be split among the county 's hospitals . A similar scene unfolded at LeBonheur Children 's Medical Center in Memphis , Tennessee , where three children have died from H1N1 , sometimes referred to as swine flu . Jennilyn Utkov , a spokeswoman for LeBonheur , said the hospital received about 100 doses . By noon , the supply had been depleted . The vaccines shipped to both sites and to a few other places around the nation are the first of some 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Dr. Jay Butler told reporters at the Indianapolis event . That number includes both spray and injectable forms . Butler , who heads the agency 's 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force , has promised there will be enough for anyone who wants it . Butler said vaccine makers will ship 10 million to 20 million doses per week over the next couple of months . `` Is that fast enough ? '' he asked . `` No , but it 's what 's feasible . It 's what can be done . '' Monroe predicted that an ample supply of the injectable form will be available by mid-October . Last week , the CDC said it had received reports of 60 deaths of children related to H1N1 flu since April ; 11 of those deaths were reported last week alone . From August 30 until September 26 , the agency tallied 16,174 hospitalizations nationwide and 1,379 deaths associated with influenza virus infection . iReport.com : How should H1N1 be handled ? The 27 states reporting widespread flu activity are Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Mexico , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Texas , Tennessee , Virginia , Washington and Wyoming . Track the H1N1 virus '' Nearly all of the viruses identified so far are H1N1 , the agency said in a posting on its Web site . `` These viruses remain similar to the virus chosen for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine '' and remain susceptible to antiviral drugs `` with rare exception , '' it added . Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women , children , young adults and people with chronic lung disease , heart disease or diabetes -- should be among the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus , health officials have said . Understanding the H1N1 virus '' According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in late August , two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu . Health care workers may not necessarily be foremost among them . In the past , about 40 percent of health care workers have opted to be vaccinated against the flu , according to the CDC . Health officials also have recommended people reduce their chances of getting sick by washing their hands frequently , sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one 's hand and staying home when sick . More than 340,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and more than 4,100 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization . Many countries -- including the United States -- have stopped counting cases , particularly of milder illness , meaning that the true number is likely much higher .",Who are going to be the first recipients of the H1N1 vaccine ?,health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee
524,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fighting has prompted thousands of people in the southern part of Sudan 's Darfur region to seek security and shelter at a refugee camp in the northern part of the war-torn area , according to the United Nations . A member of the Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- stands guard near the Sudan-Chad border in 2007 . The U.N. 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- OCHA -RRB- reported that fighting in Muhajeria and Shearia between Sudanese government forces , and the rebel Justice and Equality Movement -LRB- JEM -RRB- , drove over 15,000 people north to the Zam Zam camp . The water supply to the camp is becoming strained with displaced people arriving there every day , OCHA said Wednesday . The government of Sudan has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years , a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide . An estimated 300,000 people in the western Sudanese region have been killed through combat , disease or malnutrition , according to the United Nations . An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels , government forces and the violent Janjaweed militias . Fighting continues in the region despite the JEM and local government signing a `` goodwill and confidence-building '' agreement earlier in February , according to the U.N. . The U.N.-African Union allied peacekeeping mission -LRB- UNAMID -RRB- will begin building a new community police center near Zam Zam in the next two weeks , the U.N. announced Saturday . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government . To counter the rebels , Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the United Nations , Western governments and human rights organizations . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength . Last year , Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government 's campaign of violence in Darfur . Under pressure to end the fighting , Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur . But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement was not included in the case-fire talks .

525,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three former guerrilla leaders -- who helped command what one activist called `` one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days '' -- were sentenced Wednesday in Freetown , Sierra Leone , for crimes against humanity . Amputee victims of Sierra Leone 's civil war take part in football training at a beach in Freetown . The U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone found the men guilty in February of crimes that included murder , rape , sexual slavery and forced marriages stemming from a civil war that lasted from March 1991 to January 2002 . They were arrested in March 2003 , said Peter Anderson , spokesman for the U.N. court . The rebels -- former leaders in the Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement -- were known for hacking off civilians ' hands and feet during the war , which stood out for its viciousness even on a a continent that has suffered many horrific conflicts . Presiding Judge Pierre Boutet of Canada read the sentences . Former Revolutionary United Front `` interim leader '' Issa Hassan Sesay was sentenced to 52 years in prison , former commander Morris Kallon to 40 years , and former chief of security Augustine Gbao to 25 years . Sesay and Kallon had been found guilty on 16 counts , and Gbao was found guilty on 14 . The former rebels received credit for the six years each already has served in prison , Anderson told CNN . He said they will be imprisoned in another country , maybe Rwanda , because the prisons in Sierra Leone do not meet the standards of the U.N. court . Kallon was the only one of the three to express sorrow at his sentencing , Anderson said . `` He really had made a genuine expression of remorse , '' which is considered a stronger statement than regret , the court spokesman added . The court noted several mitigating factors at the sentencing , but `` in view of the gravity of the crimes , their impact was limited , '' a statement from the court said . The court noted that the crimes `` were committed upon a massive scale across several districts of Sierra Leone '' and that `` the impact of all these crimes upon the Sierra Leonean society has been enormous . '' `` The Chamber concluded that the inherent gravity of the criminal acts for which Sesay , Kallon and Gbao have been convicted is exceptionally high , '' the statement said . Corinne Dufka , a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch 's Africa division , had called the verdict `` very significant . '' `` The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days . Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation , but there was also horrific sexual violence , abductions , use of child soldiers and forced marriages , '' she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa . Eight people have been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebels ' side and some on the government 's . The U.N. Special Court 's mandate is to try only `` those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone . '' The trial of Sesay , Kallon and Gbao lasted nearly five years . The three had pleaded not guilty on all counts . The Special Court can not impose the death penalty . The Revolutionary United Front seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers . International forces retook the capital , Freetown , in 2000 . The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court . Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague , Netherlands , for his role in the conflict . The prosecution rested in the Taylor case in January after a year of presenting its arguments . Sierra Leone is known for its diamond wealth , but 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line . The Special Court is an independent tribunal established jointly by the United Nations and the Sierra Leone government . It is mandated to bring to justice those most responsible for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone after November 30 , 1996 .",what was the convictions,"of crimes that included murder , rape , sexual slavery and forced marriages"
526,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present . Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing . Blagojevich said he expects lawmakers to vote to convict him . He is facing federal corruption allegations , including trying to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president . The second-term Democratic governor has denied wrongdoing . Instead of attending the trial , Blagojevich hit the media circuit Monday . He appeared on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' and `` The View , '' and was scheduled to give his first live prime-time interview Monday night on CNN 's `` Larry King Live . '' Speaking on `` Good Morning America , '' Blagojevich restated his complaints about what he called the `` unconstitutional '' impeachment trial , which he said `` denies me the right to call witnesses to defend myself and prove my innocence . '' Watch Blagojevich say he 's done `` nothing wrong '' '' He said he is certain the Illinois Senate will vote to remove him from office and said he expects they will demand he step down `` relatively soon . '' Earlier this month , the Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach him . Blagojevich has said the vote was politically motivated . Under the Illinois Constitution , the House can vote to impeach an executive or judicial officer , but it is the Senate that conducts the trial . A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict an officer of an impeachable offense . According to a federal complaint issued in December , Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris -- who also was arrested on federal corruption charges -- were `` conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits '' for the governor by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama . `` I 've got this thing and it 's -LSB- expletive -RSB- golden , '' Blagojevich allegedly said in one recorded phone conversation , referring to his authority to appoint , according to the complaint . `` I 'm just not giving it up for -LSB- expletive -RSB- nothing . '' When asked about those alleged quotes , Blagojevich told ABC that federal prosecutors `` took snippets of conversations completely out of context . '' `` When the whole story comes out , you 'll see that the effort was to work to have a senator who can best represent Illinois , '' he said . Blagojevich has said his rights are being violated because he can not challenge assertions in the House impeachment report . Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial '' Blagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett , a confidant of Obama 's ; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel . Emanuel , claimed Blagojevich , agrees that he did not break any laws . State Sen. Matt Murphy , part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together , called Blagojevich 's complaints `` the theater of the absurd . '' iReport.com : Do you trust your political leaders ? `` What you 've seen here ... is a cynical effort on the part of this governor that 's perfectly consistent with his actions over the last six years , to try and further undermine the faith in this process that the people already have , '' Murphy said . He said the House prosecution team responsible for presenting the impeachment case to the Senate is operating under the same restrictions as Blagojevich with regard to calling witnesses . Murphy said on `` Good Morning America '' that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has asked both sides to `` defer to the criminal prosecution '' of Blagojevich and `` limit witnesses . '' He noted that the governor has every right to submit `` positive statements that the governor says exonerate him '' -- such as those from Jarrett , Jackson and Emanuel -- as evidence in the Senate trial . `` We have lowered the standard for the admission of evidence for the governor to bend over backward to make this fair , '' Murphy said . `` The suggestion that this is somehow unfair to the governor is the most self-serving , ludicrous statement I have ever heard in my life . It could n't be fairer for this guy .

527,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963 . Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . But a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . Last week 's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki , a member of Kenya 's largest Kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe . The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya 's population . Mostly originating from Kenya 's central highlands , the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . Kenya 's first post-independence leader , Jomo Kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a Kikuyu . Kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of Kenyatta 's successor , Daniel Arap Moi , a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe , Kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected . This week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history . But the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . Kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy . However , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . E-mail to a friend",President Mwai Kibaki belongs to the influential and powerful Kikuyu tribe,a member of Kenya 's largest

Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother , according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York . In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department . Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer 's computer at the museum , according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement . The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are `` horrified '' by news of Singer 's arrest . They reported that he has been suspended from his post , effective immediately , and is barred from the property . Singer , 49 , was arrested at his home in Falls Church , Virginia , by federal agents , according to the prosecutors ' statement . Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging `` chats '' and e-mail communications with the undercover detective , posing as the woman and her daughter , from August to September . He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce . If convicted on each count , he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count , prosecutors said . Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective , posing as the mother , in an America On Line chat room called `` Cuties . '' The chat room attracts people who `` are known to trade in pornographic images , including child pornography , '' according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . `` On five separate occasions in August 2007 , Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter , including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation , '' prosecutors said . In his communications with the supposed daughter , Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy , authorities said . In August 2007 , he sent her two images featuring child pornography , according to the affidavit , with the instruction , `` just delete it when you are done . '' A search of Singer 's AOL account activity showed that from July to September , he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective , authorities said in the statement . Also , the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography . Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday . He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children 's Museum , but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months . He has been employed by the museum for four years , she said .

529,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus -LRB- HPV -RRB- has prompted a widespread freeze on the country 's national vaccination program . Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008 , the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers . More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service -LRB- NHS -RRB- started administering it in September 2008 . Natalie Morton 's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in Coventry . Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine , according to media reports . It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton 's death . Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death . Glaxo Smith Kline , the manufacturer of Cervarix , issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a `` precautionary measure . '' Watch reaction to Natalie Morton 's death '' `` At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown , '' the company said in a statement posted on their Web site . `` Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night , we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie 's death is conducted . '' On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations . `` As a purely precautionary measure , we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case , '' a spokesperson for the NHS said . `` Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches , they should continue with the vaccination program . '' Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine . What is HPV ? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus . Although there are more than 100 types of HPV , only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer . Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts . HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease . Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life , according to the British National Health Service . HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix . Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer . Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV . What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine ? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV -LRB- 16 and 18 -RRB- that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women . The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm , or thigh , in three doses within six months , and is recommended for teenage girls . How effective is the Cervarix vaccine ? According to the manufacturer , Glaxo Smith Kline , Cervarix is over 99 percent effective . Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV ? No . Gardisil , manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide . Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV -LRB- 16 , 18 , 6 and 11 -RRB- . Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions , such as genital warts . Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck . Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated , 32 deaths were reported , though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence . Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK ? According to the NHS , Cervarix , `` was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria . The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated . '' When was the vaccine introduced ? In September 2008 , England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13 , and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls . Do condoms protect against HPV ? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission , but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover . What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine ? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries , according to the NHS . The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site , nausea , a mild temperature , dizziness , diarrhea and muscle aches . In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred .",Does HPV cause 99 percent of cervical cancers ?,"since 2008 , the virus that causes 99 percent of"

Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles , her family by her side . She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet , he said . No funeral services are currently planned , Watt said , adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers . Arthur 's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear 's `` All in the Family '' as Edith Bunker 's cousin , and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series . In the '70s , `` Maude '' was ahead of the social curve , tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography , race relations and , in an episode titled `` Maude 's Dilemma , '' abortion . That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter -LRB- Bill Macy -RRB- decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child . But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women 's liberation -- a big deal for the shy , Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City . During the Depression , Arthur 's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge , Maryland . By the time she was 12 , Arthur was nearly 5 feet , 10 inches tall , and self-conscious about her height . But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting . Along the way , she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about , but she kept the last name -- Arthur . The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway . Critics delighted in her haughty , serpent-tongued deliveries . Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called `` Once Upon a Tune , '' but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on `` Studio One , '' `` Kraft Television Theatre '' and `` The Sid Caesar Show . '' Arthur drew attention in `` Threepenny Opera '' on Broadway with Lotte Lenya , but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in `` Fiddler on the Roof . '' In 1966 , Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play `` Mame , '' playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role . Eight years later , she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball , but by then she was already well-established as Maude . Arthur left `` Maude '' in 1978 , making television and some film appearances afterward . She starred in a short-lived series , `` Amanda 's , '' in 1983 and then joined the cast of `` The Golden Girls '' in 1985 with Betty White , Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty . Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida . -LRB- Getty played Arthur 's mother -RRB- . The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for `` Maude . '' Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season . White , McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show , renamed `` The Golden Palace , '' but the show lasted only one season without Arthur . Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992 , returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts . In the early part of this decade , Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows . Her last stage appearance was in 2006 . Her last television appearance was on `` The View '' in 2007 .",What was Bea Arthur known for ?,her roles as television 's `` Maude '' and the sardonic Dorothy
531,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cheryl Reed 's morning routine starts like that of millions of other mothers around the country . She makes breakfast for her 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter , piles them into a minivan and drops them off at school . Cheryl Reed has a rare form of breast cancer that mostly affects young African-American women . It 's the next stop that sets Reed apart from other women . Three weeks a month , she heads to the infusion center at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , for chemotherapy treatments . Reed , 40 , has breast cancer ; not just any form of the disease , but a rare , aggressive and difficult to treat version called triple negative . Of the estimated 180,000 women who learn they have invasive breast cancer this year in the United States , about 15 percent will have triple negative . Like Reed , the majority of triple negative patients will be young African-American women . `` It never occurred to me that I 'm going to die from this , '' Reed said . `` I was like , ` I 've got breast cancer , let 's take care of it . ' '' Reed did take care of it . For eight months during 2006 , she endured chemotherapy and radiation treatments . She thought the cancer was in remission , but it returned last November . This time , it had spread to her liver , lungs and chest wall . `` Triple negative cancers do tend to be aggressive in their natural histories , so they have a very high rate of recurrence or relapsing , '' explained Dr. Ruth O'Regan , Reed 's oncologist at the Winship Institute . She 's one of several breast cancer experts around the country who are trying to learn more about what causes triple negative and how to treat it more effectively . Dr. Funmi Olopade , a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago , was at the forefront of identifying triple negative and the trend among African-American women . She said what makes it different from other types of breast cancer is that women with the disease lack three hormone receptors known to fuel most breast cancer tumors : estrogen , progesterone and HER2 . Health Minute : More on triple negative breast cancer '' `` When you have triple negative , it means that we can not use hormone therapy . ... The only way we can treat that type of breast cancer is to use chemotherapy , '' Olopade said . Tamoxifen and Herceptin , two of the most effective medications for treating breast cancer , do n't work for triple negative breast cancer patients . But if a patient responds well to chemotherapy , Olopade said , there 's a very good chance of curing the disease . `` The challenge we have is when the cancer comes back , '' she added . `` Right now , we do n't have any effective way to treat it , and that 's why when it comes back , it tends to be deadly . '' Reed is enrolled in a clinical trial at the Winship center where she 's receiving chemotherapy along with a drug called Avastin , which cuts the blood supply to cancer cells . Olopade is hoping better drugs will be available in the next two to five years that will help eradicate triple negative cancer cells . In the meantime , she stressed , early detection is the key to recovery , especially for women at highest risk . `` In this country , what we have found was young African-American women have a rate that is higher than young white women , and we do n't know if that is because of a gene or other risk factors , '' Olopade said . `` We know that women with a family history of breast cancer who have a BRCA1 mutation are most at risk , '' she said . BRCA1 is a major breast cancer-causing gene that was identified 14 years ago . Olopade said women born with the defective gene have a higher chance of getting breast cancer and at a younger age . Olopade also wants to explore further whether triple negative rates are higher among women who do not breastfeed their children . `` It 's that first pregnancy and first breastfeeding that really allows the breast to become fully mature , '' she said . She worried that in general , `` African-Americans are not likely to breastfeed , as they are getting in the work force and returning to work soon after childbirth . '' Even with several clues , Olopade acknowledged that researchers still do n't know a lot about triple negative breast cancer and more study is needed . She encouraged all young women , no matter what their race , to talk to their doctor about doing a risk assessment for the BRCA1 gene . If there is a family history of the gene mutation , some physicians may tell a woman not wait until she turns 40 to get her first mammogram . `` We begin screening as early at 25 , '' Olopade said . `` Many of the women are surviving . They are beating the odds of dying because they know they can do preventive approaches to reduce their risk of dying . '' Reed is trying to increase her chances of survival by getting experimental treatment in the clinical trial . She seems to be responding well , but she 's realistic . `` There 's always the possibility that once this is done , it could be two years and I 'm back in treatment again , '' she said . `` It really is a part of my life now . ... I 'm a survivor .

534,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British authorities and environmental groups were welcoming the launch this week of the world 's first biodegradable chewing gum , which they say could help save some of the millions spent on clearing up the mess ordinary gum creates . Manufacturers say the gum decomposes within six weeks . The new gum becomes non-adhesive when dry and decomposes to dust within six weeks , a spokesman for Mexico 's Chicza Mayan Rainforest Chewing Gum told CNN . The makers of Chicza say it is the first biodegradable chewing gum ever sold . Environmental and waste management groups told CNN that they , too , believe it is a first . Unlike other gums that contain petrochemicals the natural gum is produced from the sap of the chicozapote tree found in the Mexican rainforest , a spokesman for Chicza told CNN . A spokesman for campaign group Keep Britain Tidy told CNN they welcome any product that can help eradicate the staining on pavements caused by dropped chewing gum . Removing chewing gum litter costs local authorities # 150 million -LRB- $ 222 million -RRB- a year , a spokesman for the Local Government Association told CNN . Sixty-five percent of British streets have chewing gum stuck on them , a spokesman from Keep Britain Tidy told CNN . One of the worst-affected areas is Westminster in central London , where a comprehensive gum clean-up would cost # 9 million -LRB- $ 13.4 million -RRB- , according to Westminster City Council . `` Gum litter is a constant problem for us , especially given the vast number of visitors to Westminster every day . We spend # 100,000 -LRB- $ 148,000 -RRB- a year cleaning ugly blobs of conventional chewing gum off our streets , '' Westminster City Councilor Danny Chalkley said in a written statement . `` It 's an incredibly expensive and time-consuming task , so anything that could reduce the problem is very welcome indeed . '' he said . British parliamentarians have called on the government to introduce a tax on chewing gum , with the money raised going toward the cost of gum removal . In Britain , offenders can be fined up to # 80 -LRB- $ 119 -RRB- for discarding used chewing gum on a street . The producer of the new gum is Consorcio Chiclero , which comprises 46 cooperatives with around 2,000 chicleros farmers , working in an area of 1.3 million hectares of rainforest , according to a statement from Chicza . Locals have been extracting the natural chicle gum base from the bark of the chicozapote trees for a century , a spokesman for Chicza told CNN . After years of exporting the gum base to be used as an ingredient in the manufacture of regular chewing gum , the cooperative recently decided to start making its own gum using only chicle gum base and natural flavorings and sweeteners , Chicza said . The company launched its gum in Britain this week . It is available at a chain of supermarkets and Mexican restaurants . The Chicza gum sells for # 1.39 -LRB- $ 2.06 -RRB- for a pack of 12 squares .",How long do manufacturers say it takes for the new Mexican product to decompose ?,within six weeks
535,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia 's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar , the president 's hometown , after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday . An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu , Somalia , on Saturday . Jowhar is a major town 55 miles -LRB- 88 kilometers -RRB- southeast of Mogadishu , the capital . `` All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets , '' a local journalist said . The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government , which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu . Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union , which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006 . The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network , and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006 . After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday , the rebels started conducting `` search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town , '' the journalist added . The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town , where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces , said the journalist , who requested anonymity for safety reasons . The town 's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia 's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia , which has waged days-long attacks in the capital . In the latest round of violence , one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday . Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded , Somali officials said Friday . The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991 . Last week , a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters . `` It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government , '' said Sheikh Hassan Ya ` qub , a spokesman for Al-Shabab . `` There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us . '' The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia , or Islamic law , the spokesman said . Somalia 's new president , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , recently approved implementing sharia , but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form . Meanwhile , a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government . The warlord , Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade , was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys , who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist .",Who is the leader of Al-Shabab ?,Sheikh Sharif Ahmed

The day before , airlines offered extra flights to leave the area . Lionel Alvarez , who runs a resort hotel called `` Las Ventanas al Pariaso '' in the town of San Jose del Cabo , found a silver lining to the coming storm . `` The wind is refreshing a little bit because of the high temperatures we 've gone through in the past few days , '' he said . But Alvarez , like other locals , had work to do in preparation of Jimena . `` We protect the property by dismantling all that could be dangerous , fly or can be broken , '' he said . Authorities had asked about 10,000 people to evacuate the area , but many had decided to wait out the storm . Cuauhtemoc Morgan , a local resident of Los Cabos who sent videos to to CNN 's iReport , said residents had protected every home in his neighborhood , fortifying windows with masking tape .

538,"DUBAI , United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on Tuesday accused the international media of `` exaggerating '' the situation in Darfur to detract from atrocities in Iraq , the Palestinian territories and Somalia . Refugees from Darfur gather at a camp in Chad . Sudan 's president says the crisis in Darfur is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir spoke at a news conference in Dubai following a three-day visit to the Persian Gulf emirate . He said the crisis in Sudan 's western Darfur region is a `` media fabrication . '' El-Bashir 's government has been blamed by the United Nations of supporting militias that conduct `` indiscriminate attacks '' on civilians in the Darfur region , including torture , rape , and killings . Rebels fighting the government-backed militias have also been accused by the U.N. of widespread human rights abuses . During Tuesday 's news conference , el-Bashir restated his position that foreign intervention in Darfur was an obstacle in achieving peace in the region . The Sudanese president has been outspoken in his opposition to allowing non-African forces in Darfur . At the start of this year , more than 9,000 members of a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force were deployed to the region to address the fighting and humanitarian suffering . The force will eventually number 26,000 . Speaking on Tuesday , el-Bashir said that the fighting only affects 10 percent of the region . In the majority of Darfur , there is little to no conflict and people are living normal lives , he said . Citing Sudanese government statistics , el-Bashir said that less than 10,000 people have died in the conflict and less than 500,000 have been displaced . International figures , including United Nations ' data , put the death toll in Darfur at approximately 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced by the violence since 2003 . The conflict started five years ago when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms , complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government . Sudan 's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing the tribal militias known as janjaweed , which have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur 's local communities . El-Bashir , however , rejected claims that the Darfur conflict is being fought along ethnic lines .

Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout , spokesman Arturo Sandoval said . At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez 's dad , Sandoval said . The father , Raul Ramirez Alvarado , 35 , died in the driver 's seat . The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle , but was apparently shot in the back , Sandoval said . The boy 's body fell forward in front of the vehicle . The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday . No arrests had been made as of Tuesday , the spokesman said . Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso , Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN . `` It 's a senseless tragedy that we 're trying to come to terms with , '' she said . According to El Paso County records , Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed . The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso , Ayala said . It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district . Raul 's classmates were spared the details of his death , but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy 's passing . Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers , Ayala said . More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez , out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people . A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world . According to statistics from local prosecutors , Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day . The bloodiest month this year has been September , with 476 killings reported . The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso , but as Friday 's shooting showed , the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other . Because of the ongoing investigation , Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father , but added that at least 90 percent of the city 's homicides are drug-related . Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year . In early 2009 , a 3-year-old girl was killed together with her father inside a vehicle that was targeted , Sandoval said .",How many were slain in Jaurez this year ?,"More than 2,200 killings"

The State Department has not commented on her travel plans . Making Asia Clinton 's first overseas destination illustrates the Obama administration 's desire for a broader partnership with China and its commitment to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue , as well as strengthening ties with Tokyo and Seoul , the diplomats said . The White House said President Barack Obama told Chinese President Hu Jintao in a Friday phone call that he looked forward to `` to early contacts and exchanges between senior officials of our two countries .

541,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After nearly 40 years of recorded increases , the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008 , recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show . The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased , partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election . According to the Census Bureau 's American Community Survey , the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008 , down from 12.6 percent in 2007 . Taking into account the margin of error , it was possible that the immigrant population remained even . `` Between '07 and '08 there really was n't that much of a change , '' said Elizabeth Grieco , chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau . But given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970 , no change is big news . The American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year , and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population , according to the bureau . The survey does n't give a reason for the leveling off , but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift . `` The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants ' decisions on whether to come to the U.S. , '' said Michelle Mittelstadt , director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute . Would-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now , Mittelstadt said . The largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession , including California , Florida and Arizona . Mittelstadt noted , however , that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying . A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico , the largest source of immigrants to the United States , slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008 , based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico , as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures . The Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008 , according to census data . The new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005 , the number of noncitizens decreased , Grieco said . There were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008 , down from 21.9 million in 2007 . The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants . Along with the decline in the noncitizen population , however , there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens , Grieco said . The number of individuals who are naturalized citizens increased to 43 percent of the foreign-born population in 2008 from 42.5 percent in 2007 . The Census survey matches reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the rise of naturalization applications . `` Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008 , with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States , '' according to a DHS statement . A significant fee increase imposed in 2007 for naturalization applications and an awareness of citizenship brought on during voter registration drives for the 2008 election help explain the increase , Mittelstadt said .",what was there an increase in ?,The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased
542,"SEOUL , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tens of thousands of South Koreans were demonstrating Saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government 's decision to import what they say is unsafe U.S. beef . South Korean protesters protest against government 's policy on U.S. beef imports on Saturday . South Korean police estimate that the crowd in Seoul is about 50,000 . No clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police , although ongoing protests have at times turned violent . South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban . That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the United States in 2003 . The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak , who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his Cabinet . Tens of thousands of auto workers in South Korea went on strike Wednesday to oppose the government 's lifting of the ban . After a series of negotiations , Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old . Animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease , which can be transmitted to humans . The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease . The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports . Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals . The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997 . Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a rare and fatal malady in humans . Until the 2003 ban , South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters . South Korea 's new pro-U.S. president agreed to lift the import ban in April before a summit with U.S. President George W. Bush . But the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks , along with a sense that South Korea had backed down too easily to American pressure . The government has vowed to get tough with the rallies . In Washington , the White House announced that Bush would visit South Korea on August 5-6 before heading to the Beijing Olympics . Bush had originally been expected to go to Seoul next week when he visits Japan for the G-8 summit , but the trip did not materialize amid the protests .

It is not the first time Sanlu has been connected to a scandal involving tainted milk powder , according to China Daily . In 2004 , at least 13 infants in the eastern Anhui province died of malnutrition after drinking milk powder that had little to no nutrition . The illegally manufactured milk was falsely labeled with the Sanlu brand , according to the paper . More than 170 other babies were hospitalized as a result of drinking the cheap milk powder . Chinese police have questioned 78 people -- including dairy farmers and milk dealers -- about the most recent contamination , a Chinese official told Xinhua Saturday . Sanlu would not say whether its employees are being investigated , Xinhua said . Testing by Sanlu found tripolycyanamide , also known as melamine , in 700 tons of its product , said Zhao Xinchao , the vice mayor of Shijiazhuang , the news agency reported . Zhao told the news agency that the suspects added water to the milk they sold to Sanlu to make more money , then added the chemical so the diluted milk could still meet standards . Inspectors found the chemical in Sanlu infant formula produced by one of the company 's partner producers in northwest Gansu Province , an official said Sunday . Two of 12 samples randomly selected from the Sanlu milk powder produced by the Haoniu Dairy Company in Jiuquan City tested positive for melamine , said Xian Hui , the vice-governor of Gansu . Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones , urinary tract ulcers , and eye and skin irritation . The chemical is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants . Hundreds of Wal-Mart and Carrefour stores in China are pulling the Sanlu milk powder from their shelves , Xinhua said . This episode marks the latest in a string of tainted products produced in China . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recalled more than 150 brands of cat and dog food last year after finding that some pets became ill or died after eating food tainted with melamine , the same chemical found in the powdered milk . Two Chinese businesses , a U.S. company and top executives of each were indicted by a federal grand jury in February in connection with tainted pet food , which resulted in deaths and serious illnesses in up to thousands of U.S. pets , federal prosecutors said . In October 2007 , regulators and retailers in the United States recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . In November , shipments of the popular toy Aqua Dots were found to have been contaminated with a toxic chemical that turned into a powerful `` date rape '' drug if swallowed , causing some children who ate the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness . And in February , a Maryland candy distributor pulled Pokemon-brand Valentine lollipops from store shelves after bits of metal were found in the sealed treats , authorities said . Officials on Monday announced the death of a second child who consumed contaminated milk powder . Of the more than 1,200 others who have been sickened , 340 infants were hospitalized , and 53 considered to be in serious condition , according to China 's Health Ministry . Government inspectors were testing baby formula around China and plan to release their results on Tuesday , said Li Changjiang , head of the State Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine , according to the Xinhua news agency . The manufacturer , Sanlu Group , has recalled more than 8,200 tons of the tainted formula following reports of babies developing kidney stones , Xinhua said .

545,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as `` a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .",What did the lawsuit challenge ?,federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman
546,"London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A comprehensive new study identifying the most threatened sea turtle populations worldwide has been published by conservationists . The report , jointly produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature -LRB- IUCN -RRB- , the Marine Turtle Specialist Group -LRB- MTSG -RRB- , Conservation International -LRB- CI -RRB- and the U.S. 's National Fish and Wildlife Foundation , is the first detailed appraisal of global sea turtle populations , say the authors , and will provide a blueprint for future conservation efforts . `` This assessment system provides a baseline status for all sea turtles from which we can gauge our progress on recovering these threatened populations in the future , '' Roderic Mast , co-chair of the MTSG and vice-president of CI said in a statement . `` Through this process , we have learned a lot about what is working and what is n't in sea turtle conservation , so now we look forward to turning the lessons learned into sound conservation strategies for sea turtles and their habitats , '' Mast added . Almost half of the world 's most threatened sea turtle species can be found in the northern waters of the Indian Ocean and on nesting beaches lying within Exclusive Economic Zones in countries such as India , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh , according to the report . Threatened populations here include both loggerhead turtles -LRB- classified `` endangered '' by the IUCN Red List -RRB- and ridley turtles -LRB- `` vulnerable '' -RRB- . `` The report confirms that India is a home to many of the most threatened sea turtles in the world , '' B. C. Choudhury , from the Wildlife Institute of India said in a statement . `` This paper is a wake-up call for the authorities to do more to protect India 's sea turtles and their habitats to ensure that they survive , '' he added . Other hotspots for sea turtles include the east Pacific Ocean -LRB- running from the U.S. to South America -RRB- and the east Atlantic Ocean -- specifically off the coast of western Africa . According to the report , threats to sea turtles vary from region to region but can be broadly categorized . These include accidental -LRB- caught in fishing nets -RRB- and deliberate targeting -LRB- for trades in eggs , meat and shells -RRB- , coastal development , pollution and climate change . Join Philippe Cousteau for `` Your Green World '' As well as highlighting danger areas , the report also pinpoints regions which are supporting healthier populations which face relatively low threats . Species including the hawksbill turtle and the green turtle are thriving in nesting sites and feeding areas in Australia , Mexico and Brazil , along with southwestern Indian Ocean , Micronesia -LRB- in Oceania -RRB- and French Polynesia . The report helps set up `` priorities for different populations in different regions , '' says Bryan Wallace , director of science for the marine flagship species program at CI and lead author of the report . `` Sea turtles everywhere are conservation-dependent , but this framework will help us effectively target our conservation efforts around the world , '' Wallace said in a statement .

549,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi had been on the run for months , as opposition fighters aided by NATO airstrikes pushed him and his supporters from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and other long-time strongholds . Finally , on Thursday , the long-time Libyan leader 's life ended around where it began -- in Sirte , the coastal city where he was born . Here is a timeline of some key moments leading up to Gadhafi 's death , according to Libya 's interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , other National Transitional Council officials and other sources : -- Having taken over the city of Bani Walid earlier in the week , fighters aligned with Libya 's National Transitional Council turn their attention on Sirte -- the last holdout of Gadhafi loyalists . -- French fighter jets and a Predator drone , firing a Hellfire missile , strike a convoy near Sirte on Thursday morning , a U.S. Defense official says . That official is unable to say if Gadhafi was in the targeted envoy . But a senior NATO official says that Gadhafi was part of that convoy and survived the attack . -- Around noon on Thursday , transitional council officials announce that their fighters have taken control of Sirte , despite pockets of resistance . There is no official word then about Gadhafi . -- During the day Thursday , Gadhafi is captured alive and in good health in Sirte , according to the interim prime minster . -- According to Ali Aujali , Libya 's ambassador to the United States , troops find Gadhafi during the day in a large drainage pipe in Sirte . Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte later tells CNN 's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand . -- Gadhafi is alive and in good health when he 's captured , according to the interim prime minster . -- He does not resist arrest . -- At the time , he is wearing an undershirt and trousers and carrying a gun . -- While being transferred to a vehicle -- destined for Misrata , Jibril says later -- Gadhafi is shot in the right arm . -- Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks shows a bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi being hauled onto a truck . -- Eventually , National Transitional Council forces put Gadhafi into the vehicle . As soon as it takes off , a firefight erupts involving council forces and those loyal to Gadhafi . -- Caught in the crossfire , Gadhafi is shot in the head . -- He dies a few moments before arriving at a hospital , a coroner says , according to Jibril . Another video shows a dead Gadhafi with what appears to be a head wound . -- At the hospital , DNA samples are taken -- including blood and saliva -- that confirm that the dead man is indeed Moammar Gadhafi . -- Council representatives get in touch with the International Criminal Court , which had charged Gadhafi with war crimes . After sending the coroner 's report and photos , the court gives Libyan authorities permission to bury Gadhafi . -- Soon after the news breaks on Thursday afternoon , crowds throughout Libya erupt in celebration of Gadhafi 's death .",Where was Gadhafi found ?,Sirte
551,"MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gunmen shot and killed 17 patients and wounded two others in a drug rehabilitation center in northern Mexico late Wednesday , the mayor of Ciudad Juarez said Thursday . Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , late Wednesday . Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said authorities believe a rival drug gang attacked the men at the El Aviane rehab facility . `` At the very least , it was one organized crime group thinking that another group was operating in that place , '' Reyes told CNN . Wednesday night 's shootings , he said , are similar to an attack at a drug facility in March that left 20 patients dead . A Mexican civic group said last week that Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas , had the most slayings per capita in 2008 of any city in the world . Watch scene at rehab center after shootings '' More than 1,420 people have been killed in Juarez this year , Reyes told CNN on Monday . About 1,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2008 , Reyes said . The latest Juarez killings came on the same day that gunmen shot dead the No. 2 security official and three others in Michoacan , the home state of Mexican President Felipe Calderon . Jose Manuel Revuelta Lopez , the deputy public safety secretary of Mexico 's Michoacan state , was killed in a shootout that also claimed the lives of two of his bodyguards and a bystander caught in the crossfire , said Jesus Humberto Adame Ortiz , spokesman for the state . Revuelta was leaving his office at 5:15 p.m. in the state capital , Morelia , when the shooting occurred , Adame said . An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since Calderon declared war on drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006 . More than 11,000 people have since died , about 1,000 of them police . The offensive against the government has been especially fierce in Michoacan . In July , La Familia Michoacana drug cartel was accused of assaults in a half-dozen cities across the state and of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents and dumping their bodies on a remote road . That violence was thought to have been retaliation for the arrest of a La Familia leader . In Juarez , much of the violence is being committed by the rival Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels , which are fighting for lucrative routes into the United States as well as local street sales , Reyes said . The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security , he said . In the past 45 days , 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years , Reyes said . `` We do n't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not , '' he told CNN . `` We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails . They end up in the city of Juarez , and that 's a problem generated for us , but also for the United States . '' Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally , but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs , which have networks in the United States , Reyes said . According to a report released last week by the Mexican Citizens Council for Public Security watchdog group , Juarez had an estimated rate of 130 killings per 100,000 people . The city has a population of around 1.5 million . By comparison , the homicide rate in New Orleans , Louisiana , the deadliest city in the United States in 2008 , was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents , based on preliminary FBI figures .

555,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1,100 people worldwide have died from swine flu since it emerged in Mexico and the U.S. in April , according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization . A young girl wears a mask at a hospital in Hanoi . Vietnam reported its first death from swine flu this week . As of July 31 , the total number of victims killed by the H1N1 virus , also known as swine flu , stood at 1,154 -- an increase of 338 since WHO 's previous update on July 27 . The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed , spreading as widely in six weeks as common influenza viruses spread in the six months , according to WHO . WHO data showed the total number of laboratory confirmed cases at 162,380 , but the number could be higher since individual cases no longer have to be tested or reported . The total number of countries and territories reporting at least one case of infection now stands at 168 , with new cases reported in Azerbaijan , Gabon , Grenada , Kazakhstan , Moldova , Monaco , Nauru , Swaziland and Suriname . In the United States , federal health officials are worried about the upcoming flu season . They say nearly 160 million Americans may need to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus , but it wo n't be as simple as a single shot . In a background briefing with reporters on Tuesday , two senior administration officials said the vaccine , which is still in clinical trials , would require two shots . The first shot would be followed by a second shot three weeks later . Immunity to the virus would finally kick in two weeks after that . That means someone who is vaccinated by the time the program is expected to launch in late October wo n't get protection until late fall . On Tuesday , British-based pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline announced it had signed contracts with nine governments to provide 96 million doses of a H1N1 vaccine and was in ongoing discussions with governments to provide further supplies . GlaxoSmithKline has already signed deals worth $ 250 million in total to provide 195 million doses and plans to donate 50 million doses to the World Health Organization . `` First supplies of the vaccine will be available to governments from September onwards , with shipments expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 , '' GlaxoSmithKline said in a statement . `` The exact pace of delivery will be dependent on capacity and the yield of the influenza strain . '' Details of the immunization program were revealed as part of the government 's overall plan to deal with what is expected to be a difficult flu season . The federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week issued sweeping guidelines for a vaccination campaign against the swine flu strain , identifying more than half the population as targets for the first round of vaccinations . The priority groups include pregnant women , health care and emergency services personnel , children , adolescents and young adults from six months to 24 years of age , household and caregiver contacts of children younger than six months and healthy adults with certain medical conditions . The symptoms of swine flu are similar to that of seasonal flu and include fever , cough , sore throat , aches and runny nose , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . A significant number of infected people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting .",What is the number of vaccines available by the company ?,96 million doses
556,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man police say kidnapped and brutally murdered a 7-year-old Georgia girl pleaded guilty Tuesday and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Ryan Brunn entered the plea at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse , during which he described in detail how he enticed , molested and killed Jorelys Rivera . The girl 's mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing on December 2 from an apartment complex in Canton , which is about 40 miles north of Atlanta . Brunn , 20 , who worked as a maintenance man at the same apartment complex , was arrested on December 7 and charged with the crime . He told the court he had never talked to Jorelys before the day of her murder . He said he devised a plan after he found one of her skates . Brunn took a picture of the skate and approached her with it , asking if the skate was hers . She said yes , and Brunn promised to take her to it . Instead , he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants . He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor . At this point , she was still alive , he told the court . So Brunn took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate . He said he did not have sex with the girl . Next , Brunn put Jorelys ' body in a plastic bag and loaded it into his maintenance golf cart . He put the body in the trash compactor and operated the machine . He then went home and hung out with friends . Later , he again operated the compactor . Increasingly , Brunn told the court , he grew concerned about what he had done . So he took a receipt , wrote on the back of it , `` She is in the trash can , '' and taped it to the compactor . He admitted lying to investigators who had questioned him about the case . Brunn said he knew right from wrong . During his testimony , relatives of the slain girl were visibly upset , crying and shaking . `` I would like to apologize for everything I have done , '' Brunn told her family in court . Last week , he was indicted on 13 counts including murder , aggravated assault , cruelty to children , aggravated child molestation , enticing a child for indecent purposes , false imprisonment , abandonment of a dead body , making a false statement and sexual exploitation of children . According to the indictment , Jorelys was severely beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the face , neck and chest . Brunn 's attorney had said previously he planned to plead not guilty . Brunn had no known criminal history , authorities have said .",What is Brunn 's sentence ?,life in prison without the possibility of parole

With friends and family looking on , the 55-year-old jurist took the judicial oath in the court 's wood-paneled East Conference Room , pledging to `` faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me . '' It was the first time such a ceremony was televised . Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 62-word oath required of all federal judges . In a private ceremony just moments before , Sotomayor took a separate , constitutional oath across the hall . Both oaths are necessary for her to assume her new duties . As her mother , Celina , held a ceremonial Bible , Sotomayor beamed as she waved to relatives and guests when she entered the room for the public ceremony . Among those in the room was her brother , Juan Sotomayor .

Democrats continued to praise Sotomayor as a fair and impartial jurist with an extraordinary life story . Many Republicans portrayed her as a judicial activist intent on reinterpreting the law to conform with her own liberal political beliefs . See how Sotomayor measures up to other justices '' Sotomayor 's confirmation capped an inspiring personal and professional journey . Her parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II . Her father worked in a factory and did not speak English well . She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project , not too far from the stadium of her favorite team , the New York Yankees . Her father died when she was 9 . Her mother , whom Sotomayor has described as her biggest inspiration , worked six days a week as a nurse to care for her and her younger brother . Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and attended Yale Law School , where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal . She worked at nearly every level of the judicial system over a three-decade career before being tapped by Obama . Her supporters touted her as someone with bipartisan favor and historic appeal .

558,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe , authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado 's Jensen Farms is safe . But if in doubt about a fruit 's origin , they said , it 's best to throw it out . The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12 . As of Wednesday , it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people , officials with the Centers for Disease Control said . The number of cases is expected to rise , as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms . All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada , Colorado , although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois , Wyoming , Tennessee , Utah , Texas , Colorado , Minnesota , Kansas , New Mexico , North Carolina , Missouri , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Arizona , New Jersey , New York and Pennsylvania . `` It 's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms , then it 's OK to eat , '' CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday . `` But if you 're in doubt , then throw it out . '' The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says , `` Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe , '' or a gray , yellow and green sticker that says , `` Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords . '' But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker , Frieden said . Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from . If the cantaloupe 's origins remain unconfirmed , it should be disposed of , he said . However , the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation 's food supply is decreasing , thanks to the fruit 's short shelf life -- about two weeks , officials said . The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10 , `` so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product , '' Sherri McGarry , a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- , told reporters . The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves , she said , but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer . `` But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect , '' she said . If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms , authorities recommend they do n't try to wash off the bacteria . `` We want you to throw that product away , '' McGarry said . The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can , to prevent people or animals from eating them , the CDC said . Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria , which can grow even at low temperatures , officials said . And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator , the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow . `` It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces '' in order to minimize risk , the FDA says on its website . After washing refrigerators , cutting boards and countertops , the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used . Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season , so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market , FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday . Although Jensen Farms does produce other products , there is no concern for any other product from the company , McGarry said . Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults , the CDC said , but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems . It can be treated with antibiotics . The source of the outbreak -- the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation . Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled .","If there is any doubt about a cantaloupe 's origin , what do officials say should be done with it ?",throw it out
559,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness . A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo . That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals , including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas . The 452-page report states that `` scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans . '' The report , compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ' Illnesses , fails to identify any cure for the malady . It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time . `` Today 's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War , '' said Anthony Hardie , a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare . `` This is a bittersweet victory , -LSB- because -RSB- this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along , '' Hardie said at a news conference in Washington . `` Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans . '' The committee 's report , titled `` Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans , '' was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake . Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a `` renewed federal research commitment '' to `` identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . '' Watch CNN 's Elizabeth Cohen report more on Gulf War illness '' According to the report , Gulf War illness is a `` complex of multiple concurrent symptoms '' that `` typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems , chronic headaches , widespread pain , gastrointestinal problems , and other chronic abnormalities . '' The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -LRB- ALS -RRB- -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts . The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple `` biological alterations '' affecting the brain and nervous system . iReport.com : Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness ? While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease , it is , according to the report , no longer difficult to identify a cause . The report identifies two Gulf War `` neurotoxic '' exposures that `` are causally associated with Gulf War illness . '' The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide -LRB- PB -RRB- pills , given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents . The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict . The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link . The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran 's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time . `` Gulf War illness is n't some imaginary syndrome , '' said Ken Robinson , the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97 . `` This is real , and it has devastated families . Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration . Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again . '' Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness , because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991 . The report backs Robinson 's conclusion , noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq . The committee report also backs Robinson 's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness . Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a `` renewed federal research commitment '' to `` identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . '' Specifically , the report calls for at least $ 60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans .",which is the disease Gulf ?,War illness
561,"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The 2012 box office got off to a fine start this weekend , as Paramount 's `` found footage '' -LRB- riiiight ... -RRB- horror movie `` The Devil Inside , '' which the studio acquired for just under $ 1 million , earned a tremendous $ 34.5 million in its first three days , becoming the first breakout box office star since `` The Lion King 3D . '' In fact , the strong debut marks the third-best January opening of all time behind `` Cloverfield '' -LRB- $ 40.1 million -RRB- and a re-release of `` Star Wars '' -LRB- $ 35.9 million -RRB- . Is this a sign of things to come in 2012 ? Perhaps . But it 's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies . Demonic tales have made a mini-comeback in the last few years -- starting with the success of 2005 ′ s `` The Exorcism of Emily Rose , '' which earned $ 75.1 million domestically . Since then , similar titles like 2009 ′ s `` The Haunting in Connecticut '' -LRB- $ 55.4 million -RRB- , 2010 ′ s `` The Last Exorcism '' -LRB- $ 41 million -RRB- , and 2011 ′ s `` Insidious '' -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets . `` Insidious , '' for example , cost just $ 1.5 million to make . Of course , the `` Paranormal Activity '' movies -LRB- the fourth of which was just announced this week -RRB- are the biggest success stories of this whole trend . A total of $ 8 million has been spent making the three `` found footage '' movies , yet they have earned $ 296.7 million domestically . Paramount marketed `` The Devil Inside '' in much the same way the studio markets the `` Paranormal '' films . Commercials included ample shots of audiences screaming at the screen , and viewers were encouraged to use social media to chat up the film with the `` Tweet Your Scream '' campaign . Indeed , all the promotional costs -- certainly a much higher number than the budget -- helped `` The Devil Inside '' achieve a stellar debut , but where does it go from here ? Well , it falls . Fast . Due to their overwhelmingly young audiences , who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend , horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office , but `` The Devil Inside , '' with its utterly terrible `` F '' CinemaScore grade -LRB- some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an `` F '' or closer to the `` C '' range -RRB- , will likely plummet even more quickly . Not that it really matters , though -- the horror pic is already in the black , and it may finish with as much as $ 70 million . In second place , `` Mission : Impossible - Ghost Protocol , '' another Paramount film , continued its comeback performance with $ 20.5 million in its fourth weekend . The action blockbuster , which became the biggest hit of the holidays , has now earned $ 170.2 million , and it should finish well above $ 200 million . `` Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows '' held onto third place with a $ 14.1 million weekend . The sequel , which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original `` Sherlock Holmes , '' has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks . After two weekends , `` Shadows '' was trailing `` Sherlock Holmes '' by $ 59.7 million , but over the past two weeks , the sequel has narrowed that gap to $ 22.7 million , and it now has a running total of $ 157.4 million -- still disappointing , but not nearly the disaster it first appeared . `` The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo '' finished the frame in fourth place with $ 11.3 million , dipping only 24 percent , the smallest drop in the Top 10 . Could the edgy adaptation finally be finding its adult audience now that the warm n ' fuzzy holiday season is over ? After 19 days , `` Dragon Tattoo '' has grossed $ 76.8 million , and if it maintains strong holds like this , it should pass $ 100 million . `` Alvin and the Chipmunks : Chipwrecked '' rounds out the Top 5 . The kiddie threequel , which has majorly underperformed compared to expectations , dropped 42 percent to $ 9.5 million . It has now grossed $ 111.6 million total . The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing . Two of them , `` War Horse '' and `` We Bought A Zoo , '' are performing respectably , though . The films earned $ 8.6 and $ 8.5 million , respectively , this weekend , and they have nearly identical totals of $ 56.8 million and $ 56.6 million . Still , there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that `` War Horse '' -LRB- which cost $ 66 million -RRB- is performing admirably , while `` We Bought A Zoo '' -LRB- which cost $ 50 million -RRB- kind of fizzled , to which I say : Huh ?! In eighth place is a movie which has actually fizzled -- at least domestically . `` The Adventures of Tintin , '' Steven Spielberg 's expensive motion-capture animation , dropped 42 percent this weekend to $ 6.6 million and $ 61.9 million total . In ninth place , Focus Features ' `` Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy , '' which expanded into 809 theaters this weekend , performed admirably in its wider release . The well-reviewed spy drama maintained a robust $ 7,129 per theater average , giving the film a $ 5.8 million weekend and an early $ 10.4 million total after five weekends . `` New Year 's Eve '' held onto a spot in the Top 10 for one final weekend . The ensemble romantic comedy fell 48 percent to $ 3.3 million . The film has earned $ 52 million -LRB- less than half the gross of Valentine 's Day -RRB- , and it likely wo n't make it much further . 1 . The Devil Inside - $ 34.5 million 2 .

563,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities believe that a registered sex offender who this month admitted killing two California teenagers attempted to follow an 11-year-old girl walking home from school the day before one of the teens disappeared , according to documents filed in the case . John Albert Gardner , 31 , pleaded guilty April 16 to killing Chelsea King , 17 , and Amber Dubois , 14 . He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assault with intent to commit rape in a December incident involving a third woman . King was last seen leaving Poway High School in suburban San Diego , California , on February 25 . Her car , with her cell phone inside , was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park . King was known to run on the park 's trails . Her disappearance triggered a massive search that ended a few days later , when King 's remains were found in the park . Dubois disappeared in February 2009 while walking to school in Escondido , California . She was considered a missing person for more than a year until her remains were found in March . Prosecutors said Gardner led police to Dubois ' body after being assured that it would not be used against him in court . Gardner avoided the death penalty with his guilty plea but will be sentenced June 1 to two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole , under terms of the plea deal with prosecutors . On February 24 , a day before King went missing , an 11-year-old girl reported that she was walking home from school when she heard a vehicle slowly approaching her from behind , according to an affidavit requesting a police search of Gardner 's home , posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTLA-TV . The documents were unsealed Monday , KTLA reported . The girl told police the vehicle drove past her and then parked about 30 feet in front of her , the documents said . The driver stayed in the vehicle , the girl said , and did not attempt to speak to her . But a woman pulled up next to the girl and told her the person in the vehicle `` seemed very suspicious '' and offered to follow her home , according to the affidavit . The man , who was in a black car , then made a U-turn and left , and the woman followed the girl the remaining two blocks to her house , the documents said . The girl 's mother called police after her daughter told her what happened . The girl 's mother told authorities that after seeing a photo of Gardner following his arrest in the King case , her daughter said Gardner was `` the guy in the car , '' the affidavit said . Gardner 's girlfriend drives a black 2002 Nissan Sentra , according to the documents . The documents also detail the December assault on the third woman near where King 's car was found at the park . She told authorities she was on a hiking trail and a man walked past her , the affidavit said . She told him , `` Good morning , '' and he returned the greeting , but then tackled her from the side as he passed her , knocking her to the ground on her back . The man pinned her to the ground , and she screamed while struggling with him , the affidavit said . He told her to `` shut up , '' and she said , `` You 're going to have to kill me . '' `` That can be arranged , '' he responded . The man then demanded money from her , the affidavit said . She was able to sit up and used her elbow to strike him in the nose , telling police she felt `` the crunch of cartilage . '' The man let go of her and grabbed his nose , she said , and she ran . A woman also told police that she saw Gardner on the jogging trails near the park on the day King disappeared , the affidavit said . She said he was sitting and drinking a beer and had several empty beer cans around him . He warned her about a rattlesnake that was nearby , and they spoke briefly . The woman said she ran past the man and then talked to him some more on her return trip . The man was wearing blue jeans and a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt , she said , according to the affidavit . A second woman also recalled seeing a man in the Hard Rock Cafe shirt on a trail that day about 3 p.m. , about an hour and a half after the first woman said she saw him , the affidavit said . The same woman believes she saw King on the trail as well . Both women told police they were 100 percent sure the man they saw was Gardner , the affidavit said . The area where the second woman recalled seeing Gardner was `` 300 yards from where the panties of Chelsea King were found and about a mile from where the body of Chelsea King was found , '' the affidavit said . At the time of his arrest , Gardner was a registered sex offender . In 2000 he was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14 and a count of false imprisonment , according to a probation officer 's report . The victim in that case was a 13-year-old girl , who was molested and beaten when she tried to resist , the report said . `` The defendant ... manifests marked predatory traits and is not seen as a suitable candidate for sex offender treatment insofar as he refuses to accept any responsibility for what he has done , '' according to the 2000 report . Gardner knew the girl and was a former neighbor of hers , the report said . `` The fact that he would try to force himself on her sexually is indefensible but then to beat her as he did out of frustration ... represents a qualitative leap to extremely serious criminal behavior . '' The report recommended that Gardner be sentenced to six years in prison . KTLA reported that he served five years before being paroled .",who was scared off,John Albert Gardner
565,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Human rights and freedom of the press in China , the detention of terrorist suspects by the United States and Russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in Amnesty International 's annual report , released Wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . Amnesty International protestors outside the US Supreme Court in January dressed as Guantanamo Bay detainees . The 398-page report comes 60 years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and Amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` The biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . Irene Khan , Amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in Darfur , Zimbabwe , Gaza , Iraq and Myanmar demand immediate attention . '' The report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' According to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . Of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , Amnesty paid particular attention to China , the host of this summer 's Olympic Games . The group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in China in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including Tibetans , Falun Gong practitioners and Christians -- repressed or persecuted . Death penalty statistics in China are difficult to assess , Amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . Amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in China and said censorship of the Internet and other media intensified last year . `` The Chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` They decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . The authorities continued to block Web sites and to filter Internet content based on specified words and topics . '' Around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , Amnesty said . Amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the United States , where 42 people were executed last year . It noted New Jersey 's decision in December to abolish the death penalty made it the first U.S. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . As it has in previous annual reports , Amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . `` The USA must close Guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' Amnesty said . The group noted that Guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to U.S. courts . Most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , Amnesty said . In fact , more is written on the United States than any other country listed in the report . Asked about that at a press conference Tuesday , Khan said , `` We certainly devote a lot of time to Sudan , to China , to Zimbabwe and other countries . But we look to the U.S. to provide leadership around the world . Governments around the world look to the United States as a role model for their own behavior . '' In a lengthy section on Iraq , Amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` All sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . Abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million Iraqis to flee to Syria , Jordan and elsewhere , Amnesty said . U.S. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' In Afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` At least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including Afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' Russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , Amnesty said . `` The Russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` A crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the State Duma -LSB- parliament -RSB- elections in December . '' The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in Chechnya , Amnesty said . There were fewer reported disappearances in the Chechen Republic in 2007 than in previous years , Amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . The report also criticized human rights conditions in Iran , Gaza and Myanmar . Human rights conditions in Zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression . '' Members of the main opposition party , the MDC , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , Amnesty said . Some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in `` deplorable conditions '' while President Robert Mugabe 's government failed to remedy their situation . `` Human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us , '' Khan said . `` Governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the United Nations to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 60 years ago .

569,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera , a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means `` Shorty , '' is the most wanted man in Mexico . He 's also one of the most wanted men in the United States . Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel , which is battling for turf along the border . For five years , the State Department has kept a $ 5 million bounty on his head , calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security . Guzman , who leads the Sinaloa cartel , is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border . He recently upped the stakes , ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors , according to the Los Angeles Times . The cartel 's tentacles and those of its chief rival , the Gulf cartel , already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta , Georgia ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March . `` No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does , '' said Arabit , who heads the DEA 's office in this year 's border hot spot , El Paso , Texas . See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. . A December 2008 report by the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities . So far , the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico , where the cartels ' running gunbattles with police , the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year . It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007 . Once again , drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year , Arabit said . See who the key players are '' The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker , DEA agents say . But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire . `` It 's coming . I guarantee , it 's coming , '' said Michael Sanders , a DEA spokesman in Washington . Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman 's shoot-to-kill instructions are n't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals ; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials , the Los Angeles Times reported , citing sources and intelligence memos . The move is seen as dangerously brazen , the newspaper reported . In the past , the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement . U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border . The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $ 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border . But $ 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target . Guzman , who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel , is said to be worth $ 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade . He made this year 's Forbes list of the richest of the rich , landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell 's Soup fortune . Popular Mexican songs , called narcocorridos , embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader . `` Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico , '' said security consultant Scott Stewart , invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993 . Stewart , a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor , a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman 's worth . Just a decade ago , Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians , moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean . But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels . The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back . Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits . Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States , according to the DEA . Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine . Marijuana became the cartels ' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007 , bringing in $ 8.5 billion . Cocaine came in second , at $ 3.9 billion , and methamphetamine earned $ 1 billion , a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year . Watch how marijuana became the cartels ' top cash crop '' The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels , but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border , according to the DEA agents , local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN . The cartels ' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa , Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence . The status and alliances of the players continue to shift . Although the DEA and some analysts disagree , others say the Zetas , a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police , are now running the Gulf cartel . `` From what we 've seen , the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel , '' analyst Stewart said . `` In violent times , soldiers tend to rise to the top . '' These soldiers are incredibly well-armed , police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime `` Hummer '' Gonzalez Duran . It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles , including AK-47s ; 287 grenades ; two rocket launchers ; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition . At the very least , the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table . The DEA 's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate . Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , a former military man who is also known as `` El Lazco , '' or `` The Executioner . '' The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border 's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors . The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas ; Sonora Nogales , across from Nogales , Arizona ; and Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , California . Two years ago , the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo , across the border from Laredo , Texas . It 's all about the highways that help move the drugs . Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor , and Juarez has easy access to I-10 , a major east-west interstate , and I-25 , which runs north to Denver , Colorado . Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5 , which heads north all the way to the Canadian border . Some of the battles are internal , Arabit said . Some are with other cartels . And some , he said , can be attributed to the cartels ' `` desperate '' attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers . As soon as he took office in January 2007 , Calderon called out the cartels . He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and , in some cases , do the job of local police . Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office . The violence involves beheadings , running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches . Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight . The cartels ' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets . `` The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq , '' analyst Stewart said . `` It was simple machismo . The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas . '' When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s , the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant , beneficiaries of their location . Today , they are shadows of their former selves , weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders . Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997 . Known as `` The King of the Skies '' for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes , he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest . Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery . Two of them later were killed . His death , along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen , set the stage for the ongoing turf battle . When Cardenas was extradited in 2007 , Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales . Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston , Texas , where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros , Mexico . Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana , and last year , Guzman made a move on that plaza as well . `` Right now , they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar , '' said the DEA 's Elizabeth Kempshall , who heads the agency 's office in Phoenix , Arizona . Phoenix has become the nation 's kidnapping capital , largely because of the cartels ' increasing presence . Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition : `` That is the worst thing for any cartel leader , to face justice in the United States . '' CNN 's Eliott C.

572,"BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut , killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders , according to American and Lebanese officials . Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut . The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries , and the sole passenger walked away unscathed , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said . Both were Lebanese nationals , he said . An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries , the spokesman said . Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut 's Dora area , contradicting earlier reports of four . Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion , which was caused by a 15-kilogram -LRB- 33-pound -RRB- bomb placed in a car before the explosion , the security forces said . The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack , said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia . `` I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded , and certainly to the families of those who were killed , that our condolences are with them , '' she added . It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb . A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack , and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy . But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target . `` We do n't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened , who is responsible , who is exactly being targeted , '' he told reporters during the State Department 's daily briefing . `` We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us . '' Citing security concerns , McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman . A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night `` out of respect to the victims of today 's terrorist explosion . '' In addition to the American , an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast , according to a Western diplomatic source . Video of the scene showed several damaged cars , including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal . A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage . Mohammed Chatah , senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , pointed out that the attack happened during `` a major political crisis '' in Lebanon , which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud . `` This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation , '' Chatah told CNN . Tuesday 's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western , anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital . Most recently , an explosion in Beirut 's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj , the head of operations for the Lebanese army , and his bodyguard on December 12 . Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president . Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president .

575,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four active-duty U.S. soldiers -- three of them elite Army Rangers -- have been arrested and charged with planning to rob drug traffickers . A courtroom sketch shows David White , left , Stefan Champagne , center , and Carlos Lopez . Wearing street clothes , Rangers Carlos Lopez , 30 , and David Ray White , 28 , and Army medic Stefan Andre Champagne , 28 , appeared in federal court Friday . They 're charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and with carrying firearms in connection with that conspiracy . U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman ordered them held in custody until a preliminary hearing Wednesday . Another Ranger , Randy Spivey , 32 , is scheduled to appear in court Monday . `` It is a sad day when members of one of America 's most elite corps of soldiers , the Army Rangers , are alleged to have become involved in criminal activity , '' U.S. Attorney David E. Nahmias said of the case . `` These men were trained to defend the people and principles of this country , not to use their skills to steal cocaine from drug dealers at gunpoint . '' Lopez , White and Champagne were arrested Thursday at a storage facility in Sandy Springs , Georgia , a suburb just north of Atlanta , by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives who had set up a sting operation . Spivey was apprehended at Camp Frank D. Merrill , an Army Ranger training center in Dahlonega , Georgia , on Friday , the ATF said . Dahlonega is about 60 miles north of Atlanta . Lopez , White and Champagne were to commit the robbery while Spivey covered for them back at the camp , where the men are stationed , according to an affidavit filed with U.S. District Court . All four were to get a cut of the spoils of the robbery , the affidavit from ATF Agent Brett Turner says . The investigation began in November , when the ATF `` became aware '' that some soldiers were interested in robbing drug dealers of their cocaine , Turner says . He posed as a disaffected security guard for the drug traffickers who wanted to `` rip them off . '' The first try to set up the `` robbery '' failed , but a second attempt earlier this month succeeded , leading to the arrests at the storage facility and , a day later , the Ranger camp . A subsequent search found that Lopez , White and Champagne were carrying semiautomatic pistols and had an AR-15 assault rifle and a field pouch with 15 magazines of ammunition for it in their vehicle . Agents also found a ski mask , binoculars and a Taser among the items the men brought with them . The four soldiers face minimum mandatory sentences of 10 years in prison each for the drug conspiracy and an additional five years , consecutive , for the weapons allegation . The Army Rangers are an elite light infantry fighting force capable of deploying anywhere in the world within 18 hours . They became a permanent presence in the U.S. military in the 1970s . From the Colonial Era until that time , Rangers were activated for specific missions or conflicts and then deactivated when their work was completed .

576,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sugar lovers may have to face a bitter truth : The less sugar added to foods for typical people , the better are their blood-fat profiles and the lower are their cardiovascular risks , a study to be published Wednesday concludes . `` We found that the lower the amount of added sugar people ate , the better their good cholesterol and their blood triglyceride levels , '' said co-author Dr. Miriam B. Vos , assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , and author of `` The No-Diet Obesity Solution for Kids . '' Unfortunately for dessert lovers , the converse is true . Increased sugars are associated with important cardiovascular disease risk factors , according to the report . The authors cited lower levels of HDL-C , which is sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol , and higher levels of triglycerides . The study , to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , highlights a trend some nutritionists consider disturbing : In recent years , the typical American 's diet has increasingly incorporated added sugars . The authors defined them as `` caloric sweeteners used by the food industry and consumers as ingredients in processed or prepared foods to increase the desirability of those foods . '' Data from the mid-1990s show that 15.8 percent of the typical American 's diet was composed of added sugar -- 21.4 teaspoons or 359 calories per day . That 's up from 10.6 percent in 1977-1978 . Added sugars have been linked to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay . The researchers studied 6,113 adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . Interviewers called them and asked what they had eaten the previous day , then estimated the total added sugar in each person 's diet . Participants were then separated into groups : Those who got less than 5 percent of total calories from added sugar ; 5 percent to less than 10 percent ; 10 percent to less than 17.5 percent ; 17.5 percent to less than 25 percent ; and 25 percent or more . Those in the highest-consuming added sugar group eat about 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day , the study said . Those who consumed more added sugar tended to be younger , non-Latino blacks with low income , it said . The report says 18.5 percent of Americans get at least 25 percent of their calories from added sugar . The strongest relationship between added sugar and blood fats was found in values for HDL-C , which fell from 58.7 mg/dl for those who ate the least added sugar to 47.7 mg/dl for those who ate the most . A higher HDL-C level is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk . Among some blood fats linked to higher cardiovascular risk , the converse was true : Triglyceride levels went from 105 mg/dl in the group that ate the least sugar to 114 mg/dl in the group that ate the most . The so-called bad cholesterol , LDL-C , went from 116 mg/dl for women who ate the least sugar to 123 mg/dl for women who ate the most . There were no significant trends for LDL-C among men . The authors concluded that their data support dietary guidelines that aim to cut consumption of added sugar . But those guidelines are all over the map . The Institute of Medicine recommends no more than 25 percent of total energy from added sugars ; the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent ; and the American Heart Association has recently advised no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men , which works out to about 5 percent . `` What it really means is we have to go back to things like whole grains and vegetables and fruit and eat things in moderation in order to be healthy , '' Vos said . `` Plus , a good healthy dose of activity . '' But the study compiled data based on a single day 's consumption , and it was not clear whether that day was representative of other days , she said . `` We do n't know that all of the people had their usual diet the day before , '' she said . `` There are always some weaknesses in that kind of data . '' Carbohydrates have been linked for decades to abnormal blood fat levels , `` but a big contemporary issue is added sugars , '' said Dr. Frank Sacks , professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston , Massachusetts . Vos ' study `` fills in a gap in the science base . '' The study will likely be discussed next month when the American Heart Association takes up the matter of added sugars at its meeting in Washington , he said . `` We just overeat too damn much , '' he said . `` What this study is saying is that , for some groups -- especially young people , black , poor -- sugar is just way too big a proportion of their intake . '' `` The real truth is that we 're supposed to eat a balanced diet , less processed food , '' said Carla Wolper , a nutritionist at the Obesity Research Center at St. Luke 's Hospital in New York and assistant professor at Columbia University 's Eating Disorders Center . Wolper praised the study for its size and careful construction . But Dr. Richard K. Bernstein , a diabetes specialist based in Mamaroneck , New York , was unimpressed . `` This is just one more study showing that carbohydrates create abnormal lipid profiles , '' he said .",dded-sugar consumption linked t,"obesity , diabetes and tooth decay"
577,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An infant girl delivered prematurely from her mother , who has the swine flu virus , has died , hospital officials said Monday . Aubrey Opdyke was put into a medically induced coma to give the baby as much oxygen as possible . Parker Christine Opdyke was delivered 14 weeks early by doctors at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Florida 's Palm Beach County . Her mother , Aubrey Opdyke , was placed into a medically induced coma June 3 to help give the baby as much oxygen as possible . But doctors delivered Parker on Saturday after her mother suffered a collapsed lung last week . Aubrey Opdyke remains comatose and in critical condition in Wellington 's intensive care unit . `` Despite heroic efforts on the part of physicians and nurses , we are sad to announce that baby Parker Christine Opdyke has expired , '' said a written statement from the hospital . No other details were available Monday . Attempts by CNN to reach the family were unsuccessful . Even under the best circumstances , delivering a child at 27 weeks is a very early birth , Dr. David Feld , a Palm Beach County obstetrician and gynecologist , told CNN affiliate WPEC . `` When you have an infectious case , I do n't think you 're going to see that lung maturity as quickly , and I think that is the issue , '' he said . But , he said , now that Aubrey Opdyke is no longer pregnant , she will be able to fight for her own life . Palm Beach County has had 247 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus , known as swine flu , but only one death . In late June , a 25-year-old pregnant woman died , but her baby survived . Pregnant women have long been a prime concern of health care officials regarding the flu virus , but are of particular concern during this outbreak of swine flu . Pregnant women have always been advised to get a flu shot because they are at greater risk because of the weakened immune system resulting from their pregnancy . But the H1N1 epidemic has seen new complications and challenges . `` We have seen , with this virus , worse complications and severe infections in pregnant women , '' said Dr. Anne Schuchat , director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` We 're urging women who are pregnant who develop fever or respiratory symptoms to seek care promptly . '' The CDC said it is vitally important for pregnant women to recognize the signs and symptoms , like fever and cough , to get to their doctor quickly and to begin taking antiviral medicines early on . `` I know that many pregnant women do n't want to take anything while they 're pregnant , '' said Schuchat . `` This is a situation where you need to be more worried about your health and the baby 's health . '' The CDC also recommends that pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available , in addition to an annual flu shot . `` For people who are at high risk , like pregnant women , planning to receive both vaccines is probably the right way to go , '' Schuchat said . The CDC 's advisory committee will meet later this month to make recommendations on at-risk groups who should receive the new vaccine .",How many week premature was the baby ?,14 weeks

Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock have reason to celebrate after `` The Proposal '' takes top box office spot . Not only did `` The Proposal '' win the weekend , but it was by far the best opening of Bullock 's career , nearly doubling the opening of her previous best , `` Premonition , '' which debuted to $ 17.6 million in 2007 . While `` The Proposal 's '' success was fueled mostly by women -LRB- 73 percent of the audience was female -RRB- , both women and men gave it a healthy `` A - '' CinemaScore rating , so expect the movie to hold up fairly well during the next few weeks . The weekend 's other big release , the prehistoric buddy comedy `` Year One , '' landed in fourth place with $ 20.2 million -- an okay debut for the $ 60 million movie . However , all indicators point to a quick descent for the Jack Black/Michael Cera flick . `` Year One '' dropped 24 percent from Friday to Saturday -LRB- never a reassuring sign -RRB- , and the movie received an unimpressive `` B - '' rating from CinemaScore . `` Year One '' is all but certain to join `` Land of the Lost '' as another box-office disappointment for high-concept comedies .

586,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What recession ? Christie 's , the famed auction house , this week sold a nearly 36-carat diamond for $ 24.3 million , which it said was the highest price for a diamond sold at auction . The 35.56-carat diamond dates back to the 17th century . The previous record was a mere $ 16.5 million for a 100-carat diamond in 1995 , Christie 's said . `` In the midst of these challenging times , we were thrilled to achieve an historic price for an historic diamond , '' said Francois Curiel , chairman of Christie 's Europe and auctioneer for Wednesday 's sale . The 35.56-carat Wittelsbach blue diamond , dating to the 17th century , was purchased by international jeweler Laurence Graff , the auction house said in a release . Graff was bidding against Aleks Paul of Essex Global Trading , a professional of Russian origin based in New York , Christie 's said . `` Known as ` Der Blaue Wittelsbacher ' since 1722 , it is one of very few diamonds which can claim 17th century heritage , incredible rarity and exceptional beauty . '' The diamond , mined in India nearly 400 years ago , has been privately owned since 1964 . Until 1723 , Christie 's said , all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India . The diamond has a royal lineage . Christie 's traces it thus : King Philip IV of Spain -LRB- 1605-1665 -RRB- selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter , the Infanta Margarita Teresa -LRB- 1651-1673 -RRB- . She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria -LRB- 1640-1705 -RRB- , who later became Holy Roman Emperor . When she died in 1673 , her husband retained the diamond , which was passed on to his heirs . In 1722 , the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria -LRB- 1701-1756 -RRB- married the Bavarian Crown Prince , Charles Albert -LRB- 1697-1745 -RRB- . It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III -LRB- 1845-1921 -RRB- in 1918 . The world 's largest deep blue diamond is the `` Hope Diamond , '' a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . Diamonds apparently are recession-proof . Christie 's reported jewelry sales of $ 226 million for the first half of 2008 , calling it `` the best jewelry season ever seen at auction . '' Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007 , Christie 's said . According to Christie 's , key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $ 8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond , which sold for $ 7.1 million on June 11 in London .",How much did the diamond sell for ?,24.3 million

'' The diamond , mined in India nearly 400 years ago , has been privately owned since 1964 . Until 1723 , Christie 's said , all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India . The diamond has a royal lineage . Christie 's traces it thus : King Philip IV of Spain -LRB- 1605-1665 -RRB- selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter , the Infanta Margarita Teresa -LRB- 1651-1673 -RRB- . She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria -LRB- 1640-1705 -RRB- , who later became Holy Roman Emperor . When she died in 1673 , her husband retained the diamond , which was passed on to his heirs . In 1722 , the diamond entered the Wittelsbach family when the Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria -LRB- 1701-1756 -RRB- married the Bavarian Crown Prince , Charles Albert -LRB- 1697-1745 -RRB- . It was worn by successive rulers until the abdication of King Ludwig III -LRB- 1845-1921 -RRB- in 1918 . The world 's largest deep blue diamond is the `` Hope Diamond , '' a 45.52-carat stone housed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . Diamonds apparently are recession-proof . Christie 's reported jewelry sales of $ 226 million for the first half of 2008 , calling it `` the best jewelry season ever seen at auction . '' Sales for the first six months of this year marked a 32 percent increase over the same period in 2007 , Christie 's said . According to Christie 's , key diamonds the company sold in the first half of 2008 included a 13.39-carat fancy intense blue diamond that fetched $ 8.9 million in Geneva on May 14 and the pear-shaped potentially flawless 38-carat Onassis diamond , which sold for $ 7.1 million on June 11 in London .",How long ago have jewels been mined in India ?,400 years
588,"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Although it did n't set a franchise record , `` The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 '' had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $ 139.5 million , according to studio estimates . That 's the fifth-best opening weekend ever , behind `` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 , '' `` The Dark Knight , '' `` Spider-Man 3 , '' and `` The Twilight Saga : New Moon , '' which held on to the franchise record . `` New Moon '' debuted to a slightly better $ 142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago . What 's interesting is how closely `` Breaking Dawn '' followed `` New Moon 's '' trajectory . `` New Moon '' grossed $ 72.7 million its first day , and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday . By comparison , `` Breaking Dawn '' earned $ 72 million on Friday -LRB- the third-best opening day ever -RRB- , and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today . `` New Moon '' ultimately finished its domestic run with $ 296.6 million , and it 's too early to tell whether `` Breaking Dawn '' will wind up a bit short of that final figure . Even if it does , Summit Entertainment wo n't be complaining about grossing nearly $ 300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise . And , of course , the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here . `` Breaking Dawn '' took in $ 144 million from 54 foreign territories this week , pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $ 283.5 million . Summit reports that `` Breaking Dawn '' attracted a crowd that was , unsurprisingly , 80 percent female . What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie 's audience was n't as young as you 'd think , with 60 percent over the age of 21 . According to CinemaScore , 30 percent of the film 's audience was under 18 , but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34 . The popular conception is that The `` Twilight Saga '' is merely a teenage phenomenon , but these figures seem to prove otherwise . The $ 110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B + rating from CinemaScore graders . In second place was Warner Bros. ' 3-D animated sequel `` Happy Feet Two , '' which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $ 22 million . The 2006 original , an Oscar winner for best animated feature , opened to $ 41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges . `` Happy Feet Two '' was saddled with mediocre reviews , which might have discouraged some parents . Furthermore , five years could have been too long of a wait , especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor . The original `` Happy Feet '' was released a year after March of the Penguins , when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist . That moment has clearly passed . The $ 135 million sequel earned a B + rating from CinemaScore moviegoers , and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally . The rest of the top five consisted of holdovers . The 3-D action flick `` Immortals '' dropped a harsh 62 percent for $ 12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both `` 300 '' -LRB- 54 percent -RRB- and `` Clash of the Titans '' -LRB- 57 percent -RRB- . `` Jack and Jill '' witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $ 12 million . And even though `` Happy Feet Two '' underperformed , `` Puss in Boots '' lost much of its family audience . The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $ 10.7 million in its fourth weekend . In limited release , Alexander Payne 's `` The Descendants , '' starring George Clooney , debuted to $ 1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish . The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $ 42,150 per location . Only `` Midnight in Paris , '' `` The Tree of Life , '' and `` Jane Eyre '' opened to stronger per-theater averages this year , and those movies started out on far fewer screens than `` The Descendants . '' 1 . The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 -- $ 139.5 mil 2 . Happy Feet Two -- $ 22.0 mil 3 . Immortals -- $ 12.3 mil 4 . Jack and Jill -- $ 12.0 mil 5 .

589,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nonnie Dotson , a nurse in the U.S. Air Force , was decompressing from a hard-fought child support battle when she disappeared hundreds of miles from her home base . U.S. Air Force nurse Nonnie Dotson disappeared on the way to the mall on November 19 , 2006 . Dotson , 33 , was staying with her brother at his home outside Denver , Colorado , when she vanished on November 19 , 2006 . She was supposed to meet friends at the mall for a smoothie . She never showed . The single mother and her 16-month-old daughter , Savannah , lived in San Antonio , Texas , where Dotson worked on a military base as an intensive care nurse . They were staying with Dotson 's brother , Tony , for a few days . Watch why Dotson 's disappearance puzzles investigators Â '' Dotson had recently emerged from a court battle with Ed Vehle , Savannah 's father . Vehle , who also lived in San Antonio , was ordered by the court to pay $ 10,000 in back child support , as well as $ 900 each month . Dotson won the court order two months before she disappeared . Dotson was just months away from completing her military duty and was trying to decide whether she would move back to her hometown in Colorado or remain in San Antonio . Vehle had declared he had no interest in being a part of their lives . The two met in 2004 and the relationship ended when Dotson became pregnant . Vehle did not want her to have the baby , she told friends at the military base . The friends spoke on condition that their identities would not be made public . Vehle is not a suspect or person of interest in the case , police said . Because things appeared to be going well in Dotson 's life , her sudden disappearance is a mystery to her family and to police . She was hundreds of miles away from home in a safe Denver suburb . She left her brother 's home on Sunday afternoon , and the mall was within walking distance , Tony Dotson said . `` She asked me to look after Savannah for a couple hours and she walked out that door and we never saw her again , '' Tony Dotson added . `` She would never have intentionally left Savannah behind like that . '' Police agree . Since Dotson vanished , there has been no activity on her bank accounts , credit cards or cell phone , police said . Her case is still an open missing persons investigation being handled by the Jefferson County homicide department . `` Unfortunately , we have no real leads as to who is responsible for Dotson 's disappearance , '' said sheriff 's office spokeswoman Jacki Kelley . `` She could be alive and being held against her will . She could have been kidnapped and then murdered . We are not ruling anything out at this time , '' Kelley said . For several weeks after Dotson 's disappearance , Vehle refused to answer questions . He retained counsel . In mid-December 2006 , Vehle and Jay Norton , his attorney , met with police , answering all their questions . Norton said they were able to provide investigators with receipts and cell phone records accounting for Vehle 's whereabouts . Police confirmed that Vehle was nowhere near Colorado before , during or after Dotson 's disappearance . After Dotson 's disappearance , Vehle decided to go to court to pursue full custody of his daughter . Dotson 's parents had been taking care of Savannah . The court last year gave Vehle shared custody with Dotson 's parents . Family and police urge anyone with information about the whereabouts of Nonnie Dotson to call the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Office tip line at -LRB-303-RRB- 271-5612 .

Pakistani soldiers on patrol in the Swat Valley , which is home to the country 's only ski resort . Militants forced their way into the state-run hotel in the northwestern tourist valley early Thursday morning , ransacked it and set it on fire , said Sardar Rehim Shahzad , district coordinator for Swat police . The hotel , the only one at the Malam Jabba ski resort , sustained significant damage , he told CNN . The resort is located near the Afghanistan border and about 300km -LRB- 186 miles -RRB- from the capital city of Islamabad . It was shut down last summer after militants overran the area , keeping tourists away , Shahzad said . Swat Valley , located in North West Frontier Province -LRB- NWFP -RRB- , was once Pakistan 's biggest tourist destination . Aside from the ski resort , it was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area . In recent months , however , militants bent on imposing fundamentalist Islamic law , or Sharia , have unleashed a wave of violence across the NWFP which has claimed hundreds of lives , many of them security personnel . The militants want women to wear veils , beards for men and to ban music and television . After months of bloody battles , the government in May reached a peace deal with fighters loyal to the banned hardline Islamic group , Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi -LRB- TNSM -RRB- . It is the latest attempt by Pakistan 's new government -- headed by the party of the assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto -- to achieve peace through negotiations in the lawless tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein . Ahead of the peace pact , Pakistan 's government released TNSM 's former leader Sufi Mohammed , who had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan . He was freed after agreeing to cooperate with the government . Under the terms of his release , TNSM was also expected to lay down its arms and forgo violence . But his son-in-law Fazlullah , who took over TNSM during his jail stint , vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region .",How far is the resort from Islmabad ?,about 300km -LRB- 186 miles
596,"-LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- -- It was a glass half-full , glass half-empty kind of weekend at the box office for `` Funny People , '' writer-director Judd Apatow 's comedic meditation on fame , humor , life , and death . Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in `` Funny People , '' which took the No. 1 slot at the box office this weekend . According to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office , it opened at the top spot with an estimated $ 23.4 million , better than Apatow 's The 40 Year-Old Virgin -LRB- $ 21.4 million -RRB- -- hence , the glass is half full . But that figure is far lower than the debut for Apatow 's `` Knocked Up '' -LRB- $ 30.7 million -RRB- , and it 's the worst opening for a comedy for star Adam Sander since his 2000 turkey `` Little Nicky '' -- hence , the glass is half empty . Of course , `` Funny People '' was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest , and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler 's serious efforts `` Reign Over Me , '' `` Spanglish , '' and `` Punch-Drunk Love , '' Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again . But whether it 's a comedy , drama , or dramedy , `` Funny People 's '' $ 75 million budget is quite the handful of pretty pennies , and with a shaky `` B - '' Cinemascore , the film is going to have a hard time overcoming tepid word-of-mouth -- and we 're back to the half-empty glass . So let 's just move on , shall we ? The cup of a certain adolescent wizard , meanwhile , definitely runneth over . Thanks to its debut on IMAX -LRB- and the premium ticket prices that come with it -RRB- , `` Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince '' came in second with $ 17.7 million , a soft 40 percent drop from last weekend for $ 255.5 million total . At this rate , the film is well on its way to the upper ranks of the ` Potter ' franchise . The guinea pigs of `` G-Force '' were right on its heels at third place , nibbling up $ 17.1 million , a decent 46 percent drop for a two-week cume of $ 66.5 million . And Katherine Heigl 's romcom `` The Ugly Truth '' took in an additional $ 13 million , a 53 percent drop for fourth place and $ 54.5 million total . Of the two other wide releases this weekend , at least the sci-fi family comedy `` Aliens in the Attic '' -- which grossed a meager $ 7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10 . The torture porn flick `` The Collector '' collected a grisly $ 3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place . Box office on a whole was down a massive 22 percent from last year , when The `` Dark Knight '' and `` The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor '' both took in over $ 40 million , but the specialty market showed some vibrant signs of life . Bone fide indie hit '' -LRB- 500 -RRB- Days of Summer '' expanded to 266 theaters for $ 2.7 million , a $ 10,338 per theater average .

600,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Maryland man believed to have shot and stabbed his wife and three young children to death before killing himself with a shotgun was having money problems and left a note saying he suffered from `` psychological issues , '' authorities said . Five people , including three young children , were found dead in this house in Middletown , Maryland . Christopher Wood , 34 , may have slashed at least some of his family members in the killings and used a small-caliber handgun on others , Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said . He was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun wound at the foot of the bed where the bodies of his wife and 2-year-old daughter lay , the sheriff said . Wood 's sons were 5 and 4 years old , authorities said . His wife , Francie Billotti Wood , was 33 . The boys were found in their beds in a single bedroom , the sheriff said . Authorities did not release the names of the children . `` These are horrific incidents , '' said Jenkins , who said he could n't remember another homicide in the past 20 years in Middletown , a one-stoplight town northwest of Baltimore . `` No one should ever have to be exposed to this . '' Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home . While the notes did n't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings , they did provide some insight into possible problems . `` There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood , '' Jenkins said . There was `` a mention of some medication '' in that note , according to the sheriff . Jenkins said the sheriff 's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Wood 's home . He said investigators also have learned of money problems for Wood , a salesman for CSX Railroad . `` We are aware there were some , maybe , debt problems -- some financial problems , '' Jenkins said . Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies went to the home shortly after 9 a.m. after Mrs. Wood 's father called . Her family had not seen the Woods for about a day and her father forced his way into the locked home , finding the bodies , according to Jenkins . Authorities said a shotgun was found next to Christopher Wood 's body and a .25 - caliber handgun was found in a `` container '' in the kitchen . The sheriff said other weapons that could have been used to stab and cut the victims were found , but he did not say what those weapons were . Watch sheriff 's department 's statement '' Francie Wood 's family were longtime residents of the Middletown area . Her brother had recently retired from a career as a sheriff 's deputy , Jenkins said . The family had moved to town from Florida about four months ago . `` We 're all in shock , '' said the Rev. Kevin Farmer , the family 's minister at Holy Family Catholic Church . `` This was a family , though they had n't been with us very long , they are an integral part of our community . '' Watch views from the crime scene '' He said the road the Woods lived on is a shortcut to the church and he would often see the children while riding a scooter he uses when the weather is good . `` They would always stop and wave and get big eyes as the scooter came by , '' he said . `` They were very happy kids . '' Jenkins said autopsies will be performed on the bodies over the next few days and that it could be weeks before the results are ready to be released . Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home . While the notes did n't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings , they did provide some insight into possible problems , the sheriff said . `` There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood , '' Jenkins said .

601,"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The box office had to contend with the World Series , a very early snowstorm in the Northeast , and Halloween festivities across the country this weekend , but audiences still managed to make it to the movies ! That being said , grosses for new releases `` Puss in Boots , '' `` In Time , '' and `` The Rum Diary , '' were n't all that strong . Check out how they performed below : Dreamworks Animation 's `` Puss in Boots '' was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a $ 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens , and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters . On paper , that number sounds good -- and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a `` Real Steel '' - ish caveat . `` Puss in Boots '' cost $ 130 million to produce , and it earned Dreamworks ' third-worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only `` Flushed Away '' and `` Antz , '' which started with $ 18.8 million and $ 17.2 million , respectively . The 3-D `` Shrek '' - spinoff , cost as much as Dreamworks ' `` Megamind , '' which opened in early November 2010 , but that film began with $ 46 million , and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $ 148.4 million total . `` Puss in Boots '' entered theaters a week earlier , but it will need to endure even better than `` Megamind '' to earn back its budget . The `` A - '' CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible , but considering people are already familiar with the `` Puss in Boots '' character , it 's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers . We wo n't officially know where `` Puss in Boots '' is headed until next weekend , when we see how much the snowstorm , the World Series , and Halloween really affected the box office this frame . -LRB- My guess is not much -- and I 'm not just being catty . -RRB- Second place belonged to `` Paranormal Activity 3 , '' which fell by 65 percent to $ 18.5 million in its second weekend . The found footage horror sequel has scared up $ 81.3 million after ten days in theaters , and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween , `` PA3 '' is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2 's $ 84.8 million cume . Not too shabby for a film that cost Paramount only $ 5 million to make ! Fall Movies : Get the latest news , photos , and more Fox 's $ 40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller `` In Time '' underwhelmed with just $ 12 million in its opening weekend . That debut is less than Timberlake 's last film , `` Friends with Benefits , '' which began with $ 18.6 million on its way to $ 55.8 million , as well as Seyfried 's recent `` Red Riding Hood , '' which debuted with $ 14 million on its way to $ 37.6 million . Ads for `` In Time '' failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time-shifting story , and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away . Timberlake 's leading man status may not have helped matters too much , either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble , like in `` The Social Network '' and `` Bad Teacher . '' Moviegoers issued `` In Time '' an unenthusiastic `` B - '' CinemaScore grade , which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller `` Source Code '' -LRB- $ 14.8 million opening , $ 54.7 million total -RRB- enjoyed earlier this year . In its third weekend , dancing remake `` Footloose '' fell to fourth place , dropping 48 percent to $ 5.4 million . The $ 24 million production has now earned $ 38.5 million after 17 days in theaters , and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough 's first feature film , `` Burlesque '' -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- , sometime this week . Johnny Depp 's latest , `` The Rum Diary , '' stumbled out of the gate with just $ 5 million . `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' this was not . The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp 's other substance abuse picture , 1998â $ ² s `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , '' which debuted to $ 3.3 million and earned $ 10.7 million total . `` The Rum Diary 's '' edgy story was always going to be a tough sell , and FilmDistrict 's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits : `` While we all wish the numbers were better , we 're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson . '' The $ 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict , the young distributor that found success with Insidious -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- earlier this year . The studio has since struggled with both `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark '' -LRB- $ 23.9 million -RRB- and `` Drive '' -LRB- $ 33.7 million so far -RRB- recently . Unfortunately for FilmDistrict , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave `` The Rum Diary '' a harsh `` C '' CinemaScore grade , so it 's not likely to hold well in future weeks . Talk about a bad hangover ... In limited release , Sony 's Shakespeare tale `` Anonymous '' started with $ 1 million out of 256 theaters . That was good enough for a $ 3,774 per theater average , which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks . Young romance `` Like Crazy '' fared better , grossing $ 120,000 out of only 4 theaters , resulting in a $ 30,000 average . Richard Gere 's latest , `` The Double , '' was D.O.A. , pulling in only $ 27,545 out of 11 theaters . It 's not likely to platform much further . Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller `` Margin Call '' continued to play fairly well , grossing $ 713,000 out of 140 theaters . It has earned $ 1.5 million so far . Internationally , `` The Adventures of Tintin '' got off to an excellent start . Sony 's motion capture animation grossed $ 55.8 million out of 19 territories , including $ 21.5 million in France and $ 10.7 million in the United Kingdom , where its being distributed by Paramount .

602,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former New York City police Commissioner Bernard Kerik pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a revised indictment charging him in a corruption and tax evasion case , according to a spokesman for the New York District Attorney . A revised indictment brings to 15 the number of counts against former police Commissioner Bernard Kerik . The revised indictment includes two new counts of aiding the filing of false returns and a charge involving making false statements while applying for a housing loan , spokesman Herbert Hadad of the district attorney 's office told CNN . Kerik is accused of failing to report more than $ 500,000 in income between 1999 and 2004 , said Patricia Haynes , the IRS agent in charge of the case . Prosecutors allege Kerik received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale , New York , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York . Revisions to the original indictment , which included charges of corruption , conspiracy and tax evasion , bring to 15 the number of counts against Kerik . Barry Berke , Kerik 's attorney , declined to comment . The indictment also charges that Kerik made several false statements to the White House and other federal officials when he applied for the position as adviser to the Homeland Security Advisory Council , to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and in connection with his nomination to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson did not rule Monday on whether the two counts that include charges of lying to White House officials will be tried in Washington or White Plains , New York . Kerik is due back in court February 3 for a hearing on pretrial motions , Hadad said . A trial date has not been set . Kerik , 53 , is a longtime friend and former protege of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani . President Bush nominated him to be secretary of homeland security after winning re-election in 2004 , but Kerik withdrew his name amid allegations that he employed a nanny who had a questionable immigration status . Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson began investigating allegations that Kerik had traded payment on repairs to his Bronx apartment for favors , including city contracts . The former chief pleaded guilty in 2006 to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he worked as city corrections commissioner . He was fined $ 221,000 and avoided jail time under his plea agreement . Before tapping Kerik for a Cabinet post , Bush dispatched him to Baghdad to train Iraqi police after the U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein . He left three months into an expected six-month stint , with Iraqi officials telling reporters that he had completed his assignment . In 2004 , he campaigned for Bush 's re-election and spoke at the Republican National Convention in New York .

604,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. government has charged an international arms dealer with conspiring to sell a rebel group millions of dollars in weapons `` to be used to kill Americans in Colombia , '' federal prosecutors announced Tuesday . Viktor Bout is accused of selling missiles , rockets and other weapons to FARC , a Colombian rebel group . Viktor Bout , who was recently captured in Thailand , had agreed to sell the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -LRB- FARC -RRB- surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , `` ultralight '' airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release . There was no immediate public response from Bout , who remains in custody in Thailand . Federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging Bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals , conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . FARC is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department . Justice Department officials said they are seeking Bout 's extradition to the United States . The indictment alleges that Bout made agreements with FARC between November 2007 and March of this year . In their news release , federal prosecutors said Bout agreed to sell weapons `` to two confidential sources '' working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , who had `` represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the FARC , with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack United States helicopters in Colombia . '' The news release also refers to a `` covertly recorded meeting in Thailand on March 6 , 2008 . '' `` With the unsealing of this indictment , we are one step closer to ensuring Bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist , '' DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Loenhart said in the news release . Attorney General Michael Mukasey last month singled out Bout as a leading example of a new breed of organized crime leaders who operate across international boundaries to amass wealth without regard to political ideology . `` Viktor Bout has long been considered by the international community as one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , '' U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in the news release Tuesday . Bout 's assets in the United States were frozen in 2004 after he allegedly shipped weapons to Liberia in violation of U.S. government restrictions .",What did Viktor Bout offer to sell to FARC ?,"selling missiles , rockets and other weapons"
605,"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tropical Storm Arthur , the first named storm of the 2008 Atlantic season , formed Saturday near the coast of Belize , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said . Tropical Storm Arthur could make its way across the Yucatan and re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico . The storm made its way over land and was expected to weaken , but the center said the storm could re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico and regain intensity Sunday . At 11 p.m. , the center of Arthur was over the southern Yucatan Peninsula , about 80 miles -LRB- 125 km -RRB- west of Chetumal , Mexico , and about 120 miles -LRB- 195 km -RRB- south-southeast of Campeche , Mexico . It was moving west at about 7 miles -LRB- 11 km -RRB- per hour . The storm 's maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph -LRB- 65 km/hr -RRB- , with higher gusts , mainly over water east of its center . Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 260 miles -LRB- 415 km -RRB- from the center of the storm , forecasters said . The government of Belize issued a tropical storm warning for the nation 's coast , and the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Catoche south to the border with Belize . A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area -- in this case , within the next six to 12 hours . The storm was forecast to dump up to 10 inches of rain over Belize , up to 15 inches in isolated areas , the hurricane center said . The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season begins Sunday . On Thursday , Tropical Storm Alma , the first one of the year in the eastern Pacific , formed near the west coast of Central America , according to the National Weather Service . The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over the high terrain of Central America . The federal government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted this month that the Atlantic season would be more active than normal , with up to 16 named storms and up to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or above . The noted Colorado State University hurricane forecasting team predicted this year that there would be 15 named storms , eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes . The team calculated a 69 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. coast . A survey released this week found that 50 percent of 1,100 adults surveyed in Atlantic and U.S. Gulf Coast states did not have disaster plans or survival kits . `` Nearly one in three said they would not prepare their home until a storm is within 24 hours of landfall , '' Bill Read , director of the National Hurricane Center , said Thursday . `` Now is the time to buy all that stuff , '' he said upon the release of the survey by polling firm Mason-Dixon .",If the storm re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico could it regain intensity ?,the center said the storm could re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico and regain intensity Sunday
608,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an Alabama teenager in Aruba in 2005 , based on new evidence in the case , prosecutors announced Wednesday . Natalee Holloway disappeared while on an Aruba vacation in 2005 . Brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were arrested in Aruba at the same time authorities in the Netherlands picked up Joran Van der Sloot at the request of the Aruban government , the statement said . Van der Sloot is attending school in Holland . The three had previously been arrested in 2005 , Aruban prosecutors noted in a statement , but a court released them , citing insufficient evidence . They are now charged with `` involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of Natalee Holloway or causing serious bodily harm to Natalee Holloway , resulting in her death , '' the statement said . Watch interview with Holloway 's father '' Van der Sloot , now 20 , and the Kalpoes , now ages 24 and 21 , were the last people seen with Holloway , 18 , as she left Carlos n ' Charlie 's nightclub in Oranjestad , Aruba , about 1:30 a.m. on May 30 , 2005 . All three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance . View a timeline of the case '' No information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests . Aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the Netherlands has been reviewing the Holloway case at the request of authorities in Aruba , and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation . The Kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by Aruban police Wednesday , Aruba prosecutor Dop Kruimel told CNN . They will appear before a judge Friday for a preliminary arrest hearing , in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible , she said . The judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days , meaning police have that much time to produce evidence . The suspects then go before a judge again , she said . Van der Sloot was arrested in Arnhem , the Netherlands , by Dutch police , Kruimel said . Aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to Aruba within eight days . Because they were not familiar with the case , Dutch police were not questioning Van der Sloot , she said . He will be questioned when he is brought back to Aruba , she said . However , he will appear before a judge Thursday in Arnhem . When CNN called the Kalpoe household , the person who answered the phone hung up . Earlier , Van der Sloot 's mother , Anita Van der Sloot , told CNN her son had not been arrested , but had only reported to a police station in the Netherlands for questioning Wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so . Anita Van der Sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in Aruba . She said a Dutch attorney was with him , and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released Thursday . Meanwhile , a spokeswoman for Holloway 's mother , Beth Holloway , said in a statement , `` The family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case . '' Beth Holloway was refusing interviews for now , said spokeswoman Sunny Tillman . She previously was known as Beth Holloway-Twitty , but has returned to using Holloway after a divorce earlier this year . Natalee Holloway was visiting Aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama , when she went to Carlos n ' Charlie 's that night in 2005 . The group had planned to leave for home the following day , and Holloway 's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight . Her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the United States , Aruba , the Netherlands and beyond , but Holloway has never been found . Aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case . At least 10 men , including Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes , have been arrested and identified as suspects either in Holloway 's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up . All were questioned and released . Legal experts , however , have said differences in the U.S. and Aruban systems should be taken into account . Aruba 's criminal justice system is based on Dutch law and a descendant of the Napoleonic code . In Aruba , authorities ' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest , while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect 's guilt or innocence . There are no jury trials . Aruban authorities , meanwhile , have suggested that Holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning . Beth Holloway and Natalee Holloway 's father , Dave Holloway , filed a lawsuit last year against Van der Sloot and his father , Aruban judge Paulus Van der Sloot , in the Supreme Court of the State of New York . The Van der Sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to New York . However , a judge in August 2006 dismissed the suit , saying New York was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it . It was unclear whether Holloway 's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere .

611,"-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- `` Real Steel '' showed what it was made of , as the robot-boxing action drama won the weekend with an estimated $ 27.3 million . That 's the strongest opening ever for a boxing-themed picture , beating `` Rocky IV '' 's $ 20 million debut in 1985 -LRB- when not adjusting for inflation -RRB- . DreamWorks ' $ 110 million film , which was released by Disney 's Touchstone Pictures , scored a superb `` A '' rating from CinemaScore graders . That bodes well for the movie 's box-office stamina , especially since there are no other major family films hitting theaters until `` Puss in Boots '' pounces on October 28 . Unsurprisingly for a movie about mechanical fighters beating up one another , `` Real Steel '' skewed male -- 66 percent of the audience according to Disney . It also attracted a younger crowd , with 44 percent under the age of 25 . The PG-13 movie 's respectable opening must also come as a relief to star Hugh Jackman , who has n't had a non-X-Men film open to more than $ 20 million since 2004â $ ² s `` Van Helsing . '' In second with $ 10.4 million was the political thriller `` The Ides of March . '' The R-rated film -- which George Clooney directed , co-wrote , and co-stars in along with Ryan Gosling , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Paul Giamatti , Evan Rachel Wood , and Marisa Tomei -- particularly appealed to older women . According to Sony , 58 percent of the audience was female and 60 percent was over the age of 35 . The $ 12.5 million movie earned a `` B '' grade from CinemaScore participants , which is a bit lower than expected considering its awards buzz and positive reviews . `` The Ides of March '' will need to hold up well the next few weeks if it wants to keep its Oscar hopes alive .

614,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination , the CDC said late Monday . The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville , New York , was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli , a potentially deadly species of bacteria . The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe 's , Price Chopper , Lancaster and Wild Harvest , Shaw 's , BJ 's , Ford Brothers , and Giant Food Stores . The exact products affected are listed on the USDA 's Web site . The recall was for distribution centers in eight states , but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states . Each package is printed with `` EST. 492 '' inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label . They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28 , the USDA said . Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall , the USDA said . E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and in the most severe cases , kidney failure . The very young , seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness . The USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products , whether they are fresh or frozen , and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit . The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature , the FSIS said . Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak , eight are in Massachusetts ; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire ; two each are in Maine , Pennsylvania and South Dakota ; and one each is in California , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Vermont , according to the CDC .",What should you use to measure the temperature of beef ?,food thermometer
617,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton . Almost 30 years later , Etan Patz is still missing . Etan Patz , 6 , disappeared while walking to a school bus stop . It was the first time he 'd gone alone . Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25 , 1979 , the Friday before Memorial Day . He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York . It was the first time he 'd walked to the bus stop by himself . It was just a few blocks away . Etan , like any 6-year-old , argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone , and his parents relented . His mother , Julie Patz , learned that Etan had n't been in classes when he failed to return home . She called the school at 3:30 p.m. , then called the homes of all his friends . When no one had seen Etan , she called police and filed a missing person 's report . By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds . The search continued for weeks , but no clues to Etan 's whereabouts were found . Watch an update on the case '' The boy 's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children 's movement , which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children . Etan 's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s . `` In our minds there were only two possibilities , '' said Stan Patz , the boy 's father . `` Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own , and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe . '' Patz lived with this hope until 1982 , when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos ' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan 's . Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City , a neighborhood not far from Soho . In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge , where he lived , said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois , who spent years investigating the case . When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home , they found he had many photographs of small blond boys . They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz , according to author Lisa R Cohen 's book about the case , `` After Etan : The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive . '' Bronx police questioned Ramos , and he denied having anything to do with Etan 's disappearance . But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy , GraBois said . Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead , but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan 's disappearance , GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office said . Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him , according to published reports . He left town and disappeared for six years -- until GraBois reviewed Etan 's case . GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect . GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison . GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question : `` How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz ? '' Ramos told GraBois that he 'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing . `` He was 90 percent sure it was the same he 'd seen in the news that was missing , '' GraBois said . According to GraBois , Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights . `` Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights , '' GraBois said . When questioned further , Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer , according to GraBois . Ramos is serving a 10 - to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania . He is scheduled to be released in November 2012 , GraBois said . GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison , and planted informants as his cell mates . He would n't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them , but said he 's convinced he 's eyeing the right suspect . GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , but prosecutors have not brought charges . They say that without a body , they do n't have enough evidence . Etan 's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case . Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline : 212-384-2200 .",When did Etan Patz disappear ?,"May 25 , 1979"
618,"Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in last week 's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood urged in 2007 that Muslims in the U.S. Army be allowed to claim conscientious objector status when it comes to fighting other Muslims in war , a defense official said Tuesday . Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan also discussed religious aspects of Islam during a presentation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as part of a final project for his residency tenure , said the official , who has knowledge of the investigation into Hasan . `` It 's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims , '' Hasan said , according to a slide show that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . `` Muslims -LSB- sic -RSB- soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting/killing believers unjustly , '' a Hasan slide said , though he added that individual feelings `` will vary ! '' Hasan is the only suspect in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on Thursday that left 13 people dead and 42 wounded . Twelve of the dead were soldiers . Hasan remains in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas , after having been shot by a police officer . Dr. Val Finnell , a former medical school classmate of Hasan 's , described him as `` a very outspoken opponent of the war '' in the classroom and in public settings . `` He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam , '' Finnell said . He added that he was shocked by Thursday 's shooting . `` However , that said , given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people , I am not surprised . '' Hasan 's comments came in what was supposed to be a medical seminar , The Washington Post reported , but instead he spoke to senior Army doctors about Islam . Hasan , a psychiatrist , aimed to describe `` religious conflicts that Muslims may have with the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' according to the newspaper 's report . The report is based on a slideshow that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . See the presentation and the Post 's report In a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation `` indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . '' Hasan came under investigation for a time last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric 's communications , a federal law enforcement official said . An employee of the Defense Department 's Criminal Investigative Services , assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force , ultimately made the decision to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan 's personnel files . However , a senior defense department official said late Tuesday that the agency was not aware of any such communication . `` Contrary to reports we have seen in some news outlets , based on what we know now , neither the United States Army nor any other organization within the Department of Defense knew of Major Hasan 's contacts with any Muslim extremists , '' the official said . `` Not until after the tragic shooting at Fort Hood last week were Major Hasan 's e-mail communications first brought to our attention by federal investigators . '' President Obama traveled to Fort Hood for a memorial service on Tuesday for the victims of the shooting . Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other dignitaries also attended the service . Read profiles of the shooting victims Hasan , 39 , was wounded several times during the attack . His ventilator was removed over the weekend , and he began talking afterward , hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said . Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday , but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney , according to senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation . Hasan has retained a lawyer , ex-military judge and retired Army Col. John Galligan , the attorney told CNN affiliate KXXV-TV . `` Like anybody that 's facing criminal charges in the military arena , he 's entitled to a defense counsel , '' Galligan told the station . Galligan said he had a 25-minute conversation with Hasan , and the two did not talk much about the Fort Hood shooting . `` There 's still a lot to be done on the medical side , '' Galligan said . Hasan , a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997 . He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military . Hasan , a Muslim , also told his family that he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 . In August , he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read `` Allah is Love '' was torn off .

Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb . Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws . Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said . Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals . Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes . Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration . Lawson and Ogren had neither . `` These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , '' said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent . `` This particular animal tested negative , '' he said . Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , `` but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . '' Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States . The journal also described the pair 's `` acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , '' McDevitt 's office said . Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant . `` The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , '' the statement from McDevitt 's office said . Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife . He will be sentenced in January . Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 . The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release .

Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 . The woman 's declaration seeking dismissal was filed Monday in Los Angeles , California , in connection with Polanski 's efforts to have the 31-year-old case dismissed . Polanski , 75 , has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse . Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl , and an arrest warrant against him remains in effect . In her declaration , Samantha Geimer said , `` I am no longer a 13-year-old child . I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception . `` Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others . That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . '' Geimer , who has spoken publicly about the case before , including a 2003 appearance on CNN 's `` Larry King Live , '' added , `` I have survived , indeed prevailed , against whatever harm Mr. Polanski may have caused me as a child . '' She chided the district attorney 's office for not dismissing the case earlier and for `` yet once again -LRB- giving -RRB- great publicity to the lurid details of those events , for all to read again . True as they may be , the continued publication of those details cause harm to me ... I have become a victim of the actions of the District Attorney . '' The Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office had no immediate response to Geimer 's declaration . Lawyers for the Oscar-winning film director filed a motion for dismissal of the sex offense case against him in December , citing what the defense called `` extraordinary new evidence '' of `` repeated , unlawful and unethical misconduct '' by the Los Angeles district attorney 's office and the judge in Polanski 's case . The December motion also argued that Polanski should not be required to return to the United States to appear in court for the dismissal motion to be considered . In her declaration , Geimer said if Polanski can not appear in court , she will do so to seek dismissal . `` My position is absolutely clear , '' she said . Polanski 's motion for dismissal is scheduled for a hearing on January 21 . Polanski , a native of Poland , won the Academy Award in 2003 for his Holocaust drama , `` The Pianist .

Chris Brown attends his arraignment in Los Angeles on Thursday . Attorney Mark Geragos is at right . The judge granted Rihanna 's request . Brown , 19 , allegedly attacked Rihanna , 21 , during an argument in February that began when she found a text message from another woman on his cell phone , according to a sworn police statement .

Rihanna was not in the courtroom . Referring to the `` no contact '' order that could have been imposed , Etra told reporters after the hearing , `` Rihanna requested that no such order be issued . '' Etra said the less stringent protective order against harassment and threats signed by Lousteau was `` more than sufficient in this case . '' Etra did not respond when reporters asked if the singer was cooperating with prosecutors in the case against Brown . Brown , dressed in a suit and tie , said little during the hearing , except to answer `` yes '' when the judge asked him if he wished to waive his right to a speedy trial in exchange for a delay in arraignment . He then signed a waiver , which also allows Geragos to appear without him in court for hearings on routine issues . Lousteau ordered Brown to return to court on April 6 for formal arraignment .

623,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The second-highest ranking official in Iraqi President Jalal Talabani 's political party resigned Saturday , along with four other high-ranking Kurdish politicians , officials said . Iraqi President Jalal Talabani could be jeopardized by the resignations of five key members of his party . Khosrat Rasul , the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government , resigned , along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , according to Kurdish lawmakers . Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan , a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq . It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . `` It looks very serious , '' said Ala Talabani , the president 's niece and a PUK member , as well as a member of Parliament . She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya , long a stronghold of the PUK . `` It 's about corruption , '' Ala Talabani said of the resignations . `` They are asking about the resources and the money . Who is spending it . And who is in charge of the income of the party . '' `` It 's not good , '' said Mahmoud Othman , a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician . `` The PUK is one of the main two -LSB- Kurdish -RSB- players , '' he added . `` A problem like this will upset the whole situation . '' Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad 's control after the 1991 Gulf War . Since then , the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions , Talabani 's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party , led by Massoud Barzani . For several years throughout the 1990s , the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq . Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States ' overthrow of Hussein . For the past five years , the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region 's position in Iraq . Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions . They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan 's militia of pesh merga fighters . Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians . The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani , the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history . `` If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow , this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics , '' said Hiwa Osman , the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting . Iraq 's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May . Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms . This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers . Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power .",What could resignations threaten ?,the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan
624,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma , heiress and socialite Martha `` Sunny '' von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home , according to a family statement . She was 76 . Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg . Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s . Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma . He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal . He was acquitted in a second trial . His retrial in 1985 received national attention . `` We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , '' said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie `` Ala '' Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman . `` She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members . '' Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family . She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $ 75 million , according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com 's Crime Library Web site . In her early years , she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly . She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage , to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria . That marriage produced two children : Alexander and Annie Laurie . The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter , Cosima . On the morning of December 22 , 1980 , family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family 's posh Newport , Rhode Island , home . She never regained consciousness . She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered , according to the Crime Library site . Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar . Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin . The case also led to a major motion picture , `` Reversal of Fortune . '' Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow . Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz , who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction , said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow 's death is `` a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime . We proved overwhelming -LSB- ly -RSB- that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced . We saved his life , but could not save hers . '' Claus von Bulow 's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow 's alcohol use , among other factors , caused her coma . Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England . Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said . The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren . Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham , who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow , filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal . The case was settled out of court in 1987 , according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island . Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife 's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped . The von Bulows ' daughter , Cosima , sided with her father . Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne , who covered the von Bulow case , told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998 . Watch Dunne recall case Â '' Ala von Auersperg Isham served for a time as president of the Sunny von Bulow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation , according to the Providence Journal . An offshoot of that organization , the Brain Trauma Foundation , still operates in New York , the newspaper said .

Morgan Library in New York and the Preservation Society of Newport , Rhode Island . A private memorial service will be held for family and friends in New York in the coming days , the family statement said Saturday , along with a private burial .

625,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 1 Serena Williams ' preparations for her Australian Open title defense suffered a late blip when she was beaten in the final of the Sydney International by Elena Dementieva on Friday . The American , who had struggled past unseeded Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai in three sets in the semifinals when she appeared to injure her left leg , lost 6-3 6-2 to suffer her fifth defeat in her last eight clashes with the Russian . `` I was struggling a little bit , but she definitely deserves all the credit , '' Williams told reporters . `` It 's definitely not ligament problems . It 's just a little pain but the strapping usually helps the pain go away . '' Dementieva , who beat world No. 2 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals , successfully defended her title in the final event before the first Grand Slam tournament of this decade starts on Monday . `` It 's great to play against the best players in the world , especially going into a Grand Slam . It was a great experience and it 'll help me next week at the Australian Open , '' she told the WTA Tour 's official Web site Dementieva went into the match against Williams having been handed a potential second-round clash with former world No. 1 Justine Henin , who pulled out of the Sydney event as a precaution after suffering a leg injury in her comeback tournament in Brisbane . Seven-time Grand Slam winner Henin , handed a wildcard after a 20-month retirement , will start against unseeded fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens on Monday while fifth seed Dementieva plays fellow Russian Vera Dushevina . Both have avoided the Williams sisters , who are in the top half of the draw with Serena opening against Poland 's Urszula Radwanska on Tuesday and sixth seed Venus taking on Czech Lucie Safarova . Four-time winner Serena could face seventh seed Victoria Azarenka in the last eight , with a possible semifinal against her older sibling looming . Last year 's losing finalist Safina opens against world No. 44 Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia , and could face fellow Russian Maria Sharapova in the fourth round . Sharapova , the 2008 champion but seeded 14th after struggling with shoulder problems last year , begins with a glamour clash against compatriot and fellow pin-up girl Maria Kirilenko . U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters could face fellow comeback queen Henin in the quarterfinals , having been seeded 15th and facing a qualifier first up . But to set up a rematch of the recent final in Brisbane , which she won , Clijsters is likely to have to overcome third seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round . The Russian , who has never got past the last eight in Melbourne , takes on unseeded compatriot Anastasia Rodionova in her first match .

626,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama said Wednesday night he will work with Congress and the military to repeal the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy that bars gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces . Obama made the remark in his first State of the Union speech during a short litany of civil rights issues , which included his successful hate crimes bill , a move to `` crack down on equal-pay laws '' and improvement of the immigration system . `` We find unity in our incredible diversity , drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution : the notion that we are all created equal , that no matter who you are or what you look like , if you abide by the law you should be protected by it , '' he said . `` We must continually renew this promise . My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination . We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate , '' he said . `` This year , I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are . '' Weigh in on the president 's address Former Navy pilot Sen. John McCain said `` it would be a mistake '' to repeal the 1993 law that bars gay men and lesbians from revealing their sexual orientation , and prevents the military from asking about it . `` This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years , and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels , '' McCain said . `` We have the best-trained , best-equipped , and most professional force in the history of our country , and the men and women in uniform are performing heroically in two wars . At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield , now is not the time to abandon the policy . '' But in a message to Pentagon leadership , Gen. John Shalikashvili , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said it 's time to repeal the law . `` As a nation built on the principal of equality , we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military , '' said Shalikashvili . His letter was sent to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D-New York , who supports repealing the policy . The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , an organization that works with those affected by the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' law , praised Obama 's call for repeal . `` We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010 , '' the group said . `` We call on the president to repeal the archaic 1993 law in his defense budget currently being drafted , that is probably the only and best moving bill where DADT can be killed this year . ... The American public , including conservatives , is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one . '' House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , flatly disagreed with the idea of ending it . `` When it comes to ` do n't ask do n't tell , ' frankly , I think it 's worked very well . And we just ought to leave it alone , '' he said to reporters Wednesday morning . The policy prohibits openly gay men and women from serving in the U.S. armed forces . The policy bans military recruiters or authorities from asking about an individual 's sexual orientation but also prohibits a service member from revealing that he or she is gay . Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin , D-Michigan , supports ending the practice but wants to go about it carefully . Levin said he did not have any details about what the president would say . `` If we do this in a way which is n't sensitive ... we could have exactly the opposite effect of what I hope will be the case -- which is to change the policy , '' he said Monday . Levin said the committee plans to hold hearings on the issue in early February , although the hearing may be with outside experts -- delaying a hearing with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen , that had originally been promised , CNN was told by a congressional source . Obama campaigned on the promise that he would repeal the law in his first year of office . Speaking to the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign , in October , Obama admitted that `` our progress may be taking longer than we like , '' but he insisted his administration was still on track to overturn the policy . `` Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach , '' he said . Pentagon Spokesman Geoff Morrell deflected repeated questions about the policy at Wednesday 's Pentagon briefing , directing reporters to take their questions to the White House . `` We continue to work on this problem , '' said Morrell . `` But I 'm not going to get into it with more specificity than that .

627,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination , the CDC said late Monday . The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville , New York , was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli , a potentially deadly species of bacteria . The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe 's , Price Chopper , Lancaster and Wild Harvest , Shaw 's , BJ 's , Ford Brothers , and Giant Food Stores . The exact products affected are listed on the USDA 's Web site . The recall was for distribution centers in eight states , but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states . Each package is printed with `` EST. 492 '' inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label . They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28 , the USDA said . Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall , the USDA said . E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and in the most severe cases , kidney failure . The very young , seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness . The USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products , whether they are fresh or frozen , and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit . The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature , the FSIS said . Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak , eight are in Massachusetts ; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire ; two each are in Maine , Pennsylvania and South Dakota ; and one each is in California , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Vermont , according to the CDC .",What is E.coli ?,a potentially deadly species of bacteria
628,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday addressed issues ranging from the sex abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church to the easy availability of pornography to the `` alarming decrease '' in Catholic marriages in the United States . The pope arrives to address U.S. bishops in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception . He spoke at a prayer service with U.S. bishops at Washington 's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception , the largest Roman Catholic church in North America . Benedict said the sexual abuse of children by priests has caused a `` deep shame '' and called it `` gravely immoral behavior . '' `` Many of you have spoken to me of the enormous pain that your communities have suffered when clerics have betrayed ... their obligations , '' he told the bishops . Responding to the situation has not been easy and was sometimes very badly handled , the pope admitted . Watch the pope address the issue '' `` It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm , '' he said . The pope then turned his attention to a different concern involving kids . `` What does it mean to speak of child protection when pornography and violence can be viewed in so many homes through media widely available today ? '' he asked . Benedict urged the media and entertainment industry to take part in a `` moral renewal . '' Earlier Wednesday , President Bush , first lady Laura Bush and more than 13,500 spectators welcomed Benedict in an elaborate ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House . In remarks greeting the pope to the White House , Bush called the United States `` a nation of prayer . '' Bush was interrupted by applause as he said , `` In a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded , we need your message that all human life is sacred and that each of us is willed . '' Benedict responded by praising the role of religion in the United States . `` From the dawn of the republic , America 's quest for freedom has been guided by the conviction that the principles governing political and social life are intimately linked to a moral order based on the dominion of God the creator , '' he said . Watch Benedict talk about his hopes for the trip '' Earlier , a U.S. Marine Corps band performed the national anthem of the Holy See as well as `` The Star-Spangled Banner . '' A fife and drum corps in Colonial costumes also played tunes , including `` Yankee Doodle , '' and soprano Kathleen Battle sang `` The Lord 's Prayer . '' The day , with perfect spring weather , was also the pontiff 's 81st birthday . After the ceremony concluded , the crowd , led by Battle , serenaded Benedict with `` Happy Birthday '' as he smiled from a White House balcony . Watch a priest who has known Benedict for years tell what he 's like '' Guests on the South Lawn included Catholic clergy , ecumenical representatives , Catholic schoolchildren , Boy Scouts , Girl Scouts , Sisters of the Poor and Knights of Columbus . Event planners faced an enormous demand for tickets for what White House press secretary Dana Perino called `` one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House . '' Following the ceremony , Bush and the pope had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office . The pope left the White House at about noon in his distinctive `` popemobile . '' His massive motorcade moved slowly down the wide avenues of the U.S. capital to the Vatican Embassy , where the pope is staying . Crowds of enthusiastic spectators waved U.S. and Vatican flags and screamed as the pontiff rode past . A smiling Benedict arrived Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to cheers from a crowd of invited guests . The pontiff was greeted by Bush , the first lady and their daughter Jenna , each of whom shook his hand . It was believed to be the first time an American president has greeted a world dignitary on arrival at Andrews . It marks Benedict 's first visit to the United States as pope . Watch how the pope 's visit could affect the presidential campaign '' Security will be tight during the six-day visit , with 27 state , local and federal agencies protecting the pope as he meets with religious leaders , celebrates Mass at two baseball stadiums and makes his way around in the popemobile . Benedict faces no specific threats , according to the FBI , but a March audio message from Osama bin Laden mentioned the pontiff . The centerpiece of the trip 's Washington leg will be Thursday 's Mass at Nationals Park , a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to see the pope . Everyone must go through metal detectors on entering , and nearby roads and bridges will be closed . Temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium , and a 1 1/2 - mile section of the adjacent Anacostia River will be closed during the Mass. . Benedict will travel to New York on Friday and address the U.N. General Assembly , linking the visit to the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . He 'll celebrate Mass on Sunday morning at Yankee Stadium . Where will the pope be ? '' One of the stated goals of the pope 's visit is to energize the U.S. Catholic community with its estimated 70 million members . Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II , Benedict is likely to also address the church 's relationship with other faiths , the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election , said John Allen , a CNN Vatican analyst .

633,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Gulf of Mexico undersea gusher is the largest oil spill in United States history -- possibly already more than twice as big as the Exxon Valdez spill , government estimates suggested Thursday . Scientists observed 130,000 to 270,000 barrels of oil on the water 's surface on May 17 , and think a similar amount had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated . That would mean 260,000 to 540,000 barrels had leaked as of 10 days ago . The Exxon Valdez leaked about 250,000 barrels into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . The busted well is spewing oil at a rate of at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day , U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt told reporters Thursday . A barrel of oil has 42 gallons , so that 's 504,000 to 798,000 gallons a day . That 's more than twice as much as previous estimates , which put the rate at 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day . It 's also the more conservative estimate of two reached by two separate teams of government scientists who used two different methods , McNutt told reporters Thursday . One team looked at the oil on the surface and came up with the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day . A second team used a different method and came up with a range of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels per day , McNutt said . The official estimate uses the range where the estimates overlap . The lower end of the government estimate -- 12,000 barrels per day -- would mean that about 18.6 million gallons of oil has been spilled since the April 20 oil rig explosion that started the leak . The higher end -- 19,000 barrels per day -- would mean 29.5 million gallons has been spilled . The Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil . Worldwide , there have been more than a dozen bigger oil spills than the Gulf spill . The worst was the destruction of Kuwaiti terminals and tankers by Saddam Hussein 's forces during the 1991 Gulf war , which spilled 240 million gallons , according to the Oil Spill Intelligence Report . The amount of oil spilled could have very specific financial ramifications for BP . If the government finds the company negligent or the leak avoidable , BP will owe royalties on the lost oil , Minerals Management Service spokesman Nicholas Pardi told CNN . `` Now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the Gulf , '' said Jeremy Symons , senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation . `` BP has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions . It 's as if two Exxon Valdez tankers have already run aground , and more are on the way if they do n't get this hole plugged . `` This independent government estimate shows what we expected all along -- BP can not be trusted , because every gallon of oil that is spilled means they will pay more in fines and liability , '' Symons said . The estimates are preliminary and based on new methodologies , McNutt said in a teleconference . The first team , which got the lower estimate , analyzed how much oil was on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on a given date , using aerial imaging . They estimated that `` 130,000 to 270,000 barrels -LRB- were -RRB- on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on May 17 , '' McNutt said . `` We estimate that , in addition , as of May 17 a similar volume of oil had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated , '' she said . That led those scientists to the range of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day . The second group used video observations to arrive at the higher figure . The scientific teams were composed of federal scientists , independent experts and representatives from universities around the country , McNutt said . BP , which owns the well , was not involved except to provide raw data , she said . CNN 's Richard Allen Greene , David Mattingly and Courtney Yager , and CNN Radio 's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report .",What could have ramifications ?,The amount of oil spilled
634,"Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of actress Lindsay Lohan was arrested in connection with a domestic dispute , authorities said Tuesday . Michael Lohan , 50 , was arrested late Monday , the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department 's West Hollywood Station said in a statement . Deputies arrested him on suspicion of inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant , false imprisonment and preventing the report of victimization , the statement said . All are felony charges . Bail was set at $ 200,000 , the statement said , but authorities said Tuesday afternoon Lohan had not been booked . He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after he complained of `` a medical condition not related to the incident '' following his arrest . He will remain at the hospital on observation for at least 24 hours before he is booked at the West Hollywood Station , police said . The sheriff 's department did not identify the alleged victim . But Kate Major , Lohan 's former fiancee , told CNN she was the victim . `` I can confirm but barely type , '' Major wrote in an e-mail . `` No other comment . '' The alleged victim suffered minor injuries but refused medical treatment , the sheriff 's department said . Lohan was arrested near West Hollywood Station following the incident when deputies saw him walking on Santa Monica Boulevard , the statement said . The relationship between Michael Lohan and his 24-year-old daughter has been publicly strained for years , although the two did undergo family counseling together during her recent treatment at the Betty Ford Center . Lindsay Lohan must decide by Wednesday if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial on a felony grand theft charge . She is accused of walking out without paying for a $ 2,500 necklace from Kamofie and Co. , a jewelry store in Venice , California , on January 22 . If Lindsay Lohan decides to go to trial , a preliminary hearing will be held April 22 . The judge at that time would also consider the matter of her probation violation ; she faces possible jail time for violating her probation for a drunk-driving arrest because of the theft charge .

635,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former `` Manson family '' member who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and is now terminally ill faces her 13th parole hearing on Wednesday . Susan Atkins , shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders , has a parole hearing Wednesday . Susan Atkins , 61 , has terminal brain cancer . As of earlier this year , she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair , according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse . However , despite her declining health and an impressive prison record , Whitehouse wrote , `` there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society . '' The hearing will be held at the Central California Women 's Facility at Chowchilla , California , said Terry Thornton , spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness . Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders '' `` Last we heard , she is expected to attend , '' Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins . The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room , but depending on Atkins ' condition , it could be held at her bedside , Thornton said . The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors , she said . Atkins -- California 's longest-serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously , Thornton said . She was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969 . She and the others -- Manson , Leslie Van Houten , Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles `` Tex '' Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people , including Tate , and two additional deaths the following night . Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation 's death penalty laws in 1972 . By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , and stabbed the actress , who was eight months pregnant , 16 times . In a 1993 parole board hearing , Atkins said Tate `` asked me to let her baby live . ... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . '' After killing Tate , according to historical accounts of the murders , Atkins scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband , director Roman Polanski . Polanski was not home at the time , but three of Tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his nearby cottage . If the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a `` tentative suitability finding '' -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings , Thornton said . If it still stands , the matter then goes to the governor 's office . The governor 's options include allowing the decision to stand , actively approving it , modifying it or reversing it , according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 's Web site . However , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins ' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death . The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008 . It was also opposed by Debra Tate , Sharon Tate 's sister . If parole is not granted , another hearing will be set in three , five , seven , 10 or 15 years , at the discretion of the panel , Thornton said . Atkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson . But Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free , saying the slayings were `` so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back . '' `` The ` Manson Family ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , '' Debra Tate said . `` They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die . There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the ` Manson Family . ' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do . '' In a manuscript posted on her Web site , Atkins , who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz , wrote that `` this is the past I have to live with , and I have to live with it every day . '' `` Unlike the reader , or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool , I ca n't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life . Just like the families and friends of the victims , this is with me every day . I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away . And that 's not ` neat , ' and that 's not ` cool . ' '' Atkins ' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008 , Whitehouse wrote on his Web site . On May 15 , doctors predicted she would live less than six months . But she passed that deadline , he wrote , and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7 .",Who has admitted stabbing actress Sharon Tate to Death .,Susan Atkins
637,"Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai made an unannounced visit to Marjah on Sunday to see the gains made after a massive military offensive by Afghan and international troops to wrest control of the southern city from the Taliban . Karzai toured the city in Helmand province with Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan . Marjah residents remain skeptical of U.S. troops and the newly installed local government that has moved in and taken over , said U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson , who was in charge of the Marjah offensive . They want to know what Karzai 's government is going to be able to do for them , he said . `` We are in competition every day for the confidence and support of the population -- we 're in competition with the Taliban , '' Nicholson told reporters last week . `` We have a very narrow window of opportunity here in Marjah to make that first impression and you get one shot at it , '' he said . Dubbed Operation Moshtarak , the offensive was launched last month by an international coalition of 15,000 troops including Afghans , Americans , Britons , Canadians , Danes , and Estonians . The Marjah region has long been a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and is where the Taliban had set up a shadow government . It is a key area in Afghanistan 's heroin trade and full of the opium used to fund the insurgency . The hope now is for the United States to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the Taliban 's drug trade -- and instead grow crops like wheat , which can help them survive and provide income as well . Nicholson said for years , the Taliban-run town had no police force . Now , the Afghan government is in the process of recruiting Marjah citizens to join a new police force that would be trained by the Marines . The general had no timetable on how long it would take to truly secure the town . Meanwhile , in Baghlan province , about 50 insurgents , including more than a dozen Taliban , were killed in fighting between two rebel groups , the province 's governor said Sunday . Some 35 fighters of the Hezb-e-Eslami , or Islamic Party , and 13 Taliban died in the fighting , which began Saturday and continued into Sunday , Mohammed Akbar Barikzai told CNN . Apparently some bystanders also were killed or wounded , Barikzai said , adding he could not put an exact number on the civilian casualties . More Afghanistan coverage on Afghanistan Crossroads blog Hezb-e-Eslami is an insurgent group loyal to warlord Gulbeddin Hekmatyar . They are enemies of the Taliban , but it is rare that the anti-government groups fight each other . A group of 25 Hezb-e-Eslami fighters including their commander surrendered to Afghan National Police on Sunday , the governor said . Separately , two children were killed and two were hurt in an explosion while they were playing in Kandahar province , provincial spokesman Zalmay Ayoubi said Sunday . The explosive device was in a bag that blew up while the children were playing , the Interior Ministry said in a press release . The injured children were transferred to a hospital for treatment . Two NATO service members were killed in southern Afghanistan in two separate incidents on Sunday , a NATO news release said . One was killed by small arms fire and the other by an improvised explosive device , NATO said . The identities and nationalities of the service members were not immediately released , pending notification of the relevant national authorities , the statement said .

638,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old , the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births . A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul , Afghanistan , in October 2007 . The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases . Each year , 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb , the organization said . More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia . `` Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally , physically and financially on families , medical systems and economies , '' March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement . `` In the United States alone , the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $ 26 billion . '' The March of Dimes report , which used data collected by the World Health Organization , breaks down premature birth rates by continent . The highest premature birth rate is in Africa , where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm , with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually . In populous Asia , although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent , the number of premature births is higher , at nearly 7 million a year . While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year , its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa , at 10.6 percent of all births , according to the report . The rate is the world 's second highest . In the United States , the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years , with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase , the organization found . Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births . `` Wherever trend data are available , rates of preterm birth are increasing , '' the report said . Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks , including the possible development of cerebral palsy , blindness , hearing loss , learning disabilities and other chronic conditions , according to the March of Dimes . `` Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers , researchers , health care providers , the media , donor organizations and other stakeholders , '' the report said . `` The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial/ethnic lines in many high-income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve , '' it added . The March of Dimes , a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research , said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers , including diabetes , high blood pressure , nutrition , body weight and tobacco and alcohol use . Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another . While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births , doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor , said Christopher Howson , vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes . `` While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low-resource settings , we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies , '' Howson said .",What is the percentage of the world 's birthrate of premature babies ?,nearly 10 percent
639,"ROME , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Italian newspaper and magazine published excerpts of what they said were audio recordings of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi talking with an escort at the center of a corruption probe . Veronica Lario , the wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , pictured , filed for divorce in May . The daily La Repubblica and its sister magazine L'Espresso said the recordings posted on their Web sites Monday were of Berlusconi and Patrizia D'Addario . She has said that an Italian businessman hired her and other women to attend parties at Berlusconi 's homes . In June , D'Addario told CNN that she had turned the tapes over to a prosecutor in Bari , southern Italy . Through her attorney , she refused to comment on the authenticity of the excerpts released Monday . But in a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA , Berlusconi lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister is challenging the `` truthfulness and legality '' of the recordings . `` We can only regard the material as worthless , completely false and the result of invention , '' Ghedini said . `` In any case , the act of its publication is an illegal act in itself , which will need to be pursued , and all legal actions will be taken against any body who publishes such material . '' Berlusconi , the 72-year-old media mogul-turned-prime minister , has denied the allegations . According to La Repubblica , the conversation between D'Addario and Berlusconi took place in October and November at the prime minister 's house in Rome . It also published an excerpt of what it said was a conversation between D'Addario and Gianpaulo Tarantini , the businessman accused of hiring D'Addario and other escorts . Prosecutors in Bari , in southern Italy , are investigating allegations that Tarantini bribed health officials to buy prosthetics and other medical supplies from a company he and his brother own . Tarantini has denied any wrongdoing and says he brought women to the parties to make a `` beautiful impression . '' `` I have never paid money to those who accompanied me except for refunding their trip expenses , '' he said in a statement issued last month . `` I exclude that the premier could have been aware of these reimbursements and I want to ask forgiveness for having involuntarily damaged him . '' Berlusconi 's private life has been in the spotlight since his wife of 19 years , Veronica Lario , filed for divorce in May . The split followed reports that Berlusconi went to the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old girl , with whom Berlusconi has denied having an inappropriate relationship . And the Spanish newspaper El Pais has published what it said were photos of racy parties at Berlusconi 's villa on the island of Sardinia , including one picture that showed scantily clad women . But despite the swirl of scandal , Berlusconi remains popular , consistently scoring approval ratings well over 50 percent .

640,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno said Sunday the string of sexual child abuse charges against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky are `` shocking . '' Sandusky , 67 , allegedly engaged in fondling , oral and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years , according to an investigative state grand jury 's summary of testimony . He maintains he is innocent . Also named in the state grand jury report are Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley , 57 , and Gary Schultz , 62 , the university 's senior vice president for finance and business . They face one count of perjury each in connection to an alleged cover-up of the abuse . `` If true , the nature and amount of charges made are very shocking to me and all Penn Staters . While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved I ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , '' Paterno said in a statement . The legendary coach said an assistant coach told him in 2002 about an `` incident in the shower of our locker room facility . '' `` It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report . Regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky . As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time , I referred the matter to university administrators , '' Paterno said . Sandusky , who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions , faces seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , and numerous other charges , including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child . In some cases , Sandusky promised boys gifts or invited them to football games and sleepovers , according to the grand jury . `` One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002 , in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus , '' Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Saturday . `` Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old , '' she said . The assistant reported the incident to head football coach Paterno , who in turn alerted athletic director Curley , said Kelly . Instead of reporting the incident to authorities , Curley and Schultz banned Sandusky from having children from Second Mile visit the football building , Kelly said . Sandusky , who retired from coaching in 1999 , was founder of the Second Mile , a charitable organization that began as a group foster home `` dedicated to helping troubled boys , '' the grand jury states . He was arrested and released Saturday on $ 100,000 unsecured bail . `` If this is true we were all fooled , along with scores of professionals trained in such things , and we grieve for the victims and their families . They are in our prayers , '' Paterno said in his statement . He added : `` I understand that people are upset and angry , but let 's be fair and let the legal process unfold . In the meantime I would ask all Penn Staters to continue to trust in what that name represents , continue to pursue their lives every day with high ideals and not let these events shake their beliefs nor who they are .

Crichton also invited controversy with some of his scientific views . He was an avowed skeptic of global climate change , giving lectures warning against `` consensus science .

643,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The House of Representatives approved a plan Friday that would pave the way for an eventual repeal of the military 's controversial `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy , which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service . The measure passed in a largely party-line , 229-186 vote as part of a larger defense authorization bill despite a growing controversy over allegations of wasteful spending in the legislation . Most Democrats backed the bill while most Republicans opposed it . Attention now shifts to the Senate , where the Armed Services Committee approved a `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' repeal earlier in the week . As in the House , the committee was divided sharply along partisan lines . The plan is a compromise under which the repeal would occur only after a military review of the question and subsequent approval by Obama , the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Opponents of the repeal language argue the military should first carry out the review ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates that is scheduled to be completed in December . Only then would military leaders have the necessary information from force members to develop a plan for carrying out the repeal , they claim . Under the compromise , the military would be given time to complete its review as sought by Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. Mike Mullen . Gates and Mullen both said this week they could accept the compromise language . A recent CNN poll seemed to suggest that Americans are ready for the change . The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday indicated that 78 percent of the public supports allowing openly gay people to serve in the military , with one in five opposed . Threatening to derail the plan , however , is House members ' insistence on spending almost $ 500 million on a fighter engine that neither the White House nor the Pentagon wants . Funding for the engine was included in the House 's version of the legislation but not the Senate 's . A White House spokesman warned before the House vote on Friday that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if funding for the engine is n't removed . Gates has blasted the proposed funding for the extra F-35 Joint Strike Fighter engine , calling it a `` waste of money '' that does n't meet the fighter 's performance needs . The chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee said Friday that he hopes Obama would n't veto the plan if Congress failed to remove the controversial funding . `` It 's difficult to believe the president would do anything other than look at the entire bill , not just one provision , '' said Sen. Carl Levin , D-Michigan . Levin would n't predict if the engine funding would still be in the bill by the time it reaches Obama 's desk . `` We are a long way from having a product , '' he said . `` Some of the things which I would think -LRB- Obama -RRB- may not like may be dropped along the way . '' Supporters of repealing the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy have been pressuring congressional Democrats to act now , fearing the party will lose its House or Senate majority in November 's midterm election and be unable to pass the measure afterward . The compromise emerged late Monday from a meeting at the White House involving administration officials , gay rights groups and Pentagon officials , sources told CNN . There were also talks on Capitol Hill involving White House lawyers , Pentagon officials and staff from the offices of influential House and Senate Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the sources added . A senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the Pentagon review process told CNN it is well under way , with a survey going out shortly to about 70,000 troops and families to solicit their views . In addition , the official said , town hall meetings already have been held around the country and more are expected , while a website provides a place for troops to write in their views . The military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement the repeal in terms of housing , medical and marriage benefits , as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy , the official said . A major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman , the official added .

644,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman convicted in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart pleaded guilty in the attempted kidnapping of Smart 's cousin a month later , court officials said Monday . In exchange for Wanda Barzee 's plea of guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping , prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart 's abduction , said Nancy Volmer , spokeswoman for Utah state courts . Barzee , 64 , pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in connection with Smart 's abduction . As part of that plea agreement , she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband , Brian David Mitchell , federal prosecutors have said . Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart , then 14 , at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family 's Salt Lake City home in June 2002 . Smart was found nine months later , walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy , Utah , in the company of Barzee and Mitchell , a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts ' home . The month after Smart was kidnapped , prosecutors alleged , Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin , but were unsuccessful . The girl was 15 years old at the time , according to CNN affiliate KSL . She is not named in court documents . `` Mr. Mitchell 's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened , which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee , '' the court documents said . Following her arrest in 2003 , Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl , and planned to hold her , along with Smart , in the couple 's camp in the mountains , according to court documents . Sentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge , Volmer said . Barzee faces between one and 15 years in prison , but prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence , according to court documents . Federal prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison for her in exchange for her cooperation against Mitchell . Federal sentencing was set for May 19 , but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee 's cooperation against Mitchell is complete . At the hearing in federal court , Barzee apologized to Smart , according to a transcript . `` I 'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it , '' she said . `` I 'm so sorry , Elizabeth , for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family . It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day . '' Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell 's . After years of being declared incompetent , she recently was declared competent to stand trial , according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper . A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated , and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple , the Tribune said . At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October , Smart , now 21 , testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California . Just after her abduction , Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her , she said . During the nine months of her captivity , Smart testified , no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell . U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has not yet ruled on Mitchell 's competency . State court proceedings are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case .

645,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sugar lovers may have to face a bitter truth : The less sugar added to foods for typical people , the better are their blood-fat profiles and the lower are their cardiovascular risks , a study to be published Wednesday concludes . `` We found that the lower the amount of added sugar people ate , the better their good cholesterol and their blood triglyceride levels , '' said co-author Dr. Miriam B. Vos , assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , and author of `` The No-Diet Obesity Solution for Kids . '' Unfortunately for dessert lovers , the converse is true . Increased sugars are associated with important cardiovascular disease risk factors , according to the report . The authors cited lower levels of HDL-C , which is sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol , and higher levels of triglycerides . The study , to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , highlights a trend some nutritionists consider disturbing : In recent years , the typical American 's diet has increasingly incorporated added sugars . The authors defined them as `` caloric sweeteners used by the food industry and consumers as ingredients in processed or prepared foods to increase the desirability of those foods . '' Data from the mid-1990s show that 15.8 percent of the typical American 's diet was composed of added sugar -- 21.4 teaspoons or 359 calories per day . That 's up from 10.6 percent in 1977-1978 . Added sugars have been linked to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay . The researchers studied 6,113 adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . Interviewers called them and asked what they had eaten the previous day , then estimated the total added sugar in each person 's diet . Participants were then separated into groups : Those who got less than 5 percent of total calories from added sugar ; 5 percent to less than 10 percent ; 10 percent to less than 17.5 percent ; 17.5 percent to less than 25 percent ; and 25 percent or more . Those in the highest-consuming added sugar group eat about 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day , the study said . Those who consumed more added sugar tended to be younger , non-Latino blacks with low income , it said . The report says 18.5 percent of Americans get at least 25 percent of their calories from added sugar . The strongest relationship between added sugar and blood fats was found in values for HDL-C , which fell from 58.7 mg/dl for those who ate the least added sugar to 47.7 mg/dl for those who ate the most . A higher HDL-C level is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk . Among some blood fats linked to higher cardiovascular risk , the converse was true : Triglyceride levels went from 105 mg/dl in the group that ate the least sugar to 114 mg/dl in the group that ate the most . The so-called bad cholesterol , LDL-C , went from 116 mg/dl for women who ate the least sugar to 123 mg/dl for women who ate the most . There were no significant trends for LDL-C among men . The authors concluded that their data support dietary guidelines that aim to cut consumption of added sugar . But those guidelines are all over the map . The Institute of Medicine recommends no more than 25 percent of total energy from added sugars ; the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent ; and the American Heart Association has recently advised no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men , which works out to about 5 percent . `` What it really means is we have to go back to things like whole grains and vegetables and fruit and eat things in moderation in order to be healthy , '' Vos said . `` Plus , a good healthy dose of activity . '' But the study compiled data based on a single day 's consumption , and it was not clear whether that day was representative of other days , she said . `` We do n't know that all of the people had their usual diet the day before , '' she said . `` There are always some weaknesses in that kind of data . '' Carbohydrates have been linked for decades to abnormal blood fat levels , `` but a big contemporary issue is added sugars , '' said Dr. Frank Sacks , professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston , Massachusetts . Vos ' study `` fills in a gap in the science base . '' The study will likely be discussed next month when the American Heart Association takes up the matter of added sugars at its meeting in Washington , he said . `` We just overeat too damn much , '' he said . `` What this study is saying is that , for some groups -- especially young people , black , poor -- sugar is just way too big a proportion of their intake . '' `` The real truth is that we 're supposed to eat a balanced diet , less processed food , '' said Carla Wolper , a nutritionist at the Obesity Research Center at St. Luke 's Hospital in New York and assistant professor at Columbia University 's Eating Disorders Center . Wolper praised the study for its size and careful construction . But Dr. Richard K. Bernstein , a diabetes specialist based in Mamaroneck , New York , was unimpressed . `` This is just one more study showing that carbohydrates create abnormal lipid profiles , '' he said .",What is added sugar associated with ?,"obesity , diabetes"
646,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Human rights and freedom of the press in China , the detention of terrorist suspects by the United States and Russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in Amnesty International 's annual report , released Wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . Amnesty International protestors outside the US Supreme Court in January dressed as Guantanamo Bay detainees . The 398-page report comes 60 years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and Amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` The biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . Irene Khan , Amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in Darfur , Zimbabwe , Gaza , Iraq and Myanmar demand immediate attention . '' The report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' According to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . Of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , Amnesty paid particular attention to China , the host of this summer 's Olympic Games . The group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in China in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including Tibetans , Falun Gong practitioners and Christians -- repressed or persecuted . Death penalty statistics in China are difficult to assess , Amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . Amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in China and said censorship of the Internet and other media intensified last year . `` The Chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` They decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . The authorities continued to block Web sites and to filter Internet content based on specified words and topics . '' Around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , Amnesty said . Amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the United States , where 42 people were executed last year . It noted New Jersey 's decision in December to abolish the death penalty made it the first U.S. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . As it has in previous annual reports , Amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . `` The USA must close Guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' Amnesty said . The group noted that Guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to U.S. courts . Most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , Amnesty said . In fact , more is written on the United States than any other country listed in the report . Asked about that at a press conference Tuesday , Khan said , `` We certainly devote a lot of time to Sudan , to China , to Zimbabwe and other countries . But we look to the U.S. to provide leadership around the world . Governments around the world look to the United States as a role model for their own behavior . '' In a lengthy section on Iraq , Amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` All sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . Abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million Iraqis to flee to Syria , Jordan and elsewhere , Amnesty said . U.S. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' In Afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` At least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` Violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including Afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' Russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , Amnesty said . `` The Russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` A crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the State Duma -LSB- parliament -RSB- elections in December . '' The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in Chechnya , Amnesty said . There were fewer reported disappearances in the Chechen Republic in 2007 than in previous years , Amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . The report also criticized human rights conditions in Iran , Gaza and Myanmar . Human rights conditions in Zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression . '' Members of the main opposition party , the MDC , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , Amnesty said . Some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in `` deplorable conditions '' while President Robert Mugabe 's government failed to remedy their situation . `` Human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us , '' Khan said . `` Governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the United Nations to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 60 years ago . ''",What countries are noted ?,"Darfur , Zimbabwe , Gaza , Iraq and Myanmar"
648,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama has been charged with piracy , a count that carries a minimum life sentence . Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrives in the United States on Monday . He was charged with piracy Tuesday . Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse also has been charged with conspiracy to seize a ship by force , conspiracy to commit hostage-taking and two firearm charges , according to a criminal complaint released by the U.S. attorney 's office in the southern district of New York . Muse `` conducted himself as the leader '' of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama , according to the criminal complaint . A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Muse could be tried as an adult . U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck had ordered the media and public out of the courtroom earlier while he evaluated Muse 's age . Muse 's father in Somalia told defense attorneys the young man was born on November 20 , 1993 -- making him 15 , the defense attorneys said . However , the prosecution argued otherwise , saying Muse made statements that suggest he is older . Before Peck closed the courtroom , Muse wiped his hand over his face at one point , and it appeared he was crying . He had worn a broad smile late Monday when he arrived in New York escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers . See timeline of events that led to piracy case '' Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama , a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast . See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa '' Peck read the young man his rights and said attorneys had been appointed to represent him because the suspect did not have the resources to hire representation himself . Muse said through an interpreter that he understood and said , `` I do n't have any money . '' Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama , a cargo ship , on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast . According to the criminal complaint , two of the 20 crew members -- all Americans -- saw lights heading toward the Maersk Alabama around 4:30 a.m. on April 8 , while the ship was in the Indian Ocean . After a `` brief time , '' the lights disappeared , the complaint said , but about two hours later , the same crew members saw a small boat approaching and later heard `` what sounded like '' gunshots , the complaint said . Crew Member 1 then heard the ship 's captain -- later identified as Capt. Richard Phillips -- on the radio saying that two pirates were on the ship 's bridge . A third crew member , Crew Member 3 , also heard the radio message and began shutting down the ship 's power , the complaint said . The complaint said Muse , who was carrying a gun , was the first alleged pirate on the ship , and said the attackers used a portable ladder to climb on board . According to the complaint , Muse had fired his gun at Phillips , the captain said , and then took $ 30,000 from the ship 's safe after he forced Phillips to open it . Watch Muse being hauled into court '' Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship 's owner , the complaint said . The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so , the complaint said , citing Crew Member 2 . Muse then began canvassing the dark ship with Crew Member 2 as a guide , the complaint said . While they were going through the ship , Crew Member 3 , who had not come to the bridge , tackled Muse to the ground , the complaint said . Crew Member 2 helped subdue Muse , and the two tied the young man 's hands with wire and took him to the ship 's safe room , where several crew members were hiding . After several hours , the remaining pirates said they would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them , and if a lifeboat was given to them . Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship 's crew freed Muse , who then boarded the lifeboat , according to the criminal complaint . The boat floated a short distance from the Maersk , even as the Navy 's USS Bainbridge arrived the next day . Over the next three days , officers on the Bainbridge communicated with the pirates by radio . `` In those communications , the pirates threatened to kill the captain if they were not provided with safe passage away from the scene , '' the complaint said . At one point , Phillips tried to escape and the pirates shot at him , the complaint said . On April 12 , Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips ' release . Muse also received medical treatment while he was on the warship , the complaint said . While Muse was away from the lifeboat , Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates . The U.S. Navy recovered two loaded AK-47 assault rifles ; two gunstraps , each containing three AK-47 magazines ; one handgun magazine ; and multiple cell phones and handheld radios from the lifeboat , according to the complaint .

651,"Rome , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Vatican did not know about an American priest believed to have molested up to 200 boys until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and then dropped the case , its top spokesman said Thursday . Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi issued the statement in response to a New York Times story alleging that top Vatican officials , including the future Pope Benedict XVI , failed to discipline or defrock the now-deceased Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy of Wisconsin , despite warnings from several American bishops . But Jeff Anderson , a lawyer who obtained the internal church paperwork the newspaper based its story on , said it `` shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope . '' Lombardi rejected the accusation . `` During the mid-1970s , some of Father Murphy 's victims reported his abuse to civil authorities , who investigated him at that time , '' Lombardi said . `` However , according to news reports , that investigation was dropped . '' The Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , who would later become pope , `` was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later , '' Lombardi said . The office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked . `` The case of Lawrence Murphy has been well-documented since the mid-1970s , when allegations were first reported to civil authorities , although criminal charges were not filed , '' the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said in a statement Thursday . `` Murphy 's actions were criminal , and we sincerely apologize to those who have been harmed . The Archdiocese of Milwaukee continues to reach out to victims-survivors who were harmed by Lawrence Murphy and encourages them to report any abuse they suffered . '' Anderson , a lawyer representing five men who are suing the archdiocese , obtained correspondence from Milwaukee to Ratzinger as part of the lawsuit , along with other internal church documents related to the case . The documents , dating to 1974 , include letters between bishops and the Vatican , victims ' affidavits , the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Murphy and minutes of a final Vatican meeting on the case . Murphy began as a teacher for St. John 's School for the Deaf in St. Francis , Wisconsin , in 1950 , and was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation , according to the documents , which CNN has seen . Many of Murphy 's victims were hearing-impaired . Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from Milwaukee 's then-archbishop , Rembert G. Weakland . After eight months , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who at the time was second in command of the doctrinal office and now is the Vatican 's secretary of state , told Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial , the documents show . Lombardi said that church rules did not mean a priest would automatically be punished but that punishment , if warranted , could include being defrocked . `` In such cases , the Code of Canon Law does not envision automatic penalties but recommends that a judgment be made not excluding even the greatest ecclesiastical penalty of dismissal from the clerical state , '' he said . `` In light of the facts that Father Murphy was elderly and in very poor health , and that he was living in seclusion and no allegations of abuse had been reported in over 20 years , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith suggested that the Archbishop of Milwaukee give consideration to addressing the situation by , for example , restricting Father Murphy 's public ministry and requiring that Father Murphy accept full responsibility for the gravity of his acts , '' the statement said , noting that Murphy died four months later . Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told of the abuse , but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities , according to Anderson , the lawyer . Lombardi , however , said that neither canon law nor Vatican norms prohibit the reporting of such cases to law enforcement . But `` he did not address why that had never happened in this case , '' the Times said . The Archdiocese of Milwaukee said abuse was reported in fall 1973 to Milwaukee police , who turned the report over to St. Francis police , but no charges were filed . Murphy was removed in May 1974 as director of the St. John 's School for the Deaf but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974 , when he was removed from any role at the school , according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese Web site . In August 1974 , a series of newspaper articles in the Milwaukee Sentinel reported on Murphy 's removal and the allegations , the chronology said . In September , he relocated to a family home in the Diocese of Superior . A district attorney reviewed the allegations against Murphy in fall 1974 , according to the archdiocese . A civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to Murphy but was resolved the following year , the chronology said . Murphy 's request for retirement was accepted in January 1993 , but restrictions against him were reinstated that year and reinforced twice . The bishops warned the Vatican , according to the newspaper , that failure to act on the matter could result in embarrassment to the Church . `` The tragic case of Father Lawrence Murphy , a priest of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee , involved particularly vulnerable victims who suffered terribly , '' Lombardi said in the statement . `` By sexually abusing children who were hearing-impaired , Father Murphy violated the law and , more importantly , the sacred trust that his victims had placed in him . `` In the late 1990s , after over two decades had passed since the abuse had been reported to diocesan officials and the police , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was presented for the first time with the question of how to treat the Murphy case canonically , '' the statement said . At the time , there was no procedure in place for reporting church abuse to the doctrinal office , according to Vatican sources . The office was informed of the matter , Lombardi said , because it involved abuse at confession , which is a violation of the Sacrament of Penance . St. John 's School for the Deaf closed in 1983 , the archdiocese said in its statement . `` Most importantly , today , no priest with any substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor serves in public ministry in any way in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee .

654,"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two bombings in separate Iraq provinces on Monday killed eight U.S. troops , the U.S. military said . A boy with a machine gun weeps Monday at the site of a suicide bombing in Kanan that killed a sheik . A roadside bomb killed three U.S. soldiers and an interpreter in Diyala province , which has been a major front in the war during the `` surge '' of U.S. troops fighting insurgents near the capital . Earlier in the day , at least five U.S. soldiers on foot patrol were killed and three others wounded in a suicide bombing in Baghdad . In addition , suicide bombers killed five Iraqis in two bombings in Diyala province Monday morning , including a sheik who helped battle Sunni extremists and his 5-year-old niece . Watch new suicide tactics in Iraq '' Four U.S. soldiers died at the scene Monday 's Baghdad blast and one more died later of wounds , the military said . They were with Multi-National Division-Baghdad . An Iraqi interpreter also was wounded in the explosion , the officials said . Initial reports indicate the bomber was wearing an explosive vest . `` Five soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Iraqi and American people . I ask you remember these fallen heroes and their families as well as their wounded brethren in your thoughts and prayers , '' said Col. Allen Batschelet , chief of staff for Multi-National Division-Baghdad . `` We remain resolute in our resolve to protect the people of Iraq and kill or capture those who would bring them harm . '' The explosion marks the deadliest attack against the U.S. military since five soldiers were killed January 28 in a roadside bombing in Mosul . Troops killed a Saudi insurgent whose network was responsible for that attack . Earlier , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said one person was killed and eight people were wounded in a suicide bomb attack targeting a U.S. military convoy in western Baghdad . It is not clear if the U.S. and Iraqi reports are about the same incident . Monday 's attacks would bring the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq this month to 10 . A total of 3,983 military personnel have died in the nearly 5-year-old war . The attack came after a bomber near Baquba targeted the leader of a security group assisting U.S. troops . The teen suicide bomber killed a sheik and a 5-year-old , a day after she went to the sheik 's Kanan home claiming to need help finding her husband , police and family members said . The female suicide bomber , 18 , blew herself up at the sheik 's home Monday morning , police said . The tribal leader was the head of a local citizens group that has been working with U.S. forces to rout out insurgents . The largely Sunni security groups are known as Awakening Councils . Kanan is east of Baquba , situated in the volatile Diyala province , which has been a major front for the `` surge '' of U.S.-led troops targeting militants near Baghdad . According to one of the sheik 's cousins , the teen bomber went to the sheik 's house Sunday to ask him for help finding her husband -- thought to be kidnapped or detained . The 18-year-old was told to return Monday , the cousin said . She returned Monday and staged the attack , killing the sheik , his 5-year-old niece and one of his security guards , police said . The attack reflects both the growing use of females as suicide bombers in Iraq and the targeting of Awakening Councils , which are also known as Concerned Citizens Groups or Sons of Iraq . The grass-roots groups , which are sometimes led by former insurgents , have drawn more than 90,000 volunteers to their ranks , military spokesman Rear Adm. Gregory said Sunday . Since November , there have been at least five attacks carried out by female suicide bombers , including a twin bombing at Baghdad pet markets last month that killed almost 100 people . Insurgent groups , particularly al Qaeda in Iraq , are increasingly using women as suicide bombers because they are less likely to be searched , the U.S. military has said . About an hour after the attack at the sheik 's home , another suicide bomber approached Iraqi security forces in Muqdadiya and blew himself up as the forces began shooting at him . The blast killed two civilians and wounded 20 others , including two police officers , authorities said . Muqdadiya also is in Diyala province . In other developments : • A suicide car bomb exploded Monday outside an upscale hotel in Sulaimaniya , killing two people and wounding at least 32 others , police said . The blast occurred at the Sulaimani Palace hotel , located in the center of the city . It is in northern Iraq 's Kurdish region and is a common stop for visiting government officials , businessmen and contractors . • Two bombings in Baghdad on Monday killed an Iraqi and wounded nine others , an Interior Ministry official said . A parked car bomb exploded near an outdoor market in Shaab , a Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad , killing a civilian and wounding seven others . A roadside bomb exploded on a highway near a U.S. military patrol in eastern Baghdad , wounding two bystanders . • Coalition troops north of Baghdad killed five insurgents and detained 19 people in raids , the U.S. military said Monday . The Sunday raids were part of coalition forces ' `` untiring efforts to remove al Qaeda from Iraq , '' said Lt. Col. Maura Gillen , a Multi-National Forces-Iraq spokeswoman . • Several U.S. troops may have been sickened by dirty water intended for hygiene use and supplied to bases around Iraq between 2004 and 2006 , according to a Pentagon report released Monday . However , the Department of Defense inspector general 's report points out that because the water was not monitored , it is impossible to tell for sure if it was dirty and if it contributed to the troops getting sick .

655,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of boxing great Joe Frazier on Wednesday announced details of his Philadelphia funeral services and said he died as `` one of God 's men . '' Frazier , who handed the legendary Muhammad Ali his first defeat , died Monday , just a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer . The 67-year-old athlete 's remains will be in public view at the Wells Fargo Center from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Saturday , the family said . `` This will be an opportunity for his many fans , supporters and boxing lovers from around the world to pay their final respects to Joe Frazier . '' The service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church . `` The Family of Joe Frazier continues to stress that they want everyone to know that Joe Frazier was a man of God and a man who loved all of his family , '' relatives said in a statement . Star boxer Floyd `` Money '' Mayweather offered to pay for Frazier 's funeral . The family said donations in Frazier 's memory can be made to the American Cancer Society . The former heavyweight champion became a legend in his own right and personified the gritty working-class style of his hard-knuckled hometown , Philadelphia -- a fitting setting for the `` Rocky '' film series , starring Sylvester Stallone as hardscrabble boxer Rocky Balboa . Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called Frazier the `` quintessential Philadelphia boxer . '' `` You could hear him coming , snorting and grunting and puffing , like a steam engine climbing a steep grade , '' Bill Lyon wrote in a Philadelphia Inquirer column about Frazier , nicknamed `` Smokin ' Joe . '' Frazier used his devastating left hook with impunity during his professional career , retiring in 1976 with a 32-4-1 record and staging one last comeback fight in 1981 . Frazier bested Ali at 1971 's `` Fight of the Century '' at Madison Square Garden . In the 15th round , Frazier landed perhaps the most famous left hook in history , catching Ali on the jaw and dropping the former champ for a four-count , according to Frazier 's bio at the International Boxing Hall of Fame . Frazier left the ring as the undisputed champ and handed Ali his first professional loss . Ali won a 12-round decision in a January 1974 rematch , setting the stage for the classic `` Thrilla in Manila '' just outside the Philippine capital in 1975 . Ali took the early rounds , but Frazier rebounded before losing the last five rounds . By the end of the 14th , Frazier 's eyes were nearly swollen shut , and his corner stopped the bout , according to the biography . Frazier , a two-time heavyweight champion for nearly three years until he lost in January 1973 to George Foreman , ran a well-known boxing gym in Philadelphia for years .",When are services taking place ?,11 a.m. Monday
656,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an important milestone Wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid : For the first time in eight months , her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's campaign committee reported owing $ 2.3 million in debt at the end of March . On a day most Americans were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes , Clinton 's campaign committee filed finance documents with the Federal Election Commission , reporting a total of $ 2.3 million in debts at the end of March , compared with $ 2.6 million in the bank . The nation 's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her White House bid in June 2008 , when her debt peaked at $ 25.2 million . That amount covered $ 12 million owed to vendors , as well as the $ 13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds . Clinton 's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the Democratic National Convention convened in Denver , Colorado , last August , the deadline mandated by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law . The former New York senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount . Her campaign owed $ 6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of November ; $ 5.9 million to five creditors at the end of December ; and the current $ 2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of March . That creditor is Penn , Schoen & Berland , a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid . The firm 's president , Mark Penn , was Clinton 's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last April amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of Colombia for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal that Clinton opposed . Penn remained involved with the campaign . Earlier this year , Clinton and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation 's 67th secretary of state on January 21 . As of that date , Clinton became subject to a federal law known as the Hatch Act , which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions . The Hatch Act allows others to keep raising money on Clinton 's behalf , without her direct involvement . This week , longtime Clinton ally James Carville , a CNN contributor , sent a fundraising e-mail to Democrats on behalf of Clinton 's campaign , requesting contributions of as little as $ 5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes , including spending a day with former President Bill Clinton . `` I wo n't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary , '' Carville e-mailed . `` I know what she means to you , and I 'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations . '' It 's unclear whether the campaign will use the $ 2.6 million in the bank to clear its $ 2.3 million in debts in the short term . Continued fundraising indicates that it will not . Additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge . Any extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors . Clinton 's campaign reported raising $ 938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009 . In addition to tapping traditional fundraising , the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations . It received $ 2.6 million from Clinton 's `` Friends of Hillary '' U.S. Senate campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $ 2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters . Organizations that have rented Clinton 's lists include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , the inaugural committee of then-President-elect Barack Obama , and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation . Those organizations each paid $ 274,297 . Clinton 's political action committee , HillPAC , rented the lists for $ 822,492 . Among the Democratic candidates who have rented Clinton 's campaign lists are Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln ; Virginia gubernatorial candidate and former Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe ; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who was appointed to fill Clinton 's seat ; and New York congressional candidate Scott Murphy , who hopes to succeed Gillibrand in the U.S. House .",Did her campaign committee reported about any money at the bank ?,more money in the bank than it owes
657,"HONG KONG , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hong Kong authorities Sunday announced that two recalled candy products made by British confectioner Cadbury had high levels of melamine . The industrial chemical has recently been found in Chinese-made milk products that have sickened nearly 53,000 children in China , killing four . Countries around the world have since banned the import of Chinese products containing milk , or have withdrawn products that contain milk from China -- such as candy -- amid worries they contain melamine . Last week , Cadbury recalled all of its Chinese-made candy products after preliminary tests showed they contained trace amounts of melamine . Cadbury took the action because `` no level of melamine is appropriate , '' spokesman Tony Bilsborough told CNN on Sunday . He could not comment on the latest test results . The company stresses that its products manufactured at its Beijing plant are only exported to Taiwan and Hong Kong , with one product -- Cadbury Eclair -- sent to Australia , Nauru and Christmas Island . Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety tested 104 samples of products made by a variety of manufacturers , including Cadbury , Nestle , and some U.S. and Chinese companies . Only two of the samples showed unsatisfactory levels of melamine -- Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate -LRB- bulk pack 5kg -RRB- and Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate -LRB- bulk pack 5kg -RRB- . The sample of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate contained melamine levels of 65 ppm -LRB- parts per million -RRB- which is more than 25 times the acceptable level of 2.5 ppm , according to Hong Kong 's government . According to the center , a child weighing 22 pounds -LRB- 10kg -RRB- would have to eat more than 10 small pieces of the hazelnut chocolate to surpass the tolerable daily intake . An average adult weighing 132 pounds -LRB- 60kg -RRB- would have to eat more than 112 small pieces to surpass the level . The melamine levels in the samples of Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate were 6.9 ppm -- more than twice as high as the legal limit of melamine . Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety said it will continue to test dairy products and other products with dairy ingredients . Test results on other products -- including milk powder , soya drinks , yogurt , butter , baby food and frozen confections -- would be released on Monday , it said . Chinese authorities have implicated 22 Chinese dairy companies in the tainted milk scandal . Investigators suspect people watered down milk in an attempt to sell more of it , and added melamine in order to fool quality checks , Chinese authorities have said . The toxic chemical is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk . On Saturday China announced that a test of 607 batches of liquid milk from 27 cities found the samples to be melamine-free , state-run media said . The tests were the sixth Chinese officials have carried out since melamine was discovered in powdered infant formula last month . Chinese authorities have promised to subsidize farmers hit by the shrinking demand for milk , the news agency Xinhua said . Among them is the northern Hebei province , which has earmarked 316 million yuan -LRB- $ 46.1 million -RRB- for subsidies . That translates to giving a farmer 200 yuan -LRB- $ 29 -RRB- per cow , Xinhua said . Melamine is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk . Chinese authorities have arrested 40 people in connection with the scandal , including two brothers who could face the death penalty if convicted .

660,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Headley , the Chicago , Illinois , man appearing in court Wednesday in connection with terror attacks in India , was born Daood Gilani , the son of a prominent Pakistani broadcaster , according to his half-brother . He grew up in both the United States and Pakistan , with a parent from each country . Headley 's father , Syed Saleem Gilani , was working for the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America when Headley was born in 1960 in Washington , his half-brother Danyal Gilani said in a statement . Headley 's mother was American , and his parents divorced after they moved to Pakistan together , not long after Headley was born , his half-brother said . He did not name the mother . His mother returned to the United States , but Headley remained in Pakistan , his half-brother said , citing `` family elders . '' Headley went to high school at the Hassan Abdal Cadet College in Pakistan , Gilani and an FBI complaint against Headley indicate . At some point after high school , Headley moved back to the United States to be with his mother , and has had little contact with his Pakistani family since then , Gilani said . Gilani last saw Headley , whom he still refers to as Daood , `` when he visited Pakistan a few days after my father 's death , nearly a year ago . '' He got a Social Security number in Pennsylvania sometime in the late 1970s , public records show . He changed his name from Daood Gilani to David Headley on or about February 15 , 2006 , in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in order to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani , according to the criminal complaint against him . `` His having another name or changing his name at some stage in life has come as a surprise to me . He has four kids and a Pakistani wife who also live in the United States , '' said Danyal Gilani , a public relations officer for the Pakistani prime minister 's office . He issued a long statement last month distancing himself from his half-brother , in response to reports in the Indian press trying to link Headley to Pakistan 's prime minister , whose last name also is Gilani . But Danyal Gilani said his family was not related to the prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani . Headley was arrested by federal agents on October 3 in Chicago , accused of helping plan terror attacks against a Danish newspaper that ran cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed , sparking Muslim anger worldwide . He was later linked to the bloody four-day terrorist siege in Mumbai , India , in November 2008 in which 160 people were killed . The Justice Department accuses him of attending terrorism training camps in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003 , and working with the group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to carry out terror attacks . The United States lists Lashkar as a terrorist organization . India blamed the group for the Mumbai attacks . At the time of his arrest October 3 , Headley was on his way back to India to plan a second attack , a source close to the investigation said . Headley is cooperating with the authorities investigating both terror plots , the Justice Department has said . His lawyer did not dispute that . Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed , a retired major in the Pakistani military , was also charged with conspiracy in planning to attack the Danish newspaper . So was Tahawwur Hussain Rana , whom U.S. authorities identify as a Pakistani native and Canadian citizen who lives mainly in Chicago .

According to the survey , Latino registered voters favor Obama over Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney or Texas Gov. Rick Perry by margin of more than 2-to-1 .

The Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church . The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites , Vatican officials said . The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England , forerunner of the Anglican Communion . The parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests , said the Rev. James Massa , ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops . `` This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions , '' Massa said . The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships , said Cardinal William Joseph Levada , the head of the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . Their talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up , Vatican officials said , leading to Tuesday 's announcement . `` The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , '' Levada said . Levada said `` hundreds '' of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church . Among them are 50 Anglican bishops , said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship . While married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests , the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops , Levada said . `` We 've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we 've not anticipated it happening now , '' Di Noia said . `` The Holy Spirit is at work here . '' One interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion , an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide . The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites . The TAC 's primate , Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia , said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican 's announcement `` more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago . '' That is because the Vatican 's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church , said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams , bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America , which is part of the TAC . The Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer , and the TAC 's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does , Williams said . But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably . Williams , who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley , California , said his parishioners have generally been `` very warmly receiving '' Tuesday 's announcement . `` It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience would n't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church , '' Williams said . `` The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray . We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office , in addition to praying for our primate . `` Really , there 'd be very little other difference . '' The parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide `` personal ordinariates '' who would report to the pope , Massa said . Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy , Vatican officials said . The Church of England said the move ends a `` period of uncertainty '' for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church . Both groups have a `` substantial overlap in faith , doctrine and spirituality '' and will continue to hold official dialogues , the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement . `` Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full , visible unity in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic church , '' Levada said . `` At the same time , they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey . '' Preserving Anglican traditions , such as mass rites , adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church , he said . `` The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity , as the history of Christianity shows , '' he said . `` Moreover , the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians : ` There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism .

666,"UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe 's longtime president , Robert Mugabe , and 11 senior members of his government . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets this week with Arthur Mutambara , an opposition leader . According to a draft of the resolution , the measure would have instituted a travel ban on Mugabe and others in his government , frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime . The measure received nine votes -- the minimum for it to pass . However , two of the five negative votes were from Russia and China , who as permanent members of the Security Council have veto power . One Security Council member abstained . The resolution was pushed by the United States after Mugabe ignored the Security Council 's appeal to postpone the June 27 presidential runoff election . The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai . But Tsvangirai withdrew days before , saying Mugabe 's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings , intimidation and murders against his supporters . With their votes , ambassadors for China and Russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the Security Council . Representatives from Mugabe 's party , the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front -LRB- ZANU-PF -RRB- , have been meeting in Pretoria , South Africa , with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change this week . Tsvangirai said Wednesday the talks , which are being mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki , are focusing on `` how to move forward . '' Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions . Wang said the adoption of the resolution would `` unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation . '' `` Many countries , including China , repeatedly called upon the Security Council to respect the position of the African countries on this question and give more time , '' Wang said . `` China has always maintained the best approach to solve a problem is negotiation and dialogue , '' Wang said . `` To use or threaten to use sanctions lightly is not conducive to solving the problem . '' Wang 's comments echoed those of Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , who said the Security Council would have overstepped its responsibilities had it approved the resolution . `` Recently , in the positions of a number of council member states , we have seen an ever-more-obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security , '' Churkin said . `` We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous , leading to a realignment of the entire U.N. system . '' Churkin also noted that , had the resolution been approved , council members would have ignored appeals from the African Union to let the South African talks take place . He also accused the council of missing an opportunity to coordinate a response that would have `` promoted the success of the political dialogue '' in Zimbabwe . Speaking before the vote , Zimbabwean Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said his nation has been a victim of `` incessant meddling '' from the international community . Chidyausiku blamed sanctions already imposed on Zimbabwe for its underperforming economy and the suffering of its people . South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo also urged the Security Council to give the South African talks a chance to bring about a resolution . U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the United States was disappointed at the veto . `` China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground , '' he said . `` The U-turn on the Russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing , '' he said , noting that a few days ago , the Russian Federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the Group of Eight meeting in Japan expressing `` grave concern '' about the situation in Zimbabwe . `` The Russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a G-8 partner , '' Khalilzad said . The draft resolution expressed `` deep concern at the gross irregularities '' during the presidential election , saying violence and intimidation before the runoff prevented `` free and fair elections , '' creating `` an environment that did not permit international election observers to operate freely before the June 27 vote . '' The United Kingdom , which has been highly critical of Mugabe , was a chief supporter of the United States push for sanctions . France also supported the resolution . `` The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa , '' British Ambassador John Sawers said after the vote . Watch the British Ambassador to the U.N. speaks about the failed resolution '' Sawers also questioned Mbeki 's efficacy as a mediator in Zimbabwe 's affairs . `` We have to be realistic . Those efforts have so far come to naught . The only one who has benefited to date is Mr. Mugabe , '' he said . After the vote , Chidyausiku thanked the council for heeding his call . `` Today we have seen reason , '' he said . `` I want to express our gratitude to the people in the Security Council who managed to see reason and refused to be intimidated or cowed into following the national interests of the U.S. and UK . '' The Zimbabwean people , he said , are `` committed to resolve their differences .

667,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An international peace conference in Johannesburg has been cancelled after South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend the event . Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he would boycott the conference . Announcing the postponement at a news conference Tuesday , Irvin Khosa , chairman of the South African football league , did not offer an explanation . A presidential spokesman , Thabo Masebe , said little . '' South Africa has made this decision , '' he said . `` We stand by the decision . '' The peace conference had been scheduled to start Friday . Officials said they would like to have a conference in the future , but they did not offer a specific date . The conference had been organized by South African soccer officials , led by Khosa , and was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa 's role as a human-rights champion ahead of the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship the nation will host next year . The presidential spokesman had said earlier that the Dalai Lama -- Tibet 's spiritual leader and a Nobel Laureate -- did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa 's interest for him to attend . Masebe said South Africa thinks that , if the Dalai Lama attended the conference , the focus would shift away from the World Cup . `` We can not allow focus to shift to China and Tibet , '' he said . He added that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China . Khosa made the announcement at a news conference also attended by Chief Mandla Mandela , grandson of former South African President Nelson Mandela . Mandla Mandela said it was a sad day for the country 's democracy and the African continent that the South African government had denied the Dalai Lama a visa . South Africa should not succumb to international pressure , Mandela said . A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the visa refusal . The Tibetan government in exile thinks that China has pressured many countries to refuse a visit by the Dalai Lama , according to Chhime Chhoekyapa , an aide in Dharamsala , India . The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule . The peace conference was to bring together Nobel laureates and top soccer officials . Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; former President F.W.

668,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama will address the future of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Thursday morning in a speech at the National Archives . The Guantanamo facility houses terror suspects , and lawmakers do n't want them in the U.S. . In a speech that is being billed as a major address , Obama is also slated to discuss issues of state secrets , transparency and protecting national security , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . Former Vice President Dick Cheney , one of the most outspoken critics of Obama 's policies , is scheduled to give an opposing argument Thursday morning . Cheney has charged that Obama 's national security decisions have left the United States more vulnerable to attack . Obama 's address is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET at the National Archives . Cheney will speak before the conservative American Enterprise Institute at 10:45 a.m. Obama is hoping to rally support behind his national security measures after angering some with his decision to resume the Bush administration practice of military tribunals and by reversing course on his decision to release photos of alleged inmate abuse at Guantanamo . On Wednesday , Obama was dealt another blow when the U.S. Senate passed a measure that would prevent detainees at Guantanamo Bay from being transferred to the United States for now . The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in a 90-6 vote . A similar amendment has already passed the House . It was attached to a supplemental war funding bill . Following in the steps of House Democrats , Senate Democrats rejected on Tuesday the administration 's request for $ 80 million to close the Guantanamo facility . They instead asked that President Obama first submit a plan spelling out what the administration will do with the prisoners when it closes the prison . Obama , in one of his first official duties as president , announced that he would close the prison by January 22 , 2010 . Congressional Democrats , however , are now attempting to avoid an onslaught of criticism from Republicans , who argue it would be reckless to shutter the prison before deciding where to transfer the detainees . FBI Director Robert Mueller told members of Congress earlier Wednesday that he is concerned about the potential dangers that may result from the release of detainees in the United States . In response to a question from Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , Mueller said he is concerned about the potential for fundraising to support terrorist groups and the radicalization of others , as well as the potential for attacks within the country . Mueller also said that while he is not concerned about dangerous terrorists escaping from maximum security federal prisons , he is concerned about the potential of activities being directed from within prison walls , and he cited such actions by dangerous gang members . Attorney General Eric Holder , the president 's point man overseeing the Guantanamo plan , sought to downplay the FBI director 's concerns and the Senate vote to bar funds . `` The concerns that have been expressed by the director and concerns expressed by other people will all be taken into account in formulating the plan that we will ultimately use , '' Holder told reporters late Wednesday . `` We 're not going to do anything that 's going to put the American people at risk , '' he said . The attorney general continued to express confidence that the Guantanamo Bay prison camp will be permanently closed by Obama 's deadline . iReport.com : Sound off on Obama , Cheney speeches `` We will have conversations with Congress , and I 'm confident that as a result of those conversations , the necessary funds will come our way , '' Holder said .

669,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A visit to the Eiffel Tower , the Statue of Liberty and the Pyramids is on the itinerary of most jet-setting travelers . Visiting the Eiffel Tower was voted the most overrated experience by tourists . But some of the most famous and iconic tourist attractions in the world are the most disappointing to actually visit , according to a survey of British tourists . And those questioned did n't think too highly of their own country 's best-known landmarks either , with Big Ben , Buckingham Palace and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain also turning people cold . Travel expert Felice Hardy explained why many tourists , often after spending inflated amounts on reaching and then viewing the most famous places , are left with a feeling of anti-climax . `` It 's easy to be swayed by brochures that opt for the mainstream and focus on clichéd tourist sights around the world , '' she said . `` But many of them are overcrowded and disappointing . `` Pick carefully and do n't always go for the obvious . Natural phenomena are usually more exciting than the man-made , and can be wonderfully free of tourists . '' The Eiffel Tower -- described by Hardy as `` frustratingly overcrowded and overpriced '' -- was dubbed the most disappointing international sight . Britain 's biggest letdown was Stonehenge , a sacred Druid sight in the rural south of England , which was dismissed as `` an isolated pile of rocks in a usually muddy field '' by Hardy . The Diana fountain resembled `` a colorless wet skateboard park '' while as far as Big Ben was concerned : `` Once you 've seen it , you 'll know what time it is -- time to go somewhere else . '' Three of America 's most famous sights -- New York 's Times Square and Statue of Liberty plus The White House in Washington also made the list of shame . But the 1,267 adults questioned by Virgin Travel Insurance also nominated the best places to visit in the world , with the Treasury in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan topping the list .

670,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A three-judge federal appeals court panel Tuesday overturned a lower court 's order blocking key parts of a Texas law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion , potentially clearing the way for enforcement of the law . In August , just before the law was set to take effect September 1 , U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin , Texas , found several portions of the law `` unconstitutionally vague , '' and ruled it violated the First Amendment by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government-mandated speech . But a panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Sparks ' injunction against enforcing the law , saying opponents did not prove it violated the Constitution . The panel remanded the suit back to the lower court for further proceedings . As written , the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure . Sparks ' injunction blocked Texas from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who failed to place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them , or does not make the fetus ' heartbeat audible . It also blocked penalties against the woman . A previous U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Pennsylvania case `` held that the fact that such truthful , accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision , '' U.S. Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a concurring opinion . `` Insisting that a doctor give this information in his traditional role of securing informed consent is permissible . '' `` Today 's ruling is a victory for all who stand in defense of life , '' Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement . `` Every life lost to abortion is a tragedy , and this important sonogram legislation ensures that every Texas woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying , and understands the devastating impact of such a life-ending decision . `` We will continue to fight any attempt to limit our state 's laws that value and protect the unborn , '' Perry said . The suit was filed by the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights . Nancy Northrup , the center 's president and CEO , said the court decision was `` extreme . '' `` This clears the way for the enforcement of an insulting and intrusive law whose sole purpose is to harass women and dissuade them from exercising their constitutionally protected reproductive rights , '' Northrup said in a statement . `` Until today , every court that has reviewed similarly intrusive laws have ruled the laws unconstitutional . '' The law , she said , `` serves only to place multiple hurdles between women and the free and full exercise of their reproductive rights . '' The center , she said , is evaluating `` all available means '' to challenge the Texas law `` and all laws that seek to undermine women 's fundamental rights . '' The bill generated some controversy in Texas , but easily passed through the state 's House and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed , women must undergo a sonogram , a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image . The doctor is required to give , `` in a manner understandable to a layperson , a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images , including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus , the presence of cardiac activity and the presence of external members and internal organs , '' the law says .

671,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Philippines President Gloria Arroyo was stopped from boarding a plane at Manila 's Ninoy Aquino International Airport Tuesday , hours after the country 's Supreme Court overruled government-imposed restrictions on her travels . The Philippines government fears that Arroyo , who is facing allegations of corruption and electoral fraud , will flee if allowed to leave the country . But the Supreme Court ruled 8-5 in favor of a temporary restraining order on the travel ban , declaring it was unconstitutional as Arroyo has yet to be formally charged with a crime . A Supreme Court spokesman , Midas Marquez , told reporters the court 's ruling was `` consistent with the constitutional presumption of innocence . '' Arroyo was reportedly boarding the flight to seek medical treatment abroad for her bone disease diagnosed earlier this year , following three unsuccessful spinal operations in the Philippines . She arrived at the airport in an ambulance and was transported to the departure gate in a wheelchair while wearing a neck brace . Arroyo 's lawyer , Raul Lambino , told CNN that the former first couple was `` subjected to indignity and embarrassment at the airport '' , calling the government 's defiance of the Supreme Court order `` abhorrent and in violation of the rights of the individual guaranteed by the -LRB- Philippine 's -RRB- constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights . '' But presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda described the situation as `` all high drama , '' according to media reports . `` They -LRB- the Arroyos -RRB- want the public to sympathize with them , '' he added . He said that while the Arroyo couple would be treated with dignity , the government would be `` firm in our decision not to allow them to leave the country . '' Arroyo 's husband , Jose Miguel Arroyo , is also accused of corruption . The Supreme Court , which is mostly staffed by judges hired under Arroyo , defied current President Benigno Aquino 's stated mandate of investigating allegations of corruption during Arroyo 's 2001-2010 presidential term . Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the government intends to appeal the court 's decision . Lambino told CNN that even though the government plans to file a motion for reconsideration , its defiance of the Supreme Court order yesterday was nevertheless `` illegal .

672,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Queen Elizabeth and the royal family cost British taxpayers an average of 66 pence -LRB- $ 1.32 -RRB- per person last year , Buckingham Palace announced Friday in its annual report of royal finances . The Queen and the royal family cost Britons a little bit more in the latest financial year . The total cost of the queen and royal family was 40 million pounds -LRB- $ 80 million -RRB- in the past fiscal year , an increase of 2 percent from the year before , according to the Royal Public Finances report . The man in charge of managing the queen 's financial affairs said she has tried to keep costs down , pointing out that the queen 's expenses are more than 3 percent lower in real terms than they were in 2001 . `` The reduction in the amount of head of state expenditure in real terms reflects the continuous attention the royal household pays to obtaining the best value for money in all areas of expenditure , '' said Alan Reid , whose official title is `` keeper of the privy purse . '' Funding for property maintenance at the royal palaces increased by almost 1 million pounds -LRB- $ 2 million -RRB- from the year before to 15.3 million pounds -LRB- $ 30.6 million -RRB- , but it will stay at that level for the next three years , the palace said . Reid warned that the money is not enough to deal with a backlog of maintenance work . `` This backlog relates to essential maintenance and does not include any allowance for projects such as the redecoration of the state rooms at Buckingham Palace , most of which were last redecorated before the queen 's reign , '' he said . Available funds are also unlikely for replacing the lead and slate roofs at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle -LRB- which would cost an estimated 16 million pounds , or $ 32 million -RRB- ; replacing heating and electrical wiring and removing asbestos at the palace -LRB- 2.4 million pounds , or $ 4.8 million -RRB- ; and replacing Victorian cast iron and lead water mains at the castle -LRB- 3 million pounds , or $ 6 million -RRB- . Travel was a major expense for the queen and her family over the past year , the reports showed . The most expensive trip was the queen 's six-day state visit to the United States , which cost a total of 414,042 pounds -LRB- about $ 828,000 -RRB- . It cost 316,061 pounds -LRB- about $ 632,000 -RRB- for Prince Charles and his wife , Camilla , to take an eight-day trip to Uganda and Turkey in November for Britain 's Foreign Office . Prince Andrew , the Duke of York , also had a series of expensive trips as part of his role as the United Kingdom 's special representative for international trade and investment . He visited more than 20 countries in that capacity last year , trying to attract investors to Britain and helping British companies improve their prospects overseas . `` This report is provided every year to show transparency in the royal accounts , '' said CNN royal watcher Richard Quest . `` It is often used as an example to show profligacy , for instance with the cost of the royal train , which runs around 20,000 pounds -LRB- $ 40,000 -RRB- a day .

673,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of East Africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the UK in 1963 . Residents of the Mathare slum in Nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . But a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to The Economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . Tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in Kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . Last week 's election pitched incumbent President Mwai Kibaki , a member of Kenya 's largest Kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader Raila Odinga of the Luo tribe . The Kikuyu make up about 22 percent of Kenya 's population . Mostly originating from Kenya 's central highlands , the Kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . Kenya 's first post-independence leader , Jomo Kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a Kikuyu . Kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the Party of National Unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of Kenyatta 's successor , Daniel Arap Moi , a member of the Kalenjin tribe who ruled Kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . The Luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . But they also form a sizeable community in some of Nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast Kibera shantytown where Odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . Odinga 's Orange Democratic Movement is also backed by many members of the Luhya tribe , Kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after Odinga promised to make a leading Luhya his deputy if elected . This week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for Kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for Odinga in the closest presidential vote in Kenyan electoral history . But the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . Kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for Kenyan democracy . However , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . E-mail to a friend",what is tribe president Kibaki belongs to ?,Kenya 's largest Kikuyu
675,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Syrian arms dealer was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to sell weapons as part of a plot to kill Americans in Colombia , according to prosecutors . Syrian-born arms dealer Monzer al-Kassar , seen in a file photo , tried to sell weapons to undercover U.S. agents . Monzer al-Kassar was also ordered Tuesday to forfeit all of his assets , according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York . Al-Kassar 's co-defendant Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy received a 25-year prison sentence for his role in the conspiracy . Both men were convicted in November of five charges , including conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals , conspiracy to acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles , conspiracy to provide support for FARC guerrillas in Colombia , and money laundering . The federal indictment paints al-Kassar as an international arms dealer with a hand in conflicts in nearly every part of the world , with a web of bank accounts and front companies across Europe and the Middle East . Al-Kassar was arrested in Spain in 2007 on a U.S. warrant and his associate Moreno Godoy was arrested in Romania . Both were extradited to the United States . The arrests stemmed from an undercover sting operation involving U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posing as members of FARC . During the 16-month operation , the agents arranged to buy more than 12,000 weapons from the two men , according to the indictment . Al-Kassar agreed to provide surface-to-air missiles for the FARC to shoot down American helicopters , and also offered to send 1,000 men to fight with the FARC , plus explosives and men who could train the FARC in how to use them , the indictment charged . Al-Kassar demanded 3,500,000 euros -LRB- $ 4.4 million -RRB- as `` partial payment '' for the weapons , it said . Justice Department officials say al-Kassar has been a source of weapons and military equipment for armed combatants since the 1970s . Kassar had told journalists before he was arrested that he had retired from arms dealing , but the United States says he had been involved since the 1970s , providing weapons and military equipment to armed factions in Nicaragua , Cyprus , Bosnia , Croatia , Iran , Iraq , Somalia , and elsewhere .

Neither have I been martyred in a drone attack nor injured , '' the voice says on Saturday 's tape . Tariq , a Taliban spokesman , denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt . Tariq said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck . He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda . However , other Taliban and intelligence sources said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike . Tariq delivered both audiotapes to local journalists . On the tape released Friday , the voice says , `` The media right now is also part of the war . The enemy through the media wants to demoralize the Taliban . At times they spread the propaganda in the media that ` We have martyred Hakimullah . ' At other times they say , ` We have completed the operation in South Waziristan , ' but this will never happen . '' The drone strike hit a madrassa , or religious school , that local officials said had been converted into a militant training camp . Ten people were killed in the strike , Pakistani intelligence and local officials said . In the Friday tape , the speaker warns of what will happen if the drone strikes continue . `` I want to inform the Pakistani people that the drone attacks that take place in the tribal areas endanger the politics , well-being and sovereignty of Pakistan , '' the speaker says . `` From today onward , for any dangerous step that the Pakistani Taliban will take in Pakistan , those responsible will be Pakistan 's rulers , not the Taliban . This is because the Pakistani rulers want to spill the blood of the innocent -LSB- tribesmen -RSB- in exchange for dollars . '' The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones , or unmanned aircraft . The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft . Last week , the Taliban released a video showing Mehsud sitting next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi , the man who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at an eastern Afghan base December 30 . The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack . It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud 's predecessor , Baitullah Mehsud , who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year , according to al Qaeda 's commander of operations in Afghanistan , Mustafa Abu Yazid . Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe , but not from the same family . CNN 's Pierre Bairin contributed to this report .","according to the reports , Mehsud was injured because of what ?",suspected drone strike

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED . CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : I 'm Carl Azuz , and you 're tuned in to CNN Student News . Let 's go ! First Up : State of the Union AZUZ : `` He shall from time to time give to Congress information on the state of the union . '' The words of the U.S. Constitution and the reason why President Obama delivered his State of the Union address to Congress last night . A little background for you here : This speech has n't always been called the `` State of the Union . '' It used to be called the `` annual message . '' But the purpose has always been the same : for the president to talk about some of the biggest issues facing the country . That is why President Obama spent a good part of last night 's speech talking about the economy and the challenges facing the country . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : One year ago , I took office amid two wars , an economy rocked by a severe recession , a financial system on the verge of collapse , and a government deeply in debt . Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act , we might face a second depression . So we acted , immediately and aggressively . And one year later , the worst of the storm has passed . But the devastation remains . One in ten Americans still can not find work . Republican Response AZUZ : After the State of the Union , it 's traditional for the other party to offer its response to the president . Last night , the Republican response was given by newly-elected Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell . He won that election last year . McDonnell made his speech from the Virginia state House . He talked about some of the political issues that both parties agree on . But he also focused on some of the areas , especially when it comes to the economy , where Republicans and Democrats do n't see eye to eye . GOV. BOB MCDONNELL , -LRB- R -RRB- VIRGINIA : In the past year , more three million people have lost their jobs , yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt on our children and grandchildren . The amount of this debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in ten . The federal debt is already over $ 100,000 per household . This is simply unsustainable . The President 's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one .

Denise Stryker-Grant is getting stimulus money through a grant , but it 's not much ; $ 200,000 spread out over 3 years that will help keep people in their homes . But she says jobs , the only thing that would really help , remain elusive . DENISE STRYKER-GRANT , CLINTON COUNTY HOMELESS SHELTER : The frustration of continuing to refer them to places only to be told , you know , `` We 've got 500 resumes before you 've even walked in the door , '' and the frustration of them not having any opportunities . SNOW : To create opportunities , Wilmington 's mayor David Raizk applied for more than $ 61 million worth of stimulus projects . Of that , roughly $ 5 million has been awarded so far to a project to create jobs . It 's focused on Wilmington 's downtown and is set to start this spring . So , how do you see this benefiting from stimulus money ? DAVID RAIZK , WILMINGTON MAYOR : With the stimulus project , we 'll be able to improve our curbs and gutters and sidewalks SNOW : The hope , he says , is that improvements will attract businesses . In the immediate future , the project is estimated to create about 100 jobs . RAIZK : They 're going to be construction jobs , but it 's something , it 's something . We want jobs here of any type right now . SNOW : To get thousands of others back to work , the mayor has set his sights on Wilmington 's airpark and is hoping to redevelop it . Eight million dollars in stimulus money , he says , is being used to retrain workers , and he 's optimistic Washington will come through with more aid if the airpark comes back to life . RAIZK : I have tried to maintain a close relationship with our state partners and with our federal partners to say , `` Look , we need help and what can you do ? '' And they have responded , but that does n't mean they 've responded as much as I would like or anybody would like .

678,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A diabetes test that measures a person 's average blood glucose control over the preceding two to three months is being recommended as the new diagnostic tool for the condition . Diabetics have too much glucose in their blood when the condition is uncontrolled , and must monitor it . A committee of international experts recommended the test , called the the A1C assay , at the American Diabetes Association 's 69th Scientific Sessions over the weekend . The report could instigate a change in the way diabetes is diagnosed , the American Diabetes Association said . The A1C assay , which has been used for nearly 30 years to determine how well a patient controls diabetes , is a more stable , reliable diagnostic tool than the techniques currently in use , the authors of the report said . `` This committee that I chaired is recommending that this be used as widely as possible to diagnose diabetes instead of the blood sugar test , '' said Dr. David Nathan , director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and chairman of the committee . The A1C test , which consists of a simple blood test , is also more convenient than the two tests commonly used for diabetes -- the fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test -- the authors said . In the fasting test , the patient does not eat for about 12 to 14 hours before a blood test . In the tolerance test , the patient drinks a sweet solution and has blood drawn two hours later . In addition , Nathan said , `` It probably is better related to the development of eye disease with diabetes , and therefore probably serves as a better diagnostic tool . '' The international committee was assembled by the American Diabetes Association , International Diabetes Federation and European Association for the Study of Diabetes , but those organizations have not officially endorsed the report . `` Basically , the American Diabetes Association supports the concept , supports the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes , and just has to look at the implications of it , and the implementation of it , '' said Richard Kahn , Chief Scientific and Medical Officer for the American Diabetes Association , who was part of the committee . Using A1C in diagnosis would be particularly useful for determining whether patients have type 2 diabetes , which is more difficult to diagnose than type 1 , said Dr. William Bornstein , assistant professor of endocrinology at Emory University , who was not part of the committee . `` This will be beneficial to the population in terms of helping us more clearly diagnose folks who are at risks for complications and help them manage that earlier , '' Bornstein said . Still , controversy likely will arise over the use of the A1C in diagnostics because of the long , established track record of using the other two methods , Bornstein said . iReport.com : Boxing champ talks about diabetes struggle How it works Humans can not live without having sugar called glucose in their blood . Too much glucose , however , attaches to a variety of proteins in the body and harms them . Uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by too much glucose in the bloodstream . This excess glucose then glycates with -- or sticks to -- a protein called hemoglobin , which carries oxygen from the lungs to the body 's cells . The A1C test measures the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood , which is a reflection of average blood glucose control , according to the American Diabetes Association . A1C is a better measure of the problem that diabetes causes than glucose-based tests , at least for monitoring , said David Schoenfeld , professor of biostatistics at Harvard University . He and colleagues , including Nathan and a large group of international researchers , studied the relationship between A1C and average blood glucose . While many diabetics monitor their average blood glucose levels daily , at the doctor 's office the patient receives a measurement in terms of hemoglobin A1C , Schoenfeld said . He and researchers created a chart to convert these two measurements , so that patients would not have to interpret two different numbers and feel confused . They concluded in a 2008 paper that , for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes , A1C levels can be expressed as average glucose . The international committee concluded that an A1C level of 6.5 percent indicates that a person has diabetes , while values between 6 percent and 6.5 percent are likely to be at highest risk for developing diabetes . Experts note , however , that there is a continuum of risk for complications , and the `` cut-point '' of 6.5 percent should not be considered an absolute dividing line . All adults who are overweight and have additional risk factors , such as family history of diabetes , high blood pressure or abnormal lipid levels , should be screened for diabetes , according to the American Diabetes Association . Adults aged 45 or older should be tested even if they do not have these risk factors , the association said .",What is causing controversy ?,use of the A1C in diagnostics
679,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Terrell Owens , a former San Francisco 49er and a former Philadelphia Eagle , is now a former Dallas Cowboy . The Cowboys released Owens late Wednesday , according to published reports . The Dallas Cowboys have decided to part ways with wide receiver Terrell Owens , according to published reports . Questions surrounding the future of the controversial wide receiver have swirled since the Cowboys ' season ended with a 44-6 loss at Philadelphia that kept Dallas out of the playoffs . Owner Jerry Jones had said in recent weeks that he had not decided whether to keep or release Owens . In early February , Jones struck down an ESPN report that Jones ' son , Stephen , who is the team 's vice president , was lobbying his father to cut the wide receiver . Owens signed a three-year , $ 25 million contract with Dallas in March 2006 . He signed a new four-year , $ 34 million deal that included a $ 12 million signing bonus , in June 2008 . Owens finished the 2008 season 69 receptions for 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns . In Owens ' three seasons with the team , the Cowboys went 31-17 , but 0-2 in the playoffs . While Owens has produced solid numbers on the field , his career has been plagued with controversy . After Owens left the San Francisco 49ers in 2003 , he insinuated in an interview with Playboy magazine that his then-quarterback , Jeff Garcia , was homosexual . As a Philadelphia Eagle , Owens made headlines for coming back to play in Super Bowl XXX after suffering a severely sprained ankle and a fractured fibula weeks earlier . The following season , he voiced his displeasure with QB Donovan McNabb and Eagles management , which led to a four-game suspension without pay and his eventual deactivitation from the team . In September 2006 , police responded to Owens ' home after his publicist found the wide receiver unresponsive with an empty bottle of painkillers . Owens refuted reports that it was a suicide attempt and claimed a combination of painkillers and supplements made him groggy . This past season , Owens was reportedly jealous of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo 's relationship with tight end Jason Witten . According to published reports , Owens believed Romo and Witten held private meetings and created plays without including him . Published reports also said Owens had issues with Cowboys offensive coordinator Jason Garrett 's play-calling . -- CNN.com 's Kamal Wallace contributed to this report .",How much is the 4 year deal Terrell Owens signed worth ?,34 million
682,"Children and teens who have a parent with bipolar disorder are 14 times more likely than their peers to have bipolar-like symptoms themselves , and are two to three times more likely to be found to have an anxiety or mood disorder , such as depression , according to a report in the March issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry . More than 10 percent of the kids with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar-spectrum , mood or anxiety disorder . When both parents are bipolar , children are 3.6 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than children with only one parent with the psychiatric condition . Bipolar disorder , which is also known as manic-depressive illness , affects 5.7 million people over age 18 in the United States . The condition is characterized by extreme fluctuations in energy , mood , and the ability to function . For example , someone experiencing an `` episode '' may have a manic state of euphoria for a period of time , followed by a bout of severe depression . Although bipolar disorder may run in families , it 's not guaranteed that children of bipolar parents will develop the condition too . `` I do n't want parents to think ' I have bipolar , so my kids have bipolar , ' '' says Boris Birmaher , M.D. , of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and author of the new study , called the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study . `` Yes , these kids are at a higher risk , but that does n't necessarily mean your child will have it . '' Health.com : Bipolar disorder is different for women In the study , Birmaher and colleagues looked at 233 parents with bipolar disorder and their 388 children , ages 6 to 18 . They were compared with a control group of 143 parents and 251 children with no family history of the condition . Overall , 10.6 percent of the children with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar spectrum disorder -LRB- which includes a range of symptoms from severe to less so -RRB- or a mood or anxiety disorder . In comparison , only two children , or 0.8 percent , in the control group had such symptoms . It 's not clear whether genes , environment or a combination of both are responsible for the link , or possibly greater awareness and diagnosis of psychiatric conditions in bipolar families . Health.com : How a bipolar patient learned to manage mania However , Birmaher says identifying the condition at an earlier age may ultimately help young people . `` The longer you wait , the more complicated the condition could become , '' Birmaher says . Previous studies have suggested that it can take 10 years of symptoms before people get a correct diagnosis and proper treatment . `` Ten years is a long time -- especially in the life of a child , '' he says . The condition is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be mistaken for depression , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or one of the disruptive behavior disorders . Signs of a manic episode include increased energy , extreme irritability , racing thoughts , spending sprees , abuse of drugs -LRB- particularly cocaine -RRB- , and increased sexual drive . A depressive episode may range from disruptive sleeping patterns to thoughts of death or suicide . `` The chronic highs and lows are only two manifestations of the condition , '' says Gary Sachs , M.D. , director of the bipolar clinic and research program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . `` But there are plenty of people who live a full , functional life and still have bipolar disorder . '' Health.com : How to care for and cope with a bipolar spouse Bipolar disorder can not be cured , and is treated with mood-stabilizing medications like lithium , as well as psychotherapy , and psychosocial intervention . The ongoing study will follow this group of parents and children to explore further bipolar triggers including stress , family interactions , and genetics . Health.com : My story : I 'm bipolar and struggle with addiction `` This study in no way should be a reason for someone with bipolar not to have children , '' says Sachs . `` But there is a risk and that might make someone 's child who has difficulty seek help sooner . '' In adults with bipolar disorder , up to 60 percent say they had their first symptoms before the age of 21 . `` Bipolar disorder is a multidimensional condition , and it can affect a lot of things including your physical health , '' says Sachs . `` That is what we are learning from studies like this where you begin to see other psychiatric conditions . '' The National Institute of Mental Health funded the study .

684,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Texas man convicted of murdering a San Antonio police officer before turning his gun on his wife was put to death Thursday evening , soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his last-minute appeal . The time of death for Frank Martinez Garcia was 7:02 p.m. CT -LRB- 8:02 p.m. ET -RRB- , said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Becky Blanton . Garcia was 28 on March 29 , 2001 , when San Antonio police officer Hector Garza responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the home Garcia shared with his parents , his wife , Jessica , and their children . Garza , 49 , died first after being shot three times by Garcia , the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said on its website . Garcia 's wife died after he shot her six times . He also fired several shots at others outside the home , wounding his wife 's uncle , according to authorities . The couple 's 5-year-old daughter witnessed the murders , according to the Department of Criminal Justice . The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott stated , on its website , that Garcia -- who had been arrested with gang members in 1992 -- also fired his weapon at the vice principal of a nearby elementary school , hitting the front door of the school . Garcia eventually surrendered to police , later admitting in a formal written statement that he had intentionally killed both the police officer and his wife , according to the attorney general . A Bexar County grand jury indicted him in September 2001 for capital murder . During his trial , jurors saw photos from inside Garcia 's home showing him and his wife brandishing weapons . Prosecutors also noted that his wife Jessica sought help from a battered women 's shelter in 1994 , after alleging physical and emotional abuse , while her co-workers had seen marks and bruises on her . In February 2002 , Garcia was convicted and sentenced to death . The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction two years later . And in 2007 , the same court denied his application for habeas corpus relief -- in other words , claiming the state did n't have a right to hold him -- according to the attorney general . A U.S. district court turned down a similar petition in 2009 , and a U.S. Circuit of Appeals court rejected his appeal the following year . In March 2011 , the U.S. Supreme Court denied his writ of certiorari review , a legal term related to a higher court reviewing a lower court 's decision .

686,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Financial crisis-stricken Iceland formally applied for European Union membership on Friday , a day after lawmakers narrowly backed a government plan to take the island nation into the economic and political bloc . Icelandic PM Johanna Sigurdardottir pledged to take Iceland into the EU during April 's election campaign . A copy of the application was submitted to the Swedish government , which currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency , Iceland 's Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement . Iceland 's economy was devastated by the collapse of the island 's banking system last year , leading to the resignation of the country 's government . In elections in April , center left leader Johanna Sigurdardottir was elected prime minister after pledging to take Iceland into the EU . On Thursday , Iceland 's parliament , the Althing , voted in favor of the government plan by 33 votes to 28 with two abstentions . `` This is a historic day for Iceland , '' Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said in a statement . `` As a European nation already deeply integrated into European structures ... we now look forward to taking the next logical step , in close cooperation with our European partners . '' Welcoming Iceland 's application , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said : `` The decision of the Icelandic Parliament is a sign of the vitality of the European project and indicative of the hope that the European Union represents . Iceland is a European country with long and deep democratic roots . '' Iceland already benefits from a free trade arrangement with European Union member states , latterly as a participating member of the European Economic Area , which was established in 1994 , and formerly through a bilateral free trade agreement with the EEC , the EU 's predecessor . But Icelanders have traditionally been skeptical of the benefits of full EU membership , fearing that they would lose some of their independence as a small state within a larger political entity . At present three other states in southeastern Europe -- Croatia , FYR Macedonia and Turkey -- are candidate countries for EU membership . `` I am pleased that the EU 's enlargement agenda may soon extend to Europe 's north-western corner as well , with Iceland , a country with deep democratic traditions , in addition to our continued commitment to South East Europe , '' said Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn .",What did Iceland apply for ?,formally applied for European Union membership
687,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday morning in Oslo , Norway . A record number of nominations -- 241 -- were received by the Nobel committee this year . Of those , 53 are organizations , including WikiLeaks -- the website founded by Julian Assange that facilitates the publication of classified information . It made headlines for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and also released thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables . Among the individuals thought to be strong contenders are several involved in fomenting peaceful uprisings in the Arab world . They include Wael Ghonim , the former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt , Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni , who criticized the regime long before the uprisings began , dispersing information to the outside world , and Israa Abdel Fattah , who helped organize Egypt 's online April 6 Youth Movement in 2008 and played a role again in 2011 . Other favorites are Sima Samar , head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and a trailblazer for women 's rights in Afghanistan , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payas Sardinas and Ghazi bin Muhammad , a Jordanian advocate of interfaith dialogue . Another organization which could be in with a shot is Memorial , a Russian civil rights group known for its fight for to protect refugees and victims of political persecution and human rights violations in war zones . Apart from the winner , the names of the nominees can not be revealed by the Nobel committee for another 50 years .

688,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Homegrown terrorism will be part of the United States ' National Security Strategy for the first time , according to President Barack Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , who called it a new phase of the terrorist threat . When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy on Thursday , it will be the first time any president `` explicitly recognizes the threat to the United States posed by individuals radicalized here at home , '' National Security Adviser John Brennan said Wednesday . The strategy acts as a blueprint for how a White House administration intends to protect Americans . In the past , it has focused mostly on international threats . But a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document , Brennan said .

690,"Baghdad , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States plans to appeal a federal judge 's dismissal of charges against five Blackwater security guards accused of killing 17 people in Baghdad in 2007 , Vice President Joe Biden announced Saturday . Speaking at a joint appearance with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in Baghdad , Biden said he was `` disappointed '' with the ruling , and that the Justice Department would file the appeal next week . `` The United States is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people , '' Biden told reporters . The September 2007 shootout in Baghdad 's Nusoor Square left 17 Iraqis dead and two dozen wounded . The killings led Iraq 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater , now known as Xe , and other firms . An attorney representing one of the five defendants in the case said he was disappointed by Biden 's announcement in Iraq , saying it was motivated by `` political purposes '' as opposed to legal reasoning . `` This is not how the Justice Department announces its intentions in any case , '' said David Schertler , attorney for Dustin Heard . `` We had no idea that the vice president was going to announce a political decision . '' Last month , U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the government 's case was built largely on `` statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution , '' a violation of the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged . `` In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , '' Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision . Federal prosecutors `` repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case '' in doing so , he found . Urbina also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case , calling their explanations for using the guards ' statements `` all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility . '' `` In short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , '' he wrote . Schertler , Heard 's attorney , said Urbina 's `` reasoning is sound and will hold up in appeal . '' The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began . The company said its contractors came under attack , but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate . Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough , Evan Liberty , Dustin Heard , Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime . Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November , but Thursday 's ruling dismisses the counts against all five . `` We 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , '' Slough 's lawyer , Mark Hulkower , said at the time of the dismissal . A sixth guard , Jeremy Ridgeway , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been charged with DUI manslaughter Authorities charged Stallworth , 28 , with DUI manslaughter in the death of Mario Reyes , spokesman Ed Griffith said . Stallworth is expected to surrender in court Thursday , Griffith said . The charge is a bondable offense , and bail is expected to be set at $ 200,000 . If convicted , he could face up to 15 years in prison . According to Griffith , Stallworth 's blood-alcohol level after last month 's accident was measured at 0.126 percent , higher than the state 's legal limit of 0.08 percent . Stallworth was drinking at a Miami Beach , Florida , club early March 14 , court documents say . He later left the club and went to a Miami residence for about 45 minutes before leaving in his black Bentley GT at 7:07 a.m. . He was driving east on the MacArthur Causeway , which connects Miami to the South Beach area of Miami Beach , when he struck Reyes , prosecutors said . Reyes , a construction worker , was crossing the eastbound lanes of the causeway . CNN affiliate WSVN reported that he was heading to a bus stop after leaving work .

694,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. George Tiller , whose Kansas women 's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion , was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning , police said . Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians that performed late-term abortions . Wichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City , Kansas , area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller , who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions . The killing , which came about 16 years after Tiller survived a shooting outside his Wichita clinic , took place shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday at Reformation Lutheran Church . Officers found the 67-year-old dead in the foyer , police said . Witnesses provided a description of the car and a license number of the killer 's getaway vehicle , Wichita police spokesman Gordon Bassham said . Police stopped a blue Ford Taurus matching the description about three hours later in Gardner , about 30 miles southwest of Kansas City , and took the driver into custody . No charges had been filed Sunday evening and no motive for the killing was immediately known , but Wichita police Detective Tom Stoltz told reporters : `` We think we have the right person arrested . '' `` We will investigate this suspect to the Nth degree -- his history , his family , his associates -- and we are just in the beginning stages of that , '' Stoltz said . See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller 's murder '' Tiller 's slaying drew condemnation from supporters , from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama , who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek `` common ground '' on the issue of abortion . `` However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion , they can not be resolved by heinous acts of violence , '' Obama said in a statement issued by the White House . The shooting prompted U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to direct federal marshals to `` offer protection to other appropriate people and facilities around the nation , '' according to a statement from the Department of Justice . Tiller had been practicing medicine for nearly 40 years , said Peter Brownlie , president of the Kansas City-based regional Planned Parenthood office . His patients were `` almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy , '' and where a woman 's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued , Brownlie said . He and his staff had been picketed for years , with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood , Brownlie said . His clinic suffered serious damage from a bomb in the mid-1990s , and he was shot through both arms in 1993 by an anti-abortion activist who is currently serving time in federal prison . `` He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis , '' Brownlie said . `` As recently as early this month the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so . '' Watch Tiller describe the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 '' Tiller had armed security at his clinic and a `` pretty rigorous '' security procedure at home , Brownlie said . But he `` made an effort to live his life as normally as possible knowing he could be a target at any time , '' he said . In a statement issued through Tiller 's lawyers , his family -- a wife , four children and 10 grandchildren -- said their loss `` is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America . '' `` George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence , '' his family said in a written statement . `` We ask that he be remembered as a good husband , father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere . '' In March , Tiller was acquitted of 19 counts of performing procedures unlawfully at his clinic . In 2008 , a probe initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges . Leading anti-abortion groups condemned Sunday 's shooting , emphasizing they wanted to shut down Tiller 's practice by legal means . Operation Rescue , which has led numerous demonstrations at Tiller 's clinic , called the shooting as a `` cowardly act . '' And the National Right to Life Committee , the largest U.S. anti-abortion group , said it `` unequivocally condemns any such acts of violence regardless of motivation . '' `` The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life , '' it said . `` The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal . '' But Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry , who is no longer affiliated with the group , called Tiller `` a mass murderer . '' `` We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God , '' Terry said in a written statement . `` I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller 's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions . Abortion is still murder , and we still must call abortion by its proper name . '' The National Organization for Women , which supports abortion rights , called Tiller 's killing an act of `` domestic terrorism . '' And NARAL Pro-Choice America said Tiller had worked for years under `` intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence . '' If Tiller was killed because of his work , he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993 . See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 '' In 1998 , a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his Amherst , New York , home . Anti-abortion activist James Kopp was later arrested in France and is serving life in prison . In 1994 , Dr. John Bayard Britton and one of his volunteer escorts were shot and killed outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola , Florida . Paul Hill , a former minister , was convicted of the killings and executed in 2003 . And in 1993 , another doctor , David Gunn , was shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic . His killer , Michael Griffin , is serving a life sentence . In addition , a nurse at a Birmingham , Alabama , clinic was maimed and an off-duty police officer was killed in a 1998 bombing by Eric Rudolph , who included abortion among his list of anti-government grievances .

699,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The attackers who planted a car bomb outside a courthouse in Northern Ireland Monday night gave only 17 minutes warning before the explosion , the Police Service of Northern Ireland told CNN Tuesday . `` It is a miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured , '' PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott said . `` It is only thanks to a member of the public contacting us that we are not dealing with fatalities this morning . '' The car was packed with about 250 pounds -LRB- 113 kilograms -RRB- of explosives , police estimate . A local hospital in the town of Newry got a warning call at 10:20 p.m. local time -LRB- 7:20 p.m. ET -RRB- and a business was phoned two minutes later . The bomb went off at 10:37 p.m. , a police representative said . That `` is not enough time to evacuate a public area , '' a police representative said . British police spokesmen traditionally do not identify themselves by name . A member of the public reported a car being abandoned at about 10 p.m. , she said . That appears to have given police extra time to respond . Baggott blamed the attack on `` dissident republicans , '' pro-Irish militants who reject the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that sharply reduced violence in the province . They `` simply want to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of the past , '' Baggott said , condemning `` cowardly attacks '' by `` terrorists '' who `` want to destroy all that is good about Northern Ireland and have no place in a modern civilized society . '' `` This is not an attack on a court building , this is an attack on people whose lives depend on the well-being of Newry , '' he added . `` This is an attack that broke and damaged places of worship ... damaged the ability of Newry to be at the heart of our economic success . '' Newry is about 35 miles -LRB- 56 kilometers -RRB- south of the provincial capital , Belfast . Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's office `` strongly condemned '' the bombing , saying Tuesday it was the work of a `` tiny minority . '' The `` attack '' is `` entirely unrepresentative of the views of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland , '' said a statement from Brown 's Downing Street office . The court building was badly damaged and businesses in the area were evacuated , police said . Northern Ireland was wracked for decades by violence between pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans . About 3,000 people died in the `` Troubles , '' as the violence was known , before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out in 1998 . There has been sporadic violence since then . A booby-trapped car exploded on January 8 , severely injuring Constable Peadar Heffron . A car bomb partly exploded outside the headquarters of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland on November 21 , and another under-car booby trap exploded on October 22 in east Belfast , injuring a woman , the PSNI said . Two soldiers and a policeman were shot dead in separate attacks in March 2009 . The two biggest parties in the province , the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the pro-Irish Sinn Fein , reached a deal earlier this month to bring police powers under local control , averting a crisis that had threatened to force new elections .",How many died before the 1998 peace agreement ?,"About 3,000 people"
700,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Nestle plant linked to an outbreak of illness has been shut temporarily , and the company said Monday that it expects to lay off more than 200 workers as a result . Preliminary results `` indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , '' the CDC says . `` It 's likely that we 're going to have some temporary layoffs at that facility , '' Nestle spokeswoman Roz O'Hearn said of the Danville , Virginia , facility that was churning out refrigerated cookie-dough products until Thursday . About 550 people work at the factory , but only about half of them work on cookie dough , she said . The rest work on Buitoni pasta and sauce in a separate facility at the plant . She said there is little chance that the Buitoni products might be tainted , because -- even if the cookie dough is proved to be the source of the outbreak of E. coli 0157 : H7 -- it is a kosher product , meaning it is made from a segregated stream of ingredients . Danville 's Economic Development Office said the city 's unemployment rate is 14.3 percent . Nestle was first alerted to the problem late Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration , O'Hearn said , adding : `` Less than a day later , we made the decision to remove the product . We shut down . We stopped shipping . '' Included in the recall are 300,000 cases of the product . Each case contains 12 packages , and each package contains 24 cookies . That 's a total of 86.4 million cookies ' worth of dough . The recall does not include Dreyer 's or Edy 's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House `` cookie dough '' ingredients . That 's because the `` dough '' in ice cream is not really dough at all ; it is cooked . `` Ice cream is a different formulation , '' O'Hearn said . `` Since it 's not meant to be baked before consumption -- those cookie crumbles that are in the formulation -- they 're all cooked . For the cookie dough that 's present in the ice cream , Dreyer 's is using heat-treated ingredients . '' According to the CDC , between March 1 and Monday , 70 people in 30 states had been infected with a strain of E. coli . The ages of the people affected ranged from 2 to 57 years , though more than 70 percent were younger than 19 , and 75 percent were female , the agency said on its Web site . Twenty-five people had been hospitalized , and seven had developed a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome . No fatalities had been reported , it said . `` Preliminary results of this investigation indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , '' the agency said . `` Most patients reported eating refrigerated prepackaged Nestle Toll House cookie dough products raw . '' Though cooking the product would kill the bacteria , the agency did not recommend that people holding on to the company 's cookie-dough products do so , `` because consumers might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces .

702,"MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A mother and her teenage son are kidnapped . The kidnappers place a cell phone in the car of the boy 's father so they can communicate their ransom demands . The son is burned with a blowtorch . The mother implores the father to pay the ransom . A terrifying scenario , but one that the FBI and police say was all orchestrated by the mother to get some fast cash from her ex-husband . The mother , Alejandra Arriaza , her boyfriend , Angel Ponce , and his nephew , Joel Boza , were charged Tuesday with federal kidnapping counts . If convicted , they could be sentenced to life in prison . According to an FBI affidavit , all three have admitted their roles in the phony kidnapping . `` We took it very seriously and believed a couple of lives were at risk , '' said Jim Leljedal of the Broward County , Florida , sheriff 's office . `` And then to find out that one of the victims was involved in the plot was pretty surprising . '' The three suspects will have a detention hearing Wednesday in a federal court in Miami , Florida . The U.S. attorney 's office would not comment on the case . According to the FBI affidavit , written by special agent Scott Wilson , the plot was Arriaza 's idea . It began , court papers say , when she and her boyfriend found out her ex-husband had recently come into some money from the sale of a business , and that he kept a large amount of cash in his home . The father and son are not named in the affidavit , which refers to the father as `` H.P. '' and to his 17-year-old son as `` N.P. '' The affidavit says that the plot began Thursday when Arriaza told her son she wanted to take him to Wal-Mart to purchase an Apple iPhone . When they got back to their car , a masked intruder appeared from the back seat , pointed a gun at the son 's back and told him and his mother that they were being kidnapped , according to the affidavit . The kidnapper placed thick tape over the son 's eyes and instructed his mother to drive to a mobile home in southwest Miami , where a second person , who introduced himself as `` El Negro , '' was waiting . The affidavit says the men forced N.P. to sit in a chair , where they bound his hands . His torso was bound to the back of the chair with shrink wrap , and his legs were bound with tape . The boy 's head was wrapped in thick tape from the top to the tip of his nose , and he was put in a closet , where he spent the night . The next day , according to the FBI affidavit , the kidnappers called the boy 's father on a cell phone they had placed in his car . The father then called authorities , who began to record the phone calls . At one point during the abduction , the son told the kidnappers that his father had about $ 50,000 in a bank , the affidavit says . When the kidnappers felt that the father was not complying with their demands , they threatened to burn his son , and at one point , according to the affidavit , `` the kidnappers put a lit blowtorch close to the phone , so he could hear it . '' During another phone call , Arriaza , who is the father 's ex-wife , told him that kidnappers were burning their son 's feet . She implored him to pay the kidnappers their ransom , the affidavit says . At one point , Wilson wrote , the kidnappers held the blowtorch so close to N.P. `` that it burnt the hair off his leg . '' `` I think they wanted to impress him with the seriousness so that he would relay ... to his father to come up with some money , '' Leljedal said . Under the FBI 's guidance , the father arranged to pay the ransom . But late in the evening of April 10 , before the ransom was paid , law enforcement located the mobile home and rescued the son , who immediately identified his mother 's boyfriend , Angel Ponce , as one of the men inside the unit where he was being held . A search of the home turned up a fake gun , a blowtorch , tape and three cell phones . According to the affidavit , Ponce said Arriaza came up with the idea to have herself kidnapped , along with her son , to get money from her ex-husband . Arriaza later admitted her involvement in the kidnapping and said her son had no involvement in the ruse , according to the FBI . `` We do n't think she meant to harm to her son . She just wanted to collect from her ex , '' Leljedal said . In the end , he said , it was all about one thing : `` The basic motive of greed . ''",What was the teenager bound with ?,shrink wrap

Henry Waxman , D-California , said the bill is intended to repair a `` dysfunctional '' health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance . `` We are going to accomplish what many people felt would n't happen in our lifetime , '' he said . But House Republicans slammed the Democrats ' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three House committees begin considering the legislation later this week . Rep. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri , said the bill `` without any question will kill jobs , will limit access to health care , will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care . '' Blunt said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials , including Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , to enroll in the new public insurance option . Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats also question the cost of health care reform . An earlier draft of the House Democrats ' bill carried a price tag of $ 1 trillion over 10 years . The Congressional Budget Office said the revised house bill also would cost $ 1 trillion . However , a senior Democratic House committee staffer said the CBO analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost-saving measures worth $ 500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy Americans , estimated to raise more than $ 500 billion over a decade . According to the CBO , the bill would cover 97 percent of Americans by 2015 . The bill includes tax surcharges on Americans in the top 1.2 percent of income . It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $ 1 million , a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million , and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $ 350,000 or individual income over $ 280,000 . Anticipating Republican complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal , Democratic sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners . Specific provisions of the bill include : -- A Health Insurance Exchange providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage , including a government-funded public option . -- No more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions . -- Affordability credits for low - and moderate-income individuals and families , available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 43,000 for individuals and $ 88,000 for a family of four . -- Limits on annual out-of-pocket spending . -- Expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level . -- Required participation by individuals , with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance . -- Requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $ 250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf . -- A series of measures intended to reduce costs of Medicaid , Medicare and other existing systems . A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups opposed some of the bill 's proposals , calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses . `` Exempting some micro-businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs , '' the statement said . The House bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber . The Senate also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the House bill provisions . Obama has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before Congress goes on its August recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year . House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia argued that the current economic conditions mean Congress should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system . `` There 's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of , really , millions of jobs , '' Cantor said Tuesday . A CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support Obama 's health care plans , but most worry that their costs would go up , and only one in five think their families would be better off .

706,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home , a medical examiner said Tuesday . Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his family in June . Dr. Kris Sperry , Georgia 's chief medical examiner , said the body of Benoit 's wife , Nancy , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs . Sperry said it 's likely the Benoits ' 7-year-old son , Daniel , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy 's system . Xanax is not normally prescribed for children , Sperry said . Chris Benoit 's body contained an `` elevated '' level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , Sperry said . But , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death . `` There 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , '' Sperry said . `` The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , '' he said . `` It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency . '' The investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in Benoit 's body . The investigation into the Benoits ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called '' ` roid rage , '' leading him to kill his wife and son . An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy . The Orlando , Florida , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids . Phil Astin , Benoit 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs . Astin has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest . Although Benoit 's name was not mentioned in Astin 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths . `` Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville , Georgia , Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4 , 2006 , through May 9 , 2007 , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone . Nancy Benoit 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body `` could come from the decomposition process . '' Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel 's body . Daniel 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but Sperry could not speculate why . District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths , which he said is ongoing . `` We 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , '' he said . `` We 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household . This -LRB- the toxicology report -RRB- adds one element to all the other elements . '' Police have said Benoit , 40 , strangled his wife , Nancy , and suffocated Daniel , then placed Bibles next to their bodies before hanging himself on a portable weight machine over the weekend of June 23 .

714,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and other top Democrats are heading back to school Tuesday , in hopes of convincing first-time voters from the 2008 election to vote again in 2010 . The president is scheduled to headline a Democratic party rally at the University of Wisconsin in Madison while the vice president is the main attraction at a similar event at Pennsylvania State University in State College , Pennsylvania . The idea is to fire up `` surge '' voters and motivate them to go to the polls again in this November 's midterm elections . According to national exit polls from 2008 , 11 percent of people who cast ballots in the presidential contest said they were first time voters , and seven out of 10 of those new voters said they backed Obama in the election . Many of those people were young voters , and exit polls indicated that two-thirds of people age 18-29 voted for Obama . In advance to Tuesday 's rallies , the president held a conference call with college and university journalists . `` You ca n't sit it out . You ca n't suddenly just check in once every 10 years or so , on an exciting presidential election , and then not pay attention during big mid-term elections where we 've got a real big choice between Democrats and Republicans , '' Obama said . There 's no mistake in the locations for the Obama and Biden rallies . In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , the Democrats face tough odds in holding onto open Senate seats and governorships . Polls also indicate that Republicans have a good chance of grabbing back a bunch of House seats . Also on the road Tuesday : Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine , at a rally at the University of Delaware in Newark , Delaware ; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the University of Maryland in College Park , Maryland ; Labor Secretary Hilda Solis at California State University in Los Angeles ; and United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk at North Carolina Central University in Durham , North Carolina .

720,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mumia Abu-Jamal sits on Pennsylvania 's death row , perhaps the most recognized of the 228 condemned inmates at the Greene Correctional Facility , an hour south of Pittsburgh . Former radio host and convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal during a 1994 interview Abu-Jamal , inmate AM8335 , awaits three milestones . His new book , `` Jailhouse Lawyers , '' will be released next month . He 's also awaiting a pair of Supreme Court decisions , which could come in the next two weeks . The former Black Panther was sentenced to die for gunning down a Philadelphia police officer 28 years ago . The high court will decide whether he deserves a new hearing to determine whether his execution should go forward . The state is appealing a federal appeals court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu-Jamal 's favor last year . The case has attracted international attention . Abu-Jamal 's lawyers filed a separate appeal claiming that racism led to his 1982 conviction . That petition is scheduled for consideration by the Supreme Court on April 3 . If either case is accepted by the justices for review , oral arguments would be held in the fall . The former radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial . Others counter that Abu-Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions . They say he has divided the community for years with his provocative writing and activism . He was convicted for the December 9 , 1981 , murder of officer Daniel Faulkner , 25 , in Philadelphia . Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal 's brother in a late-night traffic stop . Witnesses said Abu-Jamal , who was nearby , ran over and shot the police officer in the back and in the head . Abu-Jamal , once known as Wesley Cook , was also wounded in the confrontation and later admitted to the killing , according to other witnesses ' testimony . Abu-Jamal is black , and the police officer was white . Incarcerated for nearly three decades , Abu-Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system . On a Web site created by friends to promote his release , the prisoner-turned-author writes about his fight . `` This is the story of law learned , not in the ivory towers of multi-billion dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave-ship , in the hidden , dank dungeons of America . '' His chief defense attorney , Robert Bryan , has filed appeals asking for a new criminal trial . `` The central issue in this case is racism in jury selection , '' he wrote to supporters last month . `` We are in an epic struggle in which his life hangs in the balance . What occurs now in the Supreme Court will determine whether Mumia will have a new jury trial or die at the hands of the executioner , '' Bryan said . Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced him to death . A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals kept the murder conviction in place a year ago but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing . `` The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , '' Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica wrote in the 77-page opinion . The federal appeals court ultimately concluded that the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh `` mitigating factors '' offered by the defense that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row . Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance , such as the fact that Abu-Jamal had no prior criminal record . Months before that ruling , oral arguments on the issue were contentious . Faulkner 's widow and Abu-Jamal 's brother attended , and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia . If the Supreme Court refuses now to intervene on the sentencing issue , the city 's prosecutor would have to decide within six months whether to conduct a new death penalty sentencing hearing or allow Abu-Jamal to spend the rest of his life in state prison . Many prominent groups and individuals , including singer Harry Belafonte , the NAACP and the European Parliament , are cited on his Web site as supporters . Prosecutors have insisted that Abu-Jamal pay the price for his crimes and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row for Faulkner 's murder . `` This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu-Jamal is some kind of a folk hero , '' Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said last year , when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction . `` He is nothing short of an assassin . '' The city has honored the fallen police officer with a street designation and a commemorative plaque placed at the spot where he was shot and killed . The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , wrote a book two years ago about her husband and the case : `` Murdered by Mumia : A Life Sentence of Loss , Pain and Injustice . '' She writes that she was trying to `` definitively lay out the case against Mumia Abu-Jamal and those who 've elevated him to the status of political prisoner .

722,"The Hague , Netherlands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic 's failure to appear at the start of his trial on genocide and war crimes charges CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson explains what happens next . Q : How does the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia -LRB- ICTY -RRB- differ from the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- ? A : The ICTY was set up by the United Nations in 1993 specifically to try people for crimes committed during the break up of the former Yugoslavia . The ICC is the first permanent , treaty-based , international criminal court established to prosecute the most serious crimes of concern to the global community including genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . Q : Why did Karadzic fail to show up in court on Monday ? A : Karadzic failed to show up because he wrote to the court several weeks ago telling judges he had not had sufficient time to prepare his defense . He is a `` self-representing accused , '' meaning he is defending himself . But he is backed by a large number of lawyers supported by a bevy of interns from U.S. law schools . Despite all this legal support , Karadzic says there has been too much evidence for him to go through . Prosecutors say they have 490 hours of evidence to present . The judge wrote back to Karadzic last week telling him he does n't need to present his defense yet , he can do it after the prosecution . But Karadzic still refused to show . The court can not compel him to come even though he is held in a detention facility about seven minutes drive from the court run exclusively for those awaiting or on trial at the tribunal . The detention facility is a lot more comfortable than a conventional jail . Karadzic will be able to watch TV when he wants , he has access to books and can mix with other defendants . Indeed , detention facility staff report that members of all three ethnic groups -- Serbs , Croats and Bosnians -- mingle freely , even playing games together . Q : Can the trial proceed without a defendant in the dock ? A : The trial can go ahead without Karadzic present because there is no legal reason that says he needs to be there , even though he is defending himself . But the court is bound to give him a fair trial so if the prosecution begins without him the judges may give Karadzic a video feed so he can watch proceedings unfold . Q : How long is the trial expected to last ? A : The trial could last at least two years and possibly three . The court allows at least one year for the prosecution and one year for the defense as a minimum . Q : What measures have been put in place to prevent a repeat of the delays and obfuscation seen during the trial of the former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic ? A : Milosovic 's trial dragged on because he defended himself , refused to accept the legitimacy of court and because of the complexity of the case and lengthy charge list -- 66 counts -- against him . Karadzic 's case is less complex and this is one of the lessons prosecutors have learned from the Milosevic trial : make cases simpler and only go for those that can be readily proved . But with Karadzic defending himself and refusing to accept the court 's legitimacy , the judges are still struggling to figure out how to deal with tactics designed to delay the trial . They are likely to be less lenient than they were with Milosevic .",What can the court not compel ?,him to come
726,"United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Delegates from the United States and other nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a fiery speech that criticized Washington , capitalism and the world body itself . Though incendiary statements from Ahmadinejad are nothing new , tension in the hall grew as the Iranian leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on New York and Washington . `` Some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack , '' Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly . He followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing `` the declining American economy and its scripts on the Middle East in order to save the Zionist regime . The majority of the American people , as well as most nations and politicians around the world , agree with this view . '' That appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats . Representatives from the United States , Britain , Sweden , Australia , Belgium , Uruguay and Spain walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that U.S. government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq . President Barack Obama already had delivered his address to the General Assembly and had left the grounds before Ahmadinejad spoke . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president `` found the comments to be outrageous and offensive , given how close we are to ground zero , '' the New York site of the attacks . And Mark Kornblau , a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the U.N. , said in a statement , `` Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people , Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable .

The exits did not deter the Iranian leader from his line of attack , however . Ahmadinejad went on to compare the death toll in the September 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in Afghanistan in Iraq . `` It was said that some 3,000 people were killed on September 11th , for which we are all very saddened , '' he said . `` Yet , up until now in Afghanistan and Iraq , hundreds of thousands of people have been killed , millions wounded and displaced , and the conflict is still going on and expanding .

727,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After spending nearly 28 years in an irreversible coma , heiress and socialite Martha `` Sunny '' von Bulow died Saturday in a New York nursing home , according to a family statement . She was 76 . Sunny von Bulow is pictured during her 1957 wedding to Prince Alfred von Auersperg . Von Bulow was subject of one of the nation 's most sensational criminal cases during the 1980s . Her husband , Claus , was accused of trying to kill her with an overdose of insulin , which prosecutors alleged sent her into the coma . He was convicted of making two attempts on her life , but the conviction was overturned on appeal . He was acquitted in a second trial . His retrial in 1985 received national attention . `` We were blessed to have an extraordinarily loving and caring mother , '' said the statement from Von Bulow 's three children -- Annie Laurie `` Ala '' Isham , Alexander von Auersperg and Cosima Pavoncelli -- released by a spokeswoman . `` She was especially devoted to her many friends and family members . '' Martha von Bulow was born Martha Sharp Crawford into a wealthy family . She inherited a fortune conservatively estimated at $ 75 million , according to an article on the von Bulow case posted on truTV.com 's Crime Library Web site . In her early years , she drew comparisons to actress Grace Kelly . She became known as Princess von Auersperg with her first marriage , to Prince Alfred von Auersperg of Austria . That marriage produced two children : Alexander and Annie Laurie . The von Bulows married in 1966 and had a daughter , Cosima . On the morning of December 22 , 1980 , family members found Martha von Bulow unconscious in the bathroom of the family 's posh Newport , Rhode Island , home . She never regained consciousness . She had been hospitalized a year earlier after lapsing into a coma but recovered , according to the Crime Library site . Doctors had diagnosed her with hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar . Prosecutors accused Claus von Bulow of twice attempting to kill his wife by injecting her with insulin . The case also led to a major motion picture , `` Reversal of Fortune . '' Actor Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow . Famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz , who won Claus von Bulow a new trial on appeal after his conviction , said in a statement Saturday that Martha von Bulow 's death is `` a sad ending to a sad tragedy that some members of her family tried to turn into a crime . We proved overwhelming -LSB- ly -RSB- that there was no crime and that the coma was self-induced . We saved his life , but could not save hers . '' Claus von Bulow 's defense team maintained that Martha von Bulow 's alcohol use , among other factors , caused her coma . Dershowitz said he had spoken with Claus von Bulow , who now lives in London , England . Claus von Bulow was saddened by his former wife 's passing , Dershowitz said . The family statement said Martha von Bulow is survived by her children , their spouses and nine grandchildren . Alexander von Auersperg and Ala von Auersperg Isham , who had sided with prosecutors against Claus von Bulow , filed a civil suit against their stepfather after his acquittal . The case was settled out of court in 1987 , according to a 2007 article in the Providence Journal newspaper in Rhode Island . Claus von Bulow had agreed to waive his claim to his wife 's money and to a divorce in exchange for the suit being dropped . The von Bulows ' daughter , Cosima , sided with her father . Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne , who covered the von Bulow case , told the New York Daily News in 2007 that Sunny von Bulow was moved from Columbia Presbyterian hospital to a private nursing home in 1998 .

728,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a second vaccine intended to protect against cervical cancer . GlaxoSmithKline has manufactured a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer . Cervarix , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline , was approved Friday for prevention of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus -LRB- HPV -RRB- types 16 and 18 . The vaccine is approved for use in girls and women ages 10 to 25 years and is to be administered in three doses . After the initial shot , the second and third doses are to be given within six months . `` The licensure of Cervarix adds another option in the prevention of cervical cancer , '' said Dr. Karen Midthun , acting director of the FDA 's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research . `` It has the potential to save lives from cervical cancer as well as reduce the need for biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the necessary follow-up from abnormal Pap tests . '' According to GlaxoSmithKline , the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions , regardless of HPV type . `` The vaccine contains two HPV types -LRB- 16 & 18 -RRB- responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in North America , '' said Sarah Alspach , a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman . `` But approximately 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by other cancer-causing HPV types . Cervarix has been shown to reduce the incidence of pre-cancers resulting from cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18 . '' The vaccine will be available this year , according to GSK , which did not divulge the price . Cervarix will be competing with Merck & Company 's Gardasil , the first cervical cancer vaccine , which won FDA approval in June 2006 . Gardasil , for girls and women ages 9 to 26 , prevents against cervical , vulvar and vaginal cancers and protects against HPV types 11 , 16 and 18 . Gardasil 's approval has been broadened by the FDA to include an indication for boys and young men ages 9 through 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11 . `` This vaccine is the first preventive therapy against genital warts in boys and men ages 9 through 26 , and , as a result , fewer men will need to undergo treatment for genital warts . '' Midthun said . According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention , HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the nation . More than 40 types of HPV can infect genital areas , according to the disease agency . But because many of them are not visible to the naked eye , most people who become infected do n't know it .",what does GlaxoSmithKline says about Cervarix ?,"the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions , regardless of HPV type"
730,"PALO ALTO , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize helps underscore the urgency of the climate crisis , said former Vice President Al Gore on Friday . `` This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now , '' said Al Gore . Gore 's comments came hours after the Nobel committee announced he would share the award with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their work to raise awareness about global warming . `` This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now , '' Gore said , speaking to reporters in Palo Alto , California . `` It truly is a planetary emergency , and we have to respond quickly . '' The former vice president said he would donate his half of the $ 1.5 million prize to the Alliance for Climate Protection , an organization he founded to persuade people to reduce global warming by cutting pollution . `` That amount is very small compared to the enormous challenge that lies ahead , '' Gore said , including organizing a massive grass-roots movement and a mass advertising campaign focused on `` trying to change the way people think . '' Watch Gore describe what he calls a ` planetary emergency ' '' Earlier Friday , a White House spokesman said President Bush was pleased that Gore , Bush 's opponent in the 2000 presidential race , had won the award . `` Of course , he 's happy for Vice President Gore , happy for the International Panel on Climate Change scientists , who also shared the Peace Prize , '' White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said . `` Obviously it 's an important recognition , and we 're sure the vice president is thrilled . '' Fratto said Bush would not be under any pressure to adopt mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions , a policy Gore has advocated . Gore 's ex-boss , former President Clinton , also said he 's `` thrilled by this well-deserved recognition , '' and credited Gore with `` warning and educating us about the dangers of climate change for decades . He saw this coming before others in public life . '' The Nobel committee 's announcement cited Gore and the IPCC `` for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change , and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change . '' The award ceremony will be held December 10 in Oslo , Norway . In recent weeks , Gore has been the target of a campaign to persuade him to enter the 2008 presidential race . A source involved in Gore 's past political runs told CNN that he definitely has the ambition to use the peace prize as a springboard to run for president . But he will not run , because he wo n't take on the political machine assembled by Sen. Hillary Clinton , said the source . If the senator from New York had faltered at all , Gore would take a serious look at entering the race , the source said . But Gore has calculated that Clinton is unstoppable , according to the source . Gore repeatedly denied he has any plans to run again , but this week a group of grass-roots Democrats calling themselves `` Draft Gore '' took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in a bid to change his mind . Watch Gore discuss global warming and politics `` Your country needs you now , as do your party , and the planet you are fighting so hard to save , '' the group said in an open letter . `` America and the Earth need a hero right now , someone who will transcend politics as usual and bring real hope to our country and to the world . '' The Nobel committee praised Gore as being `` one of the world 's leading environmentalist politicians . '' `` He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted , '' said Ole Danbolt Mjos , chairman of the Nobel committee . In making the announcement , Mjos said , `` Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades , the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming . `` Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming . '' Said Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the U.N. panel : `` This is an honor that goes to all the scientists and authors who have contributed to the work of the IPCC . '' Renate Christ , secretary of the panel , called the award `` the most significant recognition that the IPCC has received . '' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988 to study climate change information . The group does n't do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world . The U.N.-sanctioned group was formed by the World Meteorological Organization and U.N. Environment Program . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was `` delighted '' with the news that Gore and the IPCC will share in prize . The Nobel caps a series of prestigious awards associated with Gore , including two Oscars this year for the 2006 documentary film , `` An Inconvenient Truth , '' which followed him on a worldwide tour publicizing the dangers of climate change . Last month , he also picked up an Emmy -- the highest award in U.S. television -- for `` Current TV . '' The show , which Gore co-created , describes itself as a global television network giving viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming . Previous American recipients of the peace prize include former Presidents Carter in 2002 , Wilson in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 . In 1973 , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the award with North Vietnam 's Le Duc Tho . The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. received the honor in 1964 .

731,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal health officials are expanding efforts to ensure no additional bacteria-tainted cantaloupes get to consumers in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness in more than a decade . The Food and Drug Administration said it has teamed up with state officials in the effort . `` FDA and its state partners are conducting checks at retail stores , wholesalers and distributors to make sure they have received notification about the Jensen Farms ' whole cantaloupe recall and that they have taken appropriate action to notify their customers and remove the recalled whole cantaloupes from the shelves , '' the agency said in a statement Wednesday . Thirteen people have died in what has become the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 , according to records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12 . It was traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms ' fields in Granada , Colorado . What you need to know about Listeria As of Monday , it had grown to 18 states , 72 illnesses and 13 deaths , according to the CDC 's latest statistics . `` Because some of the wholesalers and distributors may have further distributed the recalled cantaloupes to food processors , it is possible that additional products that contain cantaloupe from Jensen Farms could be recalled , '' the FDA said . `` There is no indication of foreign distribution at this time . '' In 1998 , 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs , according to a CDC database . Food poisoning 101 In the current outbreak , four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in New Mexico , two each in Colorado and Texas , and one each in Kansas , Maryland , Missouri , Nebraska , and Oklahoma . Public health officials also have reported illnesses in California , Florida , Illinois , Indiana , Montana , North Dakota , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wyoming . Listeria can grow even at low temperatures and can also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick , so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks , officials said . Listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms . It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults , according to the CDC , but it is particularly dangerous for older adults , people with weakened immune systems . In pregnant women , it can cause miscarriages , stillbirth and premature delivery . Pregnant women may experience only mild flu-like symptoms , said Dr. David Acheson , a former chief medical officer for the FDA who is now the managing director for food and import safety practice at Leavitt Partners , a firm which advises clients on health care and food safety . Listeria can be devastating to a fetus , he said , particularly in the second or third trimesters , so pregnant women who may have been exposed and have any flu-like symptoms should see a doctor . Symptoms can be more pronounced in the elderly or those with compromised immune systems , he said . About 1,600 people become seriously ill because of the bacteria each year , the CDC reports , and about 260 die .

734,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For years , Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants , officials say . On Thursday , Bout and his associate , Andrew Smulian , were arrested in Thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel . The men 's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries , including two undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration posing as Colombian rebels . Bout and Smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to Colombian rebels , said Michael Garcia , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York . In a complaint filed by a DEA agent , they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC . The U.S. Department of State designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003 . `` This marks the end of the reign of one of the world 's most-wanted arms traffickers , '' Garcia said of Bout . `` Someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday , and I can tell you that it will read like the very best work of Tom Clancy , only in this case , it wo n't be fiction , '' said Michael Braun , assistant administrator and chief of operations for the DEA . Secret meetings The operation began in January , when Smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent FARC but who were actually confidential sources working for the DEA . The men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons . At meetings in the Netherlands Antilles , Denmark and Romania , Smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents . At one meeting , the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about Bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers . Smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into Colombia , and he told the men that it would cost $ 5 million to transport the weapons . During one meeting , Smulian introduced the DEA sources to Bout over the phone . After that conversation , Smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in Bulgaria . Smulian and Bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal , and that is what happened Thursday . The arrests were made Thursday afternoon . The charges against Bout and Smulian cover the period from November through February , according to a written statement from the U.S. attorney 's office and the DEA . The United States plans to pursue the extradition of Bout from Thailand , the statement said . There was no mention of Smulian 's fate . Bout and Smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . If convicted , each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison , the statement said . ` I 'm not a diamond guy ' Intelligence agencies around the world have tracked Bout for years . Although some of his work has been legitimate , most has not . He has made deliveries to Africa , Asia and the Mideast using obsolete or surplus Soviet-era cargo planes . Bout , a former Soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages , has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of Soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world , according to U.S. officials . He acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union , the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in 2005 . At that time , the U.S. Treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of Bout and his associates , who are all tied to former Liberian President Charles Taylor . Taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the Special Court for Sierra Leone . Intelligence officials said Bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across Africa and Asia , often taking diamonds in payment from West African fighters . A 2006 article in Foreign Policy magazine said that although Bout served many third-world leaders , he also aided organizations such as the United Nations . `` He made countless trips for the United Nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place , '' the article charged . It said Bout probably committed multiple violations of U.N. arms embargoes . British intelligence officials found evidence in Afghanistan that Bout had shipped arms to the Taliban and al Qaeda , as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into Iraq . And the U.S. government said it received information that Bout profited $ 50 million from supplying the Taliban with military equipment when they ruled Afghanistan . Bout , who is said to be the inspiration for Nicolas Cage 's arms dealer character in the movie `` Lord of War , '' told CNN in 2002 that he never sold arms to the Taliban or al Qaeda . He also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to Iraq . Bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to Africa and to Afghanistan since 1992 . He denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in `` blood diamonds '' from Africa . `` It 's a lie , '' he said . `` I never touched diamonds in my life , and I 'm not a diamond guy , and I do n't want to go into that business . '' Some reports at the time claimed that Bout flew into Afghanistan just before September 11 , 2001 . But Bout told CNN that the last time he was in Afghanistan was 1996 and that he never met terror mastermind Osama bin Laden . E-mail to a friend",To whom did Bout ship arms ?,warlords and militants
735,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an important milestone Wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid : For the first time in eight months , her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's campaign committee reported owing $ 2.3 million in debt at the end of March . On a day most Americans were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes , Clinton 's campaign committee filed finance documents with the Federal Election Commission , reporting a total of $ 2.3 million in debts at the end of March , compared with $ 2.6 million in the bank . The nation 's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her White House bid in June 2008 , when her debt peaked at $ 25.2 million . That amount covered $ 12 million owed to vendors , as well as the $ 13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds . Clinton 's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the Democratic National Convention convened in Denver , Colorado , last August , the deadline mandated by the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign finance law . The former New York senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount . Her campaign owed $ 6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of November ; $ 5.9 million to five creditors at the end of December ; and the current $ 2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of March . That creditor is Penn , Schoen & Berland , a political consulting and polling firm that advised Clinton during her presidential bid . The firm 's president , Mark Penn , was Clinton 's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last April amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of Colombia for a U.S.-Colombia trade deal that Clinton opposed . Penn remained involved with the campaign . Earlier this year , Clinton and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation 's 67th secretary of state on January 21 . As of that date , Clinton became subject to a federal law known as the Hatch Act , which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions . The Hatch Act allows others to keep raising money on Clinton 's behalf , without her direct involvement . This week , longtime Clinton ally James Carville , a CNN contributor , sent a fundraising e-mail to Democrats on behalf of Clinton 's campaign , requesting contributions of as little as $ 5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes , including spending a day with former President Bill Clinton . `` I wo n't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary , '' Carville e-mailed . `` I know what she means to you , and I 'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations . '' It 's unclear whether the campaign will use the $ 2.6 million in the bank to clear its $ 2.3 million in debts in the short term . Continued fundraising indicates that it will not . Additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge . Any extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors . Clinton 's campaign reported raising $ 938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009 . In addition to tapping traditional fundraising , the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations . It received $ 2.6 million from Clinton 's `` Friends of Hillary '' U.S. Senate campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $ 2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters . Organizations that have rented Clinton 's lists include the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , the inaugural committee of then-President-elect Barack Obama , and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation . Those organizations each paid $ 274,297 . Clinton 's political action committee , HillPAC , rented the lists for $ 822,492 . Among the Democratic candidates who have rented Clinton 's campaign lists are Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln ; Virginia gubernatorial candidate and former Clinton campaign Chairman Terry McAuliffe ; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who was appointed to fill Clinton 's seat ; and New York congressional candidate Scott Murphy , who hopes to succeed Gillibrand in the U.S. House .",How much campaign debt does Clinton have,2.3 million in

742,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday , a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman . The 20-term New York Democrat told reporters he had submitted a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting a temporary leave of absence until a broad-reaching House ethics committee investigation concludes . `` In order to avoid my colleagues ' having to defend me during their elections , I have this morning sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking her to grant me a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work , '' Rangel said Wednesday . In a statement , Pelosi said she had accepted Rangel 's request and praised the congressman for `` his decades of leadership on jobs , health care and the most significant economic issues of the day . '' Read Rangel 's letter to Pelosi The night before Rangel said he had no plans to step aside from his powerful post . The Ways and Means Committee is responsible for drafting the nation 's tax policies . Rangel is being investigated for , among other things , failing to pay taxes on a home in the Dominican Republic . The congressman also has admitted failing to report several hundred thousand dollars in assets on federal disclosure forms . In addition , he is under scrutiny for the purported misuse of a rent-controlled apartment for political purposes , as well as for allegedly preserving tax benefits for an oil-drilling company in exchange for donations to a project he supported at the City College of New York . Rangel was formally admonished Friday by the House ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts . Specifically , the committee found that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008 . Rangel 's staff , according to the committee , knew that corporations had given money to the Carib News , which sponsored the events . That fact had not been divulged to the ethics committee when Rangel asked for and received approval to attend the trips , according to the committee 's report . The committee found that while Rangel did not know about the contributions , he was nevertheless responsible . A source told CNN on Tuesday that if Rangel stepped aside , senior Ways and Means Democrat Pete Stark would take over as the committee 's chairman `` on a temporary basis . '' House Republicans plan to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on Rangel to permanently step down and again force House Democrats to go on record defending him . They issued a statement after Rangel 's announcement , calling his decision to temporarily step aside an `` embarrassing episode '' for the Democratic majority . `` Nancy Pelosi 's promise to run the ` most ethical Congress in history ' has been reduced to a punch line , and as a result she is presiding over a caucus in chaos , '' said GOP spokesman Ken Spain . `` The Democrats -- under Speaker Pelosi 's leadership -- are incapable of leading the United States Congress .

743,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver , the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics , died Tuesday , the Special Olympics said . She was 88 . Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006 . Born on July 10 , 1921 , in Brookline , Massachusetts , Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy . She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics , which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962 . Today , 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations , according to the Special Olympics . '' She was the light of our lives , a mother , wife , grandmother , sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others , '' the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement . `` For each of us , she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games , to visit us in our homes , to attend to her own mother , her sisters and brothers , and to sail , tell stories , and laugh and serve her friends . '' No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements , a source close to the family said . Shriver 's husband , R. Sargent Shriver , and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died , the Special Olympics said in a statement . Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver 's life '' `` We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder , '' Brady Lum , Special Olympics president and chief operating officer , said in a statement Tuesday . `` Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement . It is an enormous loss , but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family , friends , and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed . '' Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968 , Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector . She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets . In September 1962 , Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister , Rosemary , which was published in The Saturday Evening Post . At an event honoring her in 2007 , Shriver spoke of her life : `` Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities . `` As important as it has been , it is not the whole story of my life . My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities . It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children . ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband . '' Watch Shriver reflect on her life '' At the same event , Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister , saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents , including compassion . `` She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind . She picked this up , obviously , at a very early age . All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary . '' After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945 , helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life . From 1947 to 1948 , she worked for $ 1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency . See highlights of Shriver 's public and private life '' In the early 1950s , she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago , Illinois . She married Sargent Shriver Jr. , a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant , in 1953 . The couple 's five children include California 's first lady , Maria Shriver . Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s , including Head Start and the Peace Corps . He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics . He ran President Johnson 's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 . He was Democrat George McGovern 's running mate in the 1972 presidential election . In 1957 , Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. . Foundation , which was established in 1946 to honor the family 's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people . Watch Shriver receive a special honor '' Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy . In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children , adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008 . Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s , Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp , called Camp Shriver , on her farm in Maryland . Her vision expanded over the years , and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago . She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States , including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971 . In 1981 , Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers . That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006 . Along the way , Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards , including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom , the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame 's Founder 's Award and nine honorary degrees . In 1995 , the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait . The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin . In 2009 , a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery .

She was hospitalized again in 2007 for an undisclosed ailment .

744,"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy . Now , a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit . Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care . Depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby . Therefore , the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women , researchers say . `` There is no easy way out of this , '' says Dr. Tim Oberlander , a developmental pediatrician at BC Children 's Hospital , in Vancouver , Canada , who has studied the effects of SSRIs on children exposed in the womb , but was not involved in the current study . `` Depression needs to be managed , and for some women , the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary . '' Health.com : 3 Signs you should stop , adjust , or switch antidepressants The new study , led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund , of Aarhus University , in Denmark , found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU . Women have been using SSRIs during pregnancy since the early 1990s , Lund and her colleagues point out in the report , which is published in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine . These drugs , which include Zoloft , Prozac , and others , are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy . It 's been difficult to confirm their safety , however , especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in , like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn . Health.com : Do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix ? Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but were n't taking SSRIs . Some , but not all , of these women had suffered from depression . `` Using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders , '' the researcher notes . The analysis included 329 women who took SSRIs in pregnancy , 4,902 with a history of psychiatric illness who were n't taking the drugs , and 51,770 women who reported no history of psychiatric illness and were n't taking SSRIs . All had received prenatal care at Aarhus University Hospital between 1989 and 2006 . Babies of women taking SSRIs were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness , and were twice as likely to be born preterm . The babies whose mothers took SSRIs were 2.4 times as likely to have been admitted to the NICU than infants who had n't been exposed to the drugs in utero . They were also more than four times as likely to have Apgar scores below eight , just five minutes after birth . -LRB- Apgar scores measure an infant 's health at birth by looking at his or her breathing , heartbeat , reflexes , muscle tone , and skin color ; scores of seven and above are considered normal , and a newborn 's Apgar score has no influence on how he or she will fare later in life . -RRB- There was no difference between SSRI-exposed babies and unexposed babies in head circumference or birth weight . Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women 's mental health during pregnancy , notes Oberlander , who says depression in pregnancy is a `` huge public health issue '' with lasting implications for women and their children . Helping ensure that women are getting enough social support and adequate nutrition is essential , he adds , while alternative treatments for depression -- such as exercise , light therapy , and omega-3 fatty acids -- ought to be explored further . `` In general , optimizing non-pharmacological treatment would be a really important step , '' he says . He explains that it is essential to follow SSRI-exposed babies as they grow up , to identify any problems and intervene as necessary . However , he and Lund agree that it 's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child 's development and health . Health.com : 6 Rules for a healthy postpartum slim-down `` As depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction , treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence , '' Lund says . `` In cases with mild or moderate symptoms , psychotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment .

745,"-LRB- CNET -RRB- -- Would you like to let AT&T know when your iPhone has dropped a call ? Well , now there is an app for that . AT&T on Monday released a new application called `` Mark the Spot , '' which lets iPhone users submit complaints about dropped calls , poor service coverage , and less-than-perfect voice quality . The application is free and available in the iTunes App Store . It uses GPS technology in the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS to pin point where the user is when experiencing the problems . For first generation iPhones , it uses cell tower-triangulation to get a fix on problem areas . Once the application is launched , users have several complaint options . They will see a screen that has buttons that let them report a dropped call , poor voice quality , or poor service coverage . AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said AT&T plans to use the data collected to identify trends and prioritize the company 's network investments . `` We think this is a great way to get customer feedback to improve our network , '' Siegel said . '' We are always looking for ways to make it easy for customers to share their experiences . And this app lets customers report issues . It logs the time and location and automatically forwards the information to our network planning team . '' iPhone owners have been complaining about AT&T 's network since the Apple iPhone went on sale in the summer of 2007 . Complaints mounted after the 3G version of the phone was released a year later in 2008 . And as more iPhone users come onto the network , more people , particularly in densely populated urban areas , such as New York City and San Francisco , have experienced problems with dropped calls and congested data networks . AT&T executives have not said that AT&T has a problem with its network . But executives , such as AT&T Chief Technology Officer John Donovan , have said that the company has seen a surge in data traffic attributed to iPhone users , who typically consume more wireless bandwidth than other AT&T wireless customers . AT&T has been upgrading its network to keep up with demand . But problems persist . And AT&T 's network recently got a poor ranking in terms of customer satisfaction in a Consumer Reports survey . Verizon Wireless , AT&T 's chief rival , has taken advantage of AT&T 's struggles with a series of advertisements that point out AT&T 's lack of 3G network coverage in certain parts of the country . Verizon is running advertisements that mock the Apple `` There 's an app for that , '' catch phrase with one that says , `` There 's a map for that . '' AT&T fired back with a lawsuit and an advertisements of its own featuring actor Luke Wilson , who points out AT&T 's strengths while taking a few shots at Verizon Wireless . AT&T recently dropped its lawsuit against Verizon . And Verizon , which had been suing AT&T over claims that it has the fastest 3G wireless network , also dropped its lawsuit against AT&T . Siegel said that the new `` Mark the Spot '' application was not prompted by the bad publicity around its network issues nor was it prompted by the current ad wars going on between AT&T and Verizon . Instead , he said that the application was simply a part of AT&T 's ongoing commitment to listening to customers . `` We are always looking at ways to get customer feedback in as timely a manner as possible , '' he said . `` That 's why we pay attention to Twitter , Facebook and blog . One of the great values of these social networking tools is that it 's a great way to get instant feedback . And it helps us identify problems . '' The `` Mark the Spot '' application can be downloaded onto all iPhones running version 3.0 or later of Apple 's operating system or it can be access using iTunes and synchronized to the iPhone via a PC or Mac . Siegel said that AT&T is testing the `` Mark the Spot '' app for other devices . And he said AT&T hopes to offer applications on other smartphones in the future . No date has been announced yet . And Siegel did n't specify which devices might get the new application , but considering that AT&T sells a lot of Research in Motion 's BlackBerry devices , it 's likely it will create an application for that device . The app could be offered through AT&T 's own application storefront or through RIM 's BlackBerry App World . © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. . All rights reserved .

746,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A double amputee sprinter has won the right to be eligible to compete at this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing after sport 's highest court backed his appeal against a ban imposed by athletics authorities . Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorious competed in two able-bodied athletics meetings in 2007 . The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that South African Oscar Pistorius , who runs on prosthetic blades , is eligible to compete against able-bodied athletes . Pistorius , 21 , who lost both legs below the knees when he was a baby , runs on shock-absorbing carbon-fiber prosthetics that resemble bent skis -- earning him the nickname `` Blade Runner . '' Pistorius , a Paralympic Games champion and world record holder , had lobbied the International Association of Athletics Federations -LRB- IAAF -RRB- to allow him to compete at the Olympics this August , but after extensive tests the IAAF ruled in January that his J-shaped prosthetics qualify as technical aids , which are banned in IAAF-governed sports . The IAAF does allow athletes with prosthetics to compete in able-bodied sports , as long as the IAAF believes they do not give the athlete an unfair edge . But Friday 's ruling by the CAS in Lausanne , Switzerland , overturned that verdict . In a statement , it said that its panel had `` not been persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of a double-amputee '' using Pistorius ' blades . Appeals of court decisions are allowed , but on very limited grounds . But the CAS said it did not exclude the possibility that future scientific tests could be developed which might enable the IAAF to prove that the blades provided Pistorius with an advantage over able-bodied athletes . The South African won gold in the 200 meters , and bronze in the 100 meters at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens . He holds the Paralympic world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters . Since Athens , he has competed in two able-bodied races in which he finished second and last , respectively . Pistorius will have emphasized to the court the disadvantages he feels he has by running with prosthetics , CNN World Sport 's Don Riddell said . `` There are disadvantages when it 's windy , when it 's raining , -LRB- and -RRB- it takes him longer to get up to speed at the start , '' Riddell said . `` He will be hoping that they take everything into consideration and not just rule on how much spring his prosthetic limbs give him . '' In November , the IAAF carried out tests on Pistorius over two days at the German Sport University in Cologne to determine if his prosthetics , known as Cheetah limbs , could be considered a technical aid . A team of more than 10 scientists used high-speed cameras , special equipment to measure ground-reaction forces , and a three-dimensional scanner to record body mass . The scientists concluded Pistorius was able to run with his prosthetic blades at the same speed as able-bodied sprinters with about 25 percent less energy expenditure . Pistorius ' blades gave him an energy return nearly three times higher than the human ankle joint offers in maximum sprinting , they said . Riddell described Friday 's ruling in Pistorius ' favor as `` groundbreaking , '' and said it raised questions about the future of paralympic sports . `` What does this do to the future of the Paralympics if he 's allowed to run in the able-bodied Olympics ? Is he actually doing a disservice to other Paralympic athletes ? Does it cheapen the Paralympic Games ? '' Riddell asked .",What does Pistorius hold ?,"the Paralympic world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters"
747,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration has decided to rescind invitations to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth celebrations overseas because of violent crackdowns against protesters in Iran , the White House said Wednesday . President Obama on Tuesday toughened his stance on Iran 's crackdown on protesters . `` July Fourth allows us to celebrate the freedom and the liberty we enjoy : freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom to assemble peacefully , freedom of the press , '' White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . `` Given the events of the past many days , those invitations will no longer be extended . '' The administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of the president 's policy of engaging the Iranian regime . In late May the State Department sent a cable to its embassies and consulates worldwide informing them they `` may invite representatives from the government of Iran '' to their July Fourth celebrations . But in a fresh cable sent to all embassies and consulates Wednesday evening , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered posts `` to rescind all invitations that have been extended to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth events . `` Unfortunately the circumstances have changed and participation by Iranian diplomats would not be appropriate in light of the Iranian government 's continued violent and unjust actions against its own people , '' said the cable , obtained by CNN . `` For invitations which have been extended , posts should make clear that Iranian participation is no longer appropriate in the current circumstances . For invitations which have not been extended , no further action is needed . '' A senior administration official said Clinton made the decision , and then informed President Obama . The U.S. receptions marking Independence Day usually feature symbols of Americana , such as hot dogs , red-white-and-blue decorations and remarks by U.S. officials about America 's founding fathers . One senior administration official said Wednesday the reconsideration of the July Fourth invitations is consistent with Obama 's comments Tuesday , in which he said he was `` shocked and appalled '' at the violence against demonstrators . `` The president said yesterday how this plays out will affect what we do , '' the official said . Obama said Tuesday , `` If Iran chooses a path that abides by international norms and principles , then we are interested in healing some of the wounds of 30 years in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations . '' Watch Obama ramp up criticism of Iran '' On Tuesday , Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , R-Florida , the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said an invitation to Iranian diplomats would send the wrong message to Iranians `` who are bravely standing up for the same rights and freedoms which Americans celebrate on this day . '' `` The Fourth of July is a day when we celebrate democracy and reflect on the gift of freedom which all Americans cherish , '' she said in a statement . `` The Iranian people are no less worthy of freedom and self-governance than citizens of the United States . '' Earlier this year , as part of the policy to engage Iran , Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government . In March , Richard Holbrooke , the Obama administration 's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , spoke briefly with Iran 's deputy foreign minister , Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh , at an Afghanistan conference in The Hague . Administration officials believe the U.S. will engage Iran at some point to address issues of U.S. national security , including the nuclear issue , but the idea of bilateral engagement is in a holding pattern while the violence continues . `` I would n't say engagement is off the table , but it is certainly on ice , '' a senior administration official said this week .",What did the administration plan ?,The Obama administration has decided to rescind invitations to Iranian diplomats

Obama 's response was : `` There was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq . '' McCain was in Tyler , Texas , and Obama was in Columbus , Ohio . `` I understand that Sen. Obama said that if al Qaeda established a base in Iraq that he would send troops back in militarily .

He was asked if the president would have the right to go back into Iraq in order to suppress an insurrection after downsizing the U.S. troop presence .

'' `` I said , ` Well first of all , I do know that al Qaeda is in Iraq . That 's why I 've said we should continue to strike al Qaeda targets .

750,"New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination , the CDC said late Monday . The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville , New York , was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli , a potentially deadly species of bacteria . The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe 's , Price Chopper , Lancaster and Wild Harvest , Shaw 's , BJ 's , Ford Brothers , and Giant Food Stores . The exact products affected are listed on the USDA 's Web site . The recall was for distribution centers in eight states , but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states . Each package is printed with `` EST. 492 '' inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label . They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28 , the USDA said . Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall , the USDA said . E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and in the most severe cases , kidney failure . The very young , seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness . The USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products , whether they are fresh or frozen , and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit . The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature , the FSIS said . Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak , eight are in Massachusetts ; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire ; two each are in Maine , Pennsylvania and South Dakota ; and one each is in California , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , New York and Vermont , according to the CDC .",What symptoms can E.coli cause ?,"bloody diarrhea , dehydration , and in the most severe cases , kidney failure"
751,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man suspected of fatally shooting an Iowa football coach Wednesday was released from a hospital the day before , without the knowledge of police , who had asked to be notified , authorities said . Ed Thomas had been with the school district for more than 30 years and was well-known in the region . Mark Becker , 24 , faces first-degree murder charges in the death of Ed Thomas , 58 , a longtime football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School . Investigators believe Becker walked into the school 's weight room , where Thomas was overseeing athletes ' weight lifting , about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday and shot him multiple times as about 20 horrified students looked on . Thomas was flown to a hospital , where he later died . `` It 's just too early to speculate '' on a motive for the shooting , said Kevin Winker , assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation . Authorities said Becker was a former student at Aplington-Parkersburg , which is about 100 miles northeast of Des Moines , Iowa , and a former football player . The agency , however , noted that Becker had `` recent contact '' with police in Cedar Falls , Iowa , about 25 miles to the east of Parkersburg . On June 20 , Becker led police on a high-speed chase after he allegedly broke into a man 's house , according to a division statement . He was taken into custody , but early the next morning authorities determined he needed medical attention and he was taken to a hospital . Police asked to be notified when he was released , the statement said . But on Tuesday , Becker was released and spent the night at his parents ' Parkersburg home before heading to the high school Wednesday morning , the division said . `` Law enforcement was unaware that Becker had been released . '' Cedar Falls police earlier said in a statement that they responded June 20 to a report of a man breaking several windows in a Cedar Falls home with a baseball bat and driving his car through a garage door . Just before officers arrived , the man fled the scene in his car and was seen leaving the area . Becker was arrested after a pursuit that reached speeds of more than 80 mph , Cedar Falls police said . He was taken into custody by Butler County authorities and later taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation , according to the statement . `` Cedar Falls police was awaiting notification that the subject was to be released from custody in order to arrest Becker and file the charges relevant to the Cedar Falls incident , '' according to the police statement . He faces felony charges of criminal mischief and eluding authorities , along with traffic offenses , in the Saturday incident , Cedar Falls police said . Winker would not provide further details about why Becker was transported to the hospital . A 911 call was received at 7:47 a.m. Wednesday regarding the high school shooting , the Division of Criminal Investigation said . Becker was located in the driveway of his parents ' home , where he was arrested without incident . Coincidentally , Becker had been released from the same hospital where his alleged victim died -- Covenant Hospital in Waterloo , Iowa . Thomas had been with the school district since 1975 and was a regionally well-known coach , according to district Superintendent Jon Thompson . The coach 's son , Aaron Thomas , spoke briefly to reporters Wednesday , saying that his father would want to be remembered not only as a coach , teacher and father , but also for his involvement in his church , calling him `` a man of deep faith who touched many lives . '' `` God always has a reason , '' he said . `` At this time , it 's very tough for us to understand that . '' He thanked the community for an outpouring of support , recalling residents ' struggle to rebuild after a deadly tornado struck the Parkersburg area last year . But he also reminded residents to have concern and compassion for Becker 's family . `` We ask that people pray for them as well , and that people take time to comfort and be with them , '' he said . `` I know that my father 's legacy ... will live on , '' Aaron Thomas said . `` Without a doubt , we 're going to miss him . We will have many great memories to share and to think back upon . We were lucky to have the father we had ... I feel very fortunate to be the son of Ed Thomas . '' No students were injured or threatened in Wednesday 's incident , authorities said . The school was placed on lockdown immediately . Crisis counselors were on the scene to assist students who witnessed the shooting , Thompson said . A vigil was planned in Thomas ' honor Wednesday night .

752,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four senators pushed for a bill Wednesday to ban texting while driving , a day after a study found that drivers who text while on the road are much more likely to have an accident than undistracted drivers . A law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving . Sens. Chuck Schumer , D-New York ; Robert Menendez , D-New Jersey ; Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan , D-North Carolina , unveiled the ALERT Act , which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving . The proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle , said an earlier news release from the senators . If the bill passes , the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance . States that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill 's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds , Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation . The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards , Schumer said . CTIA , a cellular phone industry group , said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving . `` CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving , '' said a statement on CTIA 's Web site . Fourteen states , including the home states of three of the bill 's sponsors , and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving : Alaska , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , Tennessee , Utah , Virginia and Washington . Interactive map : See state-by-state policies on distracted driving '' New York does not ban texting while driving but has barred the use of handheld phones while driving , according to the Governor 's Highway Safety Association . Schumer said New York 's legislature has sent Gov. David Paterson a bill to ban texting as well . `` The legislation will send an important message to drivers across the country : Get your hands off the cell phone and back on the wheel , '' Schumer said . The senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers . Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting When compared with dialing , talking , listening or reaching for an electronic device , texting posed the greatest accident risk , the study found . It attributed the increased risk to the almost five seconds it found that the driver 's eyes were off the roadway while texting , said Rich Hanowski , the director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the transportation institute . `` Not having -LSB- a cell phone -RSB- in your hand while driving could be the difference between life and death , '' Menendez said . In September , a commuter train engineer missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend , leading to a collision with a freight train that killed 25 people in California , according to federal investigators . The accident also injured 101 people . In May , 62 people were injured when one trolley struck another in Boston , Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said . In July , the operator of one trolley was charged with gross negligence after he admitted to texting seconds before the accident with the other trolley , according to the Suffolk County district attorney and a National Transportation Safety Board official .

756,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Motor Sport 's governing body , the FIA , have formally confirmed the entry list for the 2010 Formula One season -- with potential newcomers US F1 omitted from the grid . The financially-troubled team had asked the FIA if they could miss the first four races of the season in order to attract extra sponsorship , but have instead been told that they must re-apply if they are to be on the grid for the following season . The official entry list shows 12 teams and 24 drivers -- two teams more than last season . Three new teams are lining up -- Lotus , Virgin Racing and Hispania Racing -- with Toyota deciding to leave the sport . There are also two team name changes . Last year 's winning constructor 's Brawn GP have been taken over by Mercedes , while BMW Sauber have reverted back to being the Sauber team , although they have to retain the BMW title for this season due to legal obligations . Meanwhile , there is also no place on the grid for the proposed Serbian-backed Stefan GP team , who had been hoping to gain a late entry in place of US F1 . An official FIA statement read : `` The US F1 Team have indicated they will not be in a position to participate in the 2010 FIA Formula One world championship . `` Having considered the various options , the FIA confirms it is not possible for a replacement team to be entered for the championship at this late stage . `` In the coming days the FIA will announce details of a new selection process to identify candidates to fill any vacancies existing at the start of the 2011 season . '' US F1 have faced a race against time to have their car ready for the grid , after a number of sponsors opted to pull out the project . Production of the car had been stopped with the team struggling to pay wages , resulting in a number of staff choosing to leave . Team principal Ken Anderson is yet to comment on whether he will attempt to make the grid for the 2011 season . The decision leaves Argentinian Jose Maria Lopez , who had already been offered a drive with US F1 , without a team . Tuesday also saw the final driver appointment confirmed , with Karun Chandhok becoming the second Indian to compete in the sport having been named by Hispania Racing . The 26-year-old follows in the footsteps of Narain Karthikeyan , who had one season with Jordan in 2005 .

757,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans . E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals . Known as `` e-cigarettes , '' the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals , spiced with flavors such as chocolate , cola or bubble gum . While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a `` healthy way '' to smoke , federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user . `` The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public , '' said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg , commissioner of the FDA . CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere , one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes , after the FDA announcement , and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment . Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval , the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user . That is why the FDA began to test them . The FDA 's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes . In releasing its information , the FDA did not identify the two companies , but said in one sample , diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected . Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them , the FDA said . The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008 . To date , 50 shipments have been stopped . The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . `` We know very little about these devices , said Dr. Jonathan Samet , director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California , `` but to say they are healthy -- that 's highly doubtful . '' Samet and other health experts attended the FDA announcement on its findings . Dr. Jonathan Winickoff , chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium , said parents need to be aware of e-cigarettes . `` It is very important that parents let their children know these are not safe and to make recommendations , or even enforce rules that they not be used , '' he said . `` Children who use these products may also be using other tobacco products , '' said Dr. Matthew McKenna , director of the Office of Smoking and Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` It 's a good idea to make sure the child is aware of the dangers of tobacco in products in general . '' The FDA has been challenged regarding its jurisdiction over certain e-cigarettes in a case pending in federal court . The FDA suggested health care professionals and consumers report serious side effects or product quality problems with the use of e-cigarettes to the FDA 's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program either online , by regular mail , fax or phone .

758,"Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko refuses to concede defeat in Ukraine 's presidential election and plans to demand a recount in some districts , officials from her party , Bloc Tymoshenko , said Tuesday . Meanwhile , her rival , former Ukrainian prime minister Victor Yanukovich told CNN it is time for her to give up . Yanukovich is leading Sunday 's runoff election . With 99.98 percent of the votes counted , he has 48.96 percent , while Tymoshenko has 45.47 percent , according to the country 's Central Election Commission . Yanukovich 's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until the vote count was final and their candidate named the winner , Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported . In an exclusive interview with CNN Tuesday , Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power . `` This country has been democratic for five years , and that 's been proven again by this election , '' he said . `` Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution '' by failing to acknowledge defeat . A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising . Ukrainian voter Nikolay Gluhovskiy said he supported Yanukovich because Tymoshenko had been a disappointment . `` All the time Yulia Tymoshenko has been in power , we had no prospects , '' he said at a Yanukovich rally Monday . `` Of course , she is a fighter , but in a bad sense . She should n't have promised us so much and done nothing . '' Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday , the Kremlin told CNN . `` Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign , which was highly rated by international observers , and the success achieved at the presidential election , '' the Kremlin 's statement press statement said . The Kremlin statement did not offer congratulations for a Yanukovich win , however . During the 2004 presidential election , then-Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first world leader to congratulate Yanukovich on his victory , a full two days before the electoral commission declared him the winner . Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night , Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down . But Tymoshenko has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts where , she says , voting irregularities took place , officials from her party said Tuesday . The two politicians have fought a bitter battle . Yanukovich has strong links to Russia , and a checkered election history . In 2004 , he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot 's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race . `` The country remembers times when there were presidents announced , they received congratulations , and then things changed , '' Tymoshenko said Sunday , referring to the 2004 race . A pro-Western uprising , known as the Orange Revolution , followed . Yanukovich 's win was annulled , and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote . Yushchenko ran for a second term this year , but , blamed for Ukraine 's faltering economy , he did not make the runoff . This year 's elections , by contrast to those in 2004 , got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which sent observers . The OSCE hailed the process as `` professional , transparent and honest , '' saying it should `` serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power .

759,"KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Civilian deaths in Afghanistan have risen sharply in the past year , largely due to more Taliban attacks and roadside bombings , U.N. officials said Sunday . NATO soldiers sit in their vehicle in an Afghan province freed from Taliban forces . Afghan civilian deaths jumped from 430 in the first six months of 2007 to 698 so far this year , an increase of 60 percent , said John Holmes , the United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs . `` It is clear that the international military forces are making every effort to minimize civilian casualties , '' Holmes said . `` Nevertheless , these problems are still there , and we need to deal with them and make sure that the safety of civilians comes first and international humanitarian law is respected , '' he said . Taliban insurgents forces have shifted from direct attacks on international troops toward the use of `` civilian-blind '' measures such as roadside bombings and suicide attacks , said Aleem Siddique , a spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan . At the same time , he said , civilian deaths blamed on government forces and U.S. and NATO troops has declined in the first six months of 2008 , largely due to pressure from Afghan President Hamid Karzai . About 60 percent of civilian deaths in 2008 are blamed on anti-government forces , up from less than half in 2007 . Increased Taliban attacks on aid projects also have left 78 of Afghanistan 's 398 districts off-limits to relief workers , Siddique said . `` Increasingly , we 're seeing targets of schools , of radio stations , of health clinics -- all in an effort to halt progress and keep people in fear , '' he said . A total of 565 aid convoys came under attack in 2007 , with hundreds of tons of food hijacked . As recently as Sunday , a convoy of 100 tons of food aid came under attack outside Kandahar , with several trucks burned and looted , he said . `` Thankfully , we 're not getting any report of death or injuries , '' he said . Afghanistan is the original front in the `` war on terrorism , '' which was launched after al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington . A U.S.-led invasion after the attacks pushed out the Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but the Islamic fundamentalist militia has regrouped along and across the mountainous border with Pakistan . Coinciding with the rise in civilian deaths in 2008 is an increase in attacks on American and allied forces , which are up 40 percent since last year The death toll of U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan in June also climbed to more than 40 , making it the deadliest month since the war began . An explosion in southern Afghanistan killed a British soldier serving with NATO on Saturday , the British Defense Ministry said Sunday . The soldier died when he was struck by a mine in Lashkar Gah , the capital city of Helmand province , the ministry said . He and his unit were investigating a report of a rocket-propelled grenade attack on a civilian aircraft at a nearby airfield , it said . `` When investigating this , they dismounted their vehicles and what is believed to have been a legacy anti-Personnel mine detonated , killing the soldier instantly , '' the ministry statement said . Most of the soldiers serving in Helmand are British . Helmand province is Afghanistan 's top poppy-producing region and a major front in the war against the Taliban . Provincial authorities there have blamed militants for a spate of recent deadly attacks . NATO and Afghan force operations kept the insurgency down in 2007 by killing or capturing key leaders and clearing out Taliban safe havens , but a Pentagon report issued last week predicted the Taliban would be back in 2008 .",What happened to a British NATO soldier ?,died when he was struck by a mine
760,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Accused enemy combatant Ali al-Marri was served with an arrest warrant Tuesday and transferred out of U.S. military custody for the first time since 2003 , according to the U.S. Justice Department . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . Al-Marri 's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday . Defense Secretary Robert Gates released the Qatari man to the U.S. Marshals Service in preparation for the hearing . On Friday , the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss al-Marri 's challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely and without charges . The high court ruled that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges . The court 's ruling means there is no resolution of the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain people accused of terrorism and other crimes in the United States . The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in virtual isolation in a Navy brig in Charleston , South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . Al-Marri had been accused of being an al Qaeda `` sleeper agent , '' but until the indictment had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . The 43-year-old man will be sent at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . He subsequently issued a presidential memorandum ordering Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , saying it was `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri -- a legal resident of the United States -- had remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and were challenging the constitutionality of his detention . The Pentagon asserts al-Marri had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to a government filing with the Supreme Court .",What is Al-Marri accused of doing ?,of being an al Qaeda `` sleeper agent

Chad President Idriss Deby , right , and Sudan 's President Omar al-Beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar , Senegal , between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby , the president of Chad . Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq . Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . The rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad . They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena , the capital of Chad , in early February . As recently as Thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border . Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby 's regime . The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region . Kingsley Amaning , the U.N. 's humanitarian coordinator for Chad , said more than 10,000 people from Darfur , in Sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad . They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there . The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , Kingsley said .

763,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama has ordered a review of security screening processes after Friday 's botched terror attack on a U.S. airliner , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday . Appearing on the ABC program `` This Week '' and the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' Gibbs said Obama is receiving regular briefings by his national security staff on the incident in which a suspect allegedly tried to detonate an explosive device on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , The Netherlands , making its final approach to Detroit , Michigan . The suspect , 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was on a broad watch list of 550,000 names since last month , Gibbs said . That list does not automatically bring tighter screening of individuals , Gibbs said , and Obama has ordered a review of the procedures for determining which people on the list undergo more stringent checking . Obama also called for `` a review to ... figure out why an individual with the chemical explosive he had on him could get on a plane in Amsterdam and fly into the United States , '' Gibbs said on NBC . `` The president is very confident that this government is taking the steps that are necessary to take our fight to those who seek to do us harm , '' Gibbs said on the ABC program . Authorities on Sunday focused their investigation on how a lone traveler smuggled explosives aboard the Northwest Airlines flight and who might have helped him . Abdulmutallab , who had a multiple entry visa to the United States , was charged Saturday in a federal criminal complaint . Q&A : Why did security checks fail to spot explosives People on the flight described a chaotic scene that began with a popping sound followed by flames erupting at Abdulmutallab 's seat . Jasper Schuringa , a Dutch passenger on the flight from Amsterdam , leaped across the aisle to grab the suspect , who according to authorities suffered burns on his legs . Schuringa told CNN he saw that Abdulmutallab was holding a burning object between his legs . `` I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away , '' Schuringa said . He said he heard fire extinguishers as he pulled Abdulmutallab out of his seat and dragged him to the front of the plane . In Nigeria , Abdulmutallab checked no baggage on his trip that originated in Lagos on a KLM flight to Amsterdam , where he changed planes to the Northwest flight , according to Harold Demuren , director-general of Nigeria 's Civil Aviation Authority . The suspect had a shoulder bag and went through the normal check-in process with his passport and U.S. visa scanned , Demuren said Sunday . The multiple-entry U.S. visa was issued in London , England , in June 2008 with an expiration date of June 2010 , Demuren said . Abdulmutallab then passed through a walk-through metal detector and put his shoulder bag through an X-ray screening machine , Demuren said . He also said the suspect underwent secondary screening at the boarding gate for the KLM flight , according to officials of the Dutch airline . The father of the suspect recently contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns his son was planning something , a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday . The father -- identified by a family source as Umaru Abdulmutallab -- contacted the embassy `` a few weeks ago '' saying his son , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , had `` become radicalized , '' the senior administration official , who is familiar with the case , told CNN . A family source told CNN that the elder Abdulmutallab -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC , one of Nigeria 's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in Nigeria 's capital , Abuja , and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official . The family source said Abdulmutallab went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son . The source , who lives at the family home in Kaduna in northern Nigeria , said the son informed his family in the text message that he was leaving school in Dubai to move to Yemen . He implied that he was leaving `` for the course of Islam . '' The family member said Abdulmutallab `` had no family consent or support , '' adding he `` absconded to Yemen . '' Abdulmutallab 's information about his son was forwarded to the National Counter-Terrorism Center , and Abdulmutallab was added to a general watch list , a senior administration official said . But the official said `` the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list . '' In addition , the official said there was `` no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa '' back in June 2008 . A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into Abdulmutallab said investigators are still trying to trace his past travels . `` Investigators are looking into any al Qaeda connections and whether he had help and training from Yemen , '' the law enforcement official said . A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device on the plane contained PETN , also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate , a highly explosive chemical compound . In addition , FBI agents recovered what appear to be remnants of a syringe near Abdulmutallab 's seat , believed to have been part of the device . The family source said Abdulmutallab received a college degree at the University College London , where spokesman Dave Weston said a man named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab was enrolled in the mechanical engineering department between September 2005 and June 2008 . When Abdulmutallab returned to Nigeria from London , he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in Cairo , Egypt , or Saudi Arabia , the family source said . The family refused because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people . He went to Dubai instead , the source said , where he sent a text message saying he had gone to Yemen to start a new life and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his SIM card . Abdulmutallab 's father notified the U.S. Embassy with information on his son , saying the family feared he went to Yemen to participate in `` some kind of jihad . '' A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday `` was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used . '' Yemeni authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt , according to a Yemeni official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media . But , the source said the country 's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect 's alleged link to the country is officially identified . Earlier Saturday , the Netherlands ' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that Abdulmutallab had gone through `` normal security procedures '' in Amsterdam before boarding the flight and those were `` well-performed . '' The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups , a U.S. administration official said . Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Mississippi , who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security , said the attempted act of terrorism would be the focus of an oversight hearing next month . Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D-West Virginia , also said his Senate Commerce Committee would hold a hearing on the incident . In Nigeria , the government said Saturday that it `` received with dismay the news of attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. airline '' and has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident . Officials from the Nigerian Embassy in Washington have flown to Michigan `` to gain Consular access '' to Abdulmutallab , the embassy said in a statement Saturday . The embassy said it plans to cooperate with U.S. authorities . An official with the Transportation Security Administration told CNN there will be increased security measures taken on international flights to the United States . The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before the flight . There will be no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed .

764,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor Sr. . was sentenced Friday to 97 years in prison for charges including torture and conspiracy , according to a federal court in Florida . The U.S.-born son of Charles Taylor Sr. , pictured , moved to Liberia when his father became president . U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Charles `` Chuckie '' Taylor Jr. , 31 , in a Friday morning session that lasted four hours , according to a court document . Altonaga cited Taylor 's `` sadistic , cruel and atrocious past , '' saying it `` constituted unacceptable , universally condemned torture , '' The Miami Herald reported . `` The lengthy prison term handed down today justly reflects the horror and torture that Taylor Jr. visited upon his victims , '' said Matthew Friedrich , acting assistant attorney general of the criminal division . Taylor , also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel , was convicted October 30 of torture , conspiracy to commit torture and firearm charges . His case , tried in Miami , was the first brought under a 1994 U.S. law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court , as long as the person is a U.S. national or is present in the United States , regardless of nationality . Calls to Taylor 's defense attorneys were not immediately returned . Prosecutors had asked for Taylor to be sentenced to 147 years . Taylor was born in Boston , Massachusetts , but he moved to Liberia when his father was named president . Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president . The two groups are accused of abducting , torturing and killing people . From 1999 to 2002 , Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture , prosecutors said . Taylor and his associated burned victims with molten plastic , lighted cigarettes , candle wax and an iron . Some were severely beaten with firearms , cut and stabbed and shocked with an electric device , prosecutors said in an indictment that superseded the initial indictment from 2006 . In the initial indictment , Taylor was charged with one count of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime . The superseding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture , one count of conspiracy to torture , one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime . The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims . Also Friday , the World Organization for Human Rights USA filed a civil class action suit against Taylor on behalf of a group of people who are said to have been subjected to torture and other human rights abuses by Taylor or his subordinates , according to the organization . The suit seeks declaratory relief and general , compensatory and punitive damages , the organization said in a written statement . `` This civil suit aims to address Defendant Taylor 's wrongs on a much greater scale '' than the criminal trial , the organization said . Taylor 's father , Charles Taylor Sr. , is standing trial in The Hague , Netherlands , on war crimes charges .

765,"State College , Pennsylvania -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Penn State students and alumni held a candlelight vigil late Sunday to honor and remember Joe Paterno , the iconic former football coach . Paterno , 85 , died Sunday at a State College , Pennsylvania , hospital , according to his family . He had been suffering from lung cancer and had recently broken his pelvis . `` It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today , '' said the statement . `` His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled . '' Students braved freezing temperatures to attend the vigil on the lawn of the Old Main building on Penn State 's campus . They held candles , locked arms , and sung the school 's alma mater to say goodbye . Later , they walked over to a statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium , which has become a sort of makeshift memorial . `` He 's more than a coach ; his family 's more than a family , '' said Bethanna Edmiston , a local resident and alumna who met her husband at Penn State . `` It 's extremely difficult for the whole Nittany nation , '' she said . `` Unless you 're part of Penn State , you just do n't understand what it means . '' Share your thoughts on Paterno 's death Earlier on Sunday , many fans were seen crying as they stood at the statue . It features Paterno with his index finger outstretched in the `` No. 1 '' gesture . A quote from Paterno , who spent 61 years at Penn State , is on the wall behind the statue . `` They ask me what I 'd like written about me when I 'm gone , '' the quote says . `` I hope they write I made Penn State a better place , not just that I was a good football coach . '' Edmiston said she moved to State College at age 8 , as Paterno took the reins at Penn State . `` Our family thanks Penn Staters , students & all people for prayers & support for my Dad , '' Paterno 's son , Jay Paterno , tweeted Sunday , `` He felt your support in his fight . '' Family statement : `` He fought hard until the end '' The gathering at the statue has been ongoing since Saturday night , after a family spokesman said Paterno 's condition had worsened . Some shoveled snow so others could walk up and touch Paterno 's outstretched hand on his statue . Signs , flowers and candles surrounded the statue , along with photographs of Paterno . `` You 're our hero , '' one said . Another one , flanked by candles , simply said : `` Coach . '' Jay Paterno tweeted Saturday night that he drove by the statue , and that the love and support inspired his father . `` He died as he lived , '' the family statement said . `` He fought hard until the end , stayed positive , thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been . '' Media falsely report Paterno 's death Several websites that reported Saturday night that Paterno had died later apologized for the error , including the Penn State student news website Onward State , the first to report the erroneous information . Paterno was fired in November amid outrage over the handling of accusations against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky , who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994 . Sandusky has pleaded not guilty . But several of those gathered at the statue Sunday remembered Paterno as a unifying presence both at the university and in State College . `` I want everyone in our whole country to know that Joe united us , '' said Diane Farley , a Penn State alumna and current university employee . `` And I do n't want anyone to point fingers at anyone anymore , and I want them to know that State College is a place that cares , because Joe cared , and there 's just been a lot of confusion in the past six weeks ... We 're all on this Earth together . We 're all going to go out eventually , like Joe , and we need to be a little bit more loving and caring with each other . '' `` They 're just ordinary people , '' Edmiston said of the Paterno family . `` They lived in the same house since they moved there , not a fancy house , just everyday people . They gave everything they had to Penn State -- not only money , but their time , their efforts . It 's just an amazing legacy that he 's left behind . '' Another man said he does n't believe the scandal will tarnish Paterno 's memory . `` It wo n't define him , '' said the man , who did not give his name . `` It was n't who he was . '' The family previously said Paterno had a treatable form of cancer . In December , he was admitted to a hospital after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home in State College . Under Paterno 's 46-year leadership , the Nittany Lions won two national championships , went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times , according to his official Penn State biography . Sports Illustrated : Paterno 's legacy was more than the final chapter At the time of Paterno 's dismissal , Vice Chairman of Trustees John P. Surma said he hoped the school 's 95,000 students and hundreds of thousands of alumni would believe the decision `` is in the best long-term interest of the university , which is much larger than athletic programs . '' Paterno told the Washington Post this month he felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse against Sandusky . `` I did n't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was , '' Paterno told the Post . `` So I backed away and turned it over to some other people , people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did . It did n't work out that way . '' The former coach spoke with a raspy voice during the interview -- Paterno 's first extensive comments since being fired . A Penn State graduate assistant , Mike McQueary , told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky `` with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line . '' He said he had gone to Paterno with what he saw . Paterno said he 'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report , but that he nevertheless reported the allegations to his boss , then-Athletic Director Tim Curley . Curley and Gary Schultz , a former university vice president , have been charged with perjury and failure to report the abuse allegations , which law enforcement did not learn about for several years . They have pleaded not guilty . `` You know , he did n't want to get specific , '' Paterno said about McQueary . `` And to be frank with you I do n't know that it would have done any good , because I never heard of , of , rape and a man . So I just did what I thought was best . I talked to people that I thought would be , if there was a problem , that would be following up on it , '' he told The Washington Post . `` I called my superiors and I said , ` Hey , we got a problem , I think . Would you guys look into it ? ' Because I did n't know , you know ... I had never had to deal with something like that . And I did n't feel adequate , '' Paterno said . `` Joe was Penn State , '' Edmiston said . `` He made Penn State . And it 's really a very sad , sad day for all of us .

766,"COLOMBO , Sri Lanka -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five members of the Sri Lanka 's Civil Defense Force -LRB- CDF -RRB- were killed in a suicide blast in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning , police said . Sri Lankan police officers investigate Sunday 's suicide bombing near Colombo . Eight other CDF officers and two civilians were wounded , police said . Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast , but police suspect the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels . There was no immediate response from the Tamil Tiger rebels to the incident , which , police said , occurred at St. Anne 's Church in the Colombo suburb of Wattala , located on a roadway to the country 's only international airport about 15 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- north of the capital . The attack happened during a weekly festival that usually draws a large crowd shopping for vegetables and household goods . The suicide bomber walked into an area where CDF officers were stationed and detonated his explosives , police said . Investigators suspect the bomber targeted the area because 150 police officers who help patrol the road to the airport are billeted there . Government forces have engaged rebels in heavy fighting for more than a year in the Kilinochchi region , once the center of political power for the Tamil Tigers . The 25-year civil war between ethnic Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government has left more than 65,000 people dead . The Tamil Tigers were founded in 1976 , and the U.S. State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997 . The rebels , formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- LTTE -RRB- , are fighting for the creation of an independent nation , citing discrimination by the country 's Sinhalese majority . Earlier Sunday , Sri Lanka 's navy said it had destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel boat allegedly attempting to smuggle in military supplies through the northern coast . Commander D.K.P. Dissanayake , a navy spokesman , told CNN that four rebels were killed in attack after the boat was engulfed in fire . He said the incident occurred just after midnight Sunday but gave no other details . There was no immediate response from the Tiger rebels to that incident . CNN could not independently verify the government 's claim because media is debarred from Sri Lanka 's battle zones . In the past , both sides in the conflict have exaggerated accounts of military operations . On December 20 , the Navy said it destroyed a similar rebel boat trying to smuggle military supplies through the coast near the northeastern coastal village of Mullaitivu . However , a second supply boat was caught on Air Force aerial surveillance cameras unloading along the coast . `` They included assorted ammunition , artillery shells , mortar shells and other items , '' a senior Air Force official told CNN . He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media .",Where did the blast occur ?,in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning
767,"CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Impeached former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who was arrested in December on charges of conspiracy and fraud , was indicted Thursday on 16 felony counts by a federal grand jury , the U.S. attorney 's office said . Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is facing such charges as racketeering , conspiracy and wire fraud . The 19-count indictment charges Blagojevich and some of his closest aides and advisers with a wide-ranging `` scheme to deprive the people of Illinois of honest government , '' according to a statement by the attorney 's office . Blagojevich , 52 , faces charges including racketeering , conspiracy , wire fraud and making false statements to investigators , according to the release . Three counts in the indictment are against the aides and advisers . In a written statement , Blagojevich maintained his innocence -- as he has done throughout a political soap opera that captivated the nation . `` I 'm saddened and hurt but I am not surprised by the indictment , '' he said . `` I am innocent . I now will fight in the courts to clear my name . '' Blagojevich was vacationing with his family in Florida on Thursday . In video shot at a Disney resort outside Orlando , Florida , by CNN affiliate WESH-TV , he declined to comment on his legal situation . He was filmed shortly before the indictments were handed down . In the WESH video , the ex-governor was sitting near a pool at the resort . `` I 'm enjoying Disney World with my kids and I do n't think you 're supposed to be here , '' said Blagojevich , after his wife attempted to shield him from the camera . `` I 'm happy to talk to you at the appropriate time . '' A man who identified himself only as `` someone who knows who he is '' then blocked the camera . U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , said he hoped the former governor would n't use the announcement as a reason to hit the media circuit again . `` We can only hope the former governor will not view this indictment as a green light for another publicity tour , '' he said . `` Rod Blagojevich deserves his day in court , but the people of Illinois deserve a break . '' Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris , were arrested in December on federal corruption charges alleging that , among other things , they conspired to sell President Obama 's vacant U.S. Senate seat . Harris and Blagojevich 's brother , Robert Blagojevich , were among the others indicted on Thursday . In early January , federal Judge James Holderman gave the attorney 's office three additional months to decide whether to indict Blagojevich , who was impeached by the state legislature and resigned from office . That deadline ends Tuesday . On Thursday , current Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn called the charges a reminder for political leaders in the state to help stamp out corruption , and he pledged to `` work night and day to clean up our government . '' `` Today , more than ever , I 'm committed to making sure our government has fundamental reform from top to bottom , '' said Quinn , also a Democrat and the former lieutenant governor who was appointed governor in January . `` We need to overhaul Illinois government to make sure everything is done right for the people . '' The charges are part of what investigators have dubbed `` Operation Board Games , '' an ongoing investigation into political corruption in the state . Among the specific claims in the 75-page indictment are that Blagojevich schemed with others in 2002 , even before he took office , to use his position to make money , which they would split after he left office . Blagojevich is accused of denying state business to companies that would not hire his wife , extorting campaign contributions from a children 's hospital that was set to get state money and pressuring a racetrack executive to give political contributions before the governor signed a gambling bill . The indictment said that after Obama was elected president , Blagojevich began meeting with others to figure out a way he could make money from his position to appoint a replacement senator . It said Blagojevich asked others , including state employees , to contact people who may be interested in the seat , and that he believed an associate of someone referred to in the indictment as `` Senate Candidate A '' had offered $ 1.5 million in campaign contributions in exchange for the appointment . He had asked his brother to meet with an associate of `` Senate Candidate A '' and say that some of those contributions needed to come through before he made the appointment , but the meeting was canceled after a newspaper article reported that Blagojevich had been recorded talking about selling the seat . A lengthy FBI affidavit alleges that Blagojevich was intercepted on court-authorized wiretaps trying to profit from the Senate vacancy . The indictment said that Blagojevich communicated `` directly and with the assistance of others '' with people he believed were in contact with Obama , trying to gain political favor by possibly appointing someone the president-elect supported . He ultimately appointed a former state comptroller and attorney general , Roland Burris , who was seated in the Senate despite protests from the chamber 's Democratic leaders . Those leaders said a special election should be called because of the controversy over the appointment . `` The U.S. Attorney 's indictment serves to confirm the public 's long-standing distrust of former Gov. Blagojevich and his administration , and it underscores the culture of corruption that has afflicted our state for far too long , '' state Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a written statement . `` While this is a terrible day in Illinois history , it is also a moment in which we can recognize an opportunity for real reform . '' Thursday 's charges supersede the ones filed in December . The Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in January to impeach Blagojevich , accusing him of abusing his gubernatorial power . Blagojevich faces up to 20 years in prison for each of the 15 most serious charges in the indictment , and five years on a single indictment of making false statements . The government also charges that Blagojevich has bought property with money he got illegally , and is going after homes he owns in Chicago and Washington . `` I would ask the good people of Illinois to wait for the trial and afford me the presumption of innocence that they would give to all their friends and neighbors , '' Blagojevich , who was vacationing with his family , said in the statement . In addition to the Blagojevich brothers and Harris , also charged in the indictments were businessman and fundraiser Christopher Kelly , 50 ; lobbyist and longtime Blagojevich associate Alonzo Monk , 50 ; and William F. Cellini Sr. , 74 , another businessman who raised money for Blagojevich .",What are some of the charges against Blagojevich ?,conspiracy and fraud
768,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Events commemorating the bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie were taking place Sunday in both the UK and the U.S. to mark the 20th anniversary of the attack which killed 270 people . Mourners gathered at a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday to mark the Lockerbie bombing . All 259 people on board Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York were killed when the plane exploded in midair on December 21 , 1988 . A further 11 people died on the ground as debris rained down on Lockerbie . In Scotland , mourners watched as a commemorative wreath was laid at Dryfesdale Cemetery , the site of a permanent memorial and remembrance garden to the victims of the attack . Canon Michael Bands , who led the service , said that the disaster had `` long ceased to be a Lockerbie event and become a world event . '' `` It is awful that we should gather today on this stormy sort of day to feel the sadness again of the tragedy that took place here 20 years ago , '' Bands said , according to the UK 's Press Association . Services marking the exact time of the attack at 1903 GMT were also due to take place later in local churches . A private service for relatives of victims and former Pan Am employees will also take place at London 's Heathrow airport , where the airliner began its final flight . In the U.S. , remembrance services were scheduled to take place at Arlington National Cemetery and at New York 's Syracuse University , which lost 35 students in the bombing . Scotland 's First Minister Alex Salmond said the anniversary marked an opportunity to reflect on `` the lasting links that have been established with those in other nations who were touched by the disaster . '' `` I know that through the events being organised in Lockerbie , at Syracuse University , and at other locations in the UK and the U.S. , that fitting tribute will be paid to those who so tragically lost their lives and those , in the south of Scotland and beyond , whose lives have been affected by the atrocity . '' A former Libyan intelligence officer , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi , was convicted of the bombing in 2001 . Al Megrahi , who is serving a life sentence in Scotland 's Greenock Prison , last month lost an appeal to be released because he is suffering from advanced prostate cancer . Al Megrahi has always denied any involvement in the bombing . He was convicted after prosecutors argued he had placed the bomb , hidden in a suitcase , on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt , Germany . There , prosecutors said , the bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am jet that went first to London 's Heathrow Airport and then was to continue to New York . The prosecution maintained that Megrahi , who worked at Malta 's Luqa Airport , was an agent for the Libyan intelligence services and had been seen buying clothes that were in the suitcase that contained the bomb . In 2007 Scottish judges granted Megrahi the right to make a second appeal against his conviction on grounds that he may have suffered a miscarriage of justice . That process is ongoing . Another man -- Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima -- was also tried in the bombing but was acquitted . Libya has formally accepted responsibility for the bombing , though Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi later denied any culpability . The north African country has paid out more than $ 500 million to the families of victims of the attack as part of a wider $ 1.5 billion settlement to end its legal liability in U.S. terrorism cases and restore diplomatic full relations with Washington .",Where are the services to be held ?,"take place at Arlington National Cemetery and at New York 's Syracuse University , which lost 35 students in the bombing"

Chad President Idriss Deby , right , and Sudan 's President Omar al-Beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . The signing came after nearly two full days of talks in Dakar , Senegal , between Sudan President Omar al-Beshir and Idriss Deby , the president of Chad . Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade facilitated the talks , and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` The idea is to get the governments of Sudan and Chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said United Nations spokesman Farhan Haq . Each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . The rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . The United Nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled Darfur region of Sudan and Chad . They allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked N'Djamena , the capital of Chad , in early February . As recently as Thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , Chad issued a communique saying rebels from Sudan had crossed the border . Chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow Deby 's regime . The United Nations says the swelling number of Darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern Chad is causing serious strain on the region . Kingsley Amaning , the U.N. 's humanitarian coordinator for Chad , said more than 10,000 people from Darfur , in Sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern Chad . They join some 240,000 Darfurians who have lived in Chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced Chadians also living there . The number of displaced Chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , Kingsley said . Haq said the United Nations , which has peacekeeping troops in the Darfur region , will work to assure Sudan and Chad carry out the terms of Thursday 's deal .

Tom Daschle will be announced Thursday as President-elect Barack Obama 's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , a Democratic source said Wednesday . Former Sen. Tom Daschle , shown with his wife , Linda , says he will write Obama 's health care plan . CNN has previously reported that the 61-year-old former Senate majority leader from South Dakota would be Obama 's choice , but not the announcement date . In November , Daschle said he was excited about the possibility of serving as point person in Obama 's effort to change the nation 's health care system . Daschle is on the health care advisory group of Obama 's transition team and said he plans to write the health care plan that Obama submits to Congress next year . `` I hope to have the plan enacted by next year , and then it will take several years to implement , '' Daschle said last month . Daschle said reforming health care in the United States must be a priority in the current economic climate . `` We ca n't afford not to do it , '' he said . `` If we do nothing , we 'll be paying twice as much on health care in 10 years as we do today . '' Daschle served as Democratic leader in the Senate from 1995 until he lost a re-election bid in 2004 . Representing South Dakota , he was first elected as a congressman in 1978 and served in the House until he was elected to the Senate in 1986 . He recently wrote a book on health care titled `` Critical : What We Can Do About the Health Care Crisis . '' In the book , he pushed for universal health care coverage to reach 46 million uninsured Americans by expanding the federal employee health benefits program to include private employer plans together with Medicaid and Medicare . Most Republicans oppose any such plan , saying it would give too much power to the government . They 've also questioned Daschle 's recent work for a Washington lobbying firm . His wife , Linda Daschle , is a registered lobbyist for a firm that includes health care clients . But a source close to Daschle told CNN that Linda Daschle would be leaving the firm at the end of the year to set up her own company focusing on transportation lobbying in order to clear any potential conflicts of interest .

772,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former `` enemy combatant '' who was held in a South Carolina Naval brig for six years with no charges was sentenced Thursday to eight years and four months in prison , a Justice Department spokesman said . Ali al-Marri pleaded guilty in federal court in Illinois in May to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization . He could have received a maximum of 15 years in prison . `` This administration is committed to bringing terrorists to justice for their crimes , '' Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said . `` Al-Marri , who has been in U.S. custody since December 2001 , was dispatched by the highest levels of al Qaeda to carry out its terrorist objectives in America . '' A defense attorney for the Qatari citizen , who had been a student at Bradley University in Peoria , Illinois , when he was arrested , said the judge ruled on a lesser sentence to reflect the nearly six years al-Marri already spent at the Naval brig in Charleston , South Carolina . `` We 're pleased with the result , '' said the attorney , Larry Lustberg . `` Mr. al-Marri is also very pleased . '' Al-Marri was transferred to a federal prison in Illinois in March after President Obama ordered a review of his case . The case was ultimately referred to the Justice Department , which filed charges . The Pentagon said he trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to court documents filed earlier in the case . According to a copy of his plea agreement , al-Marri admitted that he `` knowingly conspired and agreed with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed '' to provide support to al Qaeda and to work under the organization 's direction and control . `` Between 1998 and 2001 , the defendant attended various training camps because he wished to engage in jihad , '' the document said . While in the training camps and in al Qaeda safe houses in Pakistan , he was known by the name Abdul-Rahman al-Qatari , according to the plea agreement . Mohammed approached al-Marri in 2001 about his offer to assist al Qaeda , the plea agreement said . `` The defendant was instructed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to enter the United States no later than September 10 , 2001 , with an understanding that he was to remain in the United States for an undetermined length of time , '' the documents said . Al-Marri applied to Bradley using the same e-mail address he used to communicate with Mohammed , the plea agreement said . At Bradley , he `` rarely attended classes and was in a failing status by the end of his first semester . '' On September 21 , 2001 , al-Marri traveled to another central Illinois university and created five e-mail accounts under different aliases , the documents said . `` By this time , the defendant knew that al Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States and fully understood why Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had directed him to be in the United States before that date . '' He used the new e-mail accounts to inform Mohammed of his whereabouts and activities , and also gave him his cell phone number in encoded format , according to the plea agreement . In addition , he conducted online research `` related to various cyanide compounds . The defendant 's focus was on various cyanide substances ... the defendant reviewed toxicity levels , the locations where these items could be purchased , and specific pricing of the compounds , '' the documents said . He also explored obtaining sulfuric acid . An almanac found at al-Marri 's residence was bookmarked `` at pages showing dams , waterways and tunnels in the United States , '' the plea agreement said . Al-Marri initially was arrested on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 . But his continued confinement without charges mushroomed into a major legal case before federal prosecutors filed charges in February . The Supreme Court ruled on March 6 that al-Marri 's case was rendered moot by a decision to indict him on federal conspiracy charges , and granted the Obama administration 's request to dismiss his challenge of the president 's unilateral authority to detain him indefinitely without charges . He was transferred to civilian custody and taken to Illinois in March . The court 's ruling , however , meant that the larger constitutional issue of the president 's power to detain accused terrorists and other criminals in the United States remains unresolved .

The man , who was from around Salt Lake City , was between 18 and 25 years old and `` had chronic medical conditions that may have contributed to severe complications from influenza , '' said Gary Edwards , executive director of the Salt Lake Valley Health Department . Also on Wednesday , health and education officials in New York announced that 21 of the city 's public schools had been closed after an increase of reports of students with flu-like symptoms . A school administrator in Queens died after being hospitalized with the H1N1 virus , commonly called swine flu . Nineteen of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private , the city 's Education Department announced in a news release . In addition , two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms , according the schools ' Web sites . In the city 's news release , city Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden repeated what has become a familiar refrain : `` We continue to see a rising tide of flu in many parts of New York City . As the virus spreads , we will look to slow transmission within individual school communities by closing individual schools . '' Late last week the city closed 11 schools in Queens and one in Brooklyn after confirming cases of the virus at Intermediate School 238 in Queens and unusually high levels of flu-like symptoms in the others . Mitchell Wiener , an assistant principal at I.S. 238 who died Sunday after being hospitalized with the disease , had an underlying condition , according to Frieden . The death in Utah was the first associated with the swine flu , or H1N1 , virus . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has linked eight U.S. deaths to the flu outbreak , but had not confirmed a link to H1N1 in the Utah death as of Wednesday evening . The outbreak has sickened at least 10,176 people and caused at least 80 deaths -- mostly in Mexico , according to the World Health Organization . The actual number of people affected may be higher , as it takes time for national governments to confirm cases and report them to the global body . In the United States , at least 5,710 cases of swine flu have been reported , according to recent figures from the CDC . Utah officials echoed national agencies in saying that the swine flu has largely behaved like typical seasonal influenza , which usually is fatal only among the very old , the very young or people with other health problems . In New York , 19 of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private , it and the city 's Education Department announced in a news release . In addition , two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms , according the schools ' Web sites .

775,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis , who had a storied career in professional football as a coach , commissioner and owner , died Saturday , the team said . He was 82 . In a brief post on their website , the Raiders said a statement would be issued later in the day . The cause of death was not immediately released . Much of Davis ' career was spent in Oakland , where he first arrived as a coach in 1963 -- tasked with turning around a team that was picked to be at the bottom of the standings . The results were almost immediate , finishing 10-4 that season , and Davis was selected as coach of the year .

His career started in 1950 as a line coach at Adelphi College in New York , the Raiders website said . He also coached at The Citadel , Southern California and for the then-Los Angeles Chargers before going to the Raiders . According to the Raiders website , by the time he arrived in Oakland , Davis had already been labeled a `` young coaching genius '' by Sports Illustrated . As commissioner of the American Football League in 1966 , he played a role in the merger of that league with the National Football League .

777,"If you want to know where American food traditions are headed , look back . Many of today 's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday 's : Nearby farms offering nutritious , peak-of-season produce ; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals ; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods . Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , the USDA says . `` It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage . But today , food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest , most natural way possible , '' says Fern Gale Estrow , M.S. , R.D. , a community nutritionist based in New York City . `` People still want and need to save time in the kitchen , but they 're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it . '' Fortunately , these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful , nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements . Flexitarianism Like vegetarians , `` flexitarians '' eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains , vegetables , and fruits , but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat , fish , poultry , or dairy . A quarter of Americans fit the description , consuming meatless meals at least four days a week , according to the American Dietetic Association . Why it 's here to stay : Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians , nutritional researchers , and public health advocates have been recommending for years . `` It 's about eating a varied diet that 's low in saturated fat and high in fiber , '' says Milton Stokes , M.P.H. , R.D. , chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City , and an ADA spokesperson . Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein , flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain . CookingLight.com : Take our quiz on correct serving sizes What it means for you : Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension , heart disease , diabetes , and prostate and colon cancer . In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans , Louisiana , researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent , and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent . Locally grown foods As people seek fresher foods , they have begun to connect with local family farms . Community-supported agriculture -LRB- CSA -RRB- programs and farmers ' markets give consumers direct access to produce , meats , cheeses , breads , honey , and other foods that are produced in nearby communities . In the past 10 years , the number of local farmers ' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Marketing Service . Why it 's here to stay : Because they are so fresh , locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on `` factory '' farms . The latter , which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States , is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves , and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it 's sold , according to Local Harvest , a nonprofit agricultural research group . All that downtime takes a toll . USDA researchers have found that if it 's not handled properly , produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit . Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable . What it means for you : `` Buying food from local vendors gives you input , '' says Gail Feenstra , R.D. , food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis ' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program . `` You can find out how things were grown . You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that would n't be available elsewhere . '' And then there 's the most important reason of all : Because of its freshness , locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped . `` Growers ' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation , '' Feenstra says . Functional foods Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food . Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D . As sales of these foods have soared in recent years , more functional foods have reached the market , such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids , sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber , high-protein flours . Why it 's here to stay : These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps . `` For example , if you 're lactose intolerant , you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota , '' Stokes says . `` Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem , especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet . '' Likewise , if you dislike seafood , you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta . CookingLight.com : Remembering real portion sizes What it means for you : Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet , not a substitute for it . `` Calcium-fortified orange juice wo n't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide , like protein , '' Estrow says . `` That 's why it 's best to rely on whole foods , which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically . '' In the end , it 's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food , but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources . Organic food These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides , herbicides , and other chemicals used in traditional farming . Organic food is one of the country 's fastest-growing market segments ; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , according to the USDA 's Economic Research Service . Why it 's here to stay : Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost . A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that , on average , organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C , 21 percent more iron , and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods . The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category 's growth , such as cookies , baked goods , and boxed meals , also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness . What it means for you : `` An organic stamp is n't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality , but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated , '' Stokes says . An organic cookie , for example , may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie . But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides , such as peaches , apples , and strawberries , choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals , according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington , D.C. CookingLight.com : All-star foods that fight for health Slow food Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini , `` slow food '' was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle . The trend 's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items , preparing them in traditional ways , and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced , eat-on-the-run lives many people lead . Why it 's here to stay : As with locally grown food , freshness is a key component of the slow food trend . `` Investing the time to choose what 's fresh that day will ensure that night 's meal will be at its peak nutritionally , '' Stokes says . This principle applies whether you 're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability . Family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend . `` Slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be : a vehicle for drawing people together , '' explains Sara Firebaugh , assistant director of Slow Food USA . What it means for you : Healthful whole foods are a great start , but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it 's a difficult one to quantify . No scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions , but the benefits are clear . `` Slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices , meal preparation , and the act of eating , '' Estrow says . `` A healthful diet is n't just about what you eat but how you eat it .

778,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Massachusetts sued the U.S. government on Wednesday , challenging the constitutionality of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman . The state of Massachusetts says the Defense of Marriage Act denies same-sex couples essential rights . `` We 're taking this action today because , first , we believe that -LSB- the Defense of Marriage Act -RSB- directly interferes with Massachusetts ' long-standing sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents , '' Attorney General Martha Coakley said Wednesday afternoon . `` Massachusetts has a single category of married persons , and we view all married persons equally and identically , '' she said . `` DOMA divides that category into two distinct and unequal classes of marriage . '' The lawsuit argues that the act , which became law in 1996 , denies same-sex couples essential rights and protections , including federal income tax credits , employment and retirement benefits , health insurance coverage and Social Security payments . `` In enacting DOMA , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , '' the state wrote in the lawsuit , which was filed Wednesday in federal court . Massachusetts , the first state to legalize gay marriage , said that about 16,000 same-sex couples have been married there since 2004 , when it began issuing marriage licenses . Since that time , the lawsuit said , `` the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . '' The state is challenging Section 3 of the law , which defines marriage as `` a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife '' and a spouse as `` a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife . '' Before the act , the lawsuit argues , defining marital status was the prerogative of the states . The law `` eviscerated more than 200 years of federal government deference to the states with respect to defining marriage , '' it said . The lawsuit also argues that the law forces Massachusetts to treat same-sex married couples differently from heterosexual married couples , particularly through determining who qualifies for the state 's Medicaid program , known as MassHealth , and whether a same-sex spouse of a veteran can be buried in a veteran cemetery . `` But for DOMA , married individuals in same-sex relationships in the commonwealth would receive the same status , obligations , responsibilities , rights , and protections as married individuals in different-sex relationships under local , state , and federal laws , '' the lawsuit said . The defendants named in the lawsuit include the Department of Health and Human Services , Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , the Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the United States itself . Charles Miller , a spokesman for the Department of Justice , said the department will review the case but noted that President Obama supports the legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act . In March , Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- also sued the federal government over Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act . Besides Massachusetts , three other states recognize same-sex marriages : Connecticut , Maine , and Iowa . Vermont and New Hampshire will join their company when same-sex marriages become legal later this year and early next year .",What does the measure define ?,marriage as the union of a man and a woman
779,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The State Department condemned Iran 's persecution of religious minorities on Friday following the Iranian authorities ' detention of Baha'is and Christians in recent months . Iranian authorities have detained more than 45 Baha'is in the last four months , and as many as 60 Baha'is are imprisoned in Iran on the basis of their religion beliefs , the State Department said . Iranians have also recently detained more than a dozen Christians , according to the State Department . `` The United States is increasingly concerned about the Iran 's ongoing persecution of Baha'is and other religious minority communities , '' said Philip J. Crowley , assistant secretary for public affairs , in a statement on Friday . The State Department 's condemnation comes a day after it released a human rights report on Iran that blasted the country 's government for abusing religious minorities , among other criticisms . `` Government rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shia religious groups , most notably for Baha'is , as well as for Sunni Muslims , evangelical Christians , and members of the Jewish community , '' Thursday 's report said . Iran is an Islamic Republic where Shia Islam is the state religion . The Iranian government did not respond directly to the State Department on Thursday or Friday . However , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad criticized the West on Friday for ignoring religious principles like monotheism . At a meeting with Iranian intellectuals , `` the president stressed that -LSB- many -RSB- efforts should be made to ... promote justice and support -LSB- a -RSB- campaign against oppressors and help monotheism flourish , '' Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency reported . Thursday 's State Department report said that Iran 's government prevents Baha'is from gathering in homes to worship and bans Baha'is from public schools , universities , the social pension system and government leadership posts unless they conceal their faith . `` The government repeatedly pressured Baha'is to recant their religious beliefs in exchange for relief from mistreatment , '' the report said . All seven members of Iran 's Baha'i national leadership body , who were arrested in 2008 , remained in prison at the end of 2009 , according to the report . The Baha'i faith was founded in Iran in the 19th century . Today , Baha'is are the country 's largest religious minority , with 300,000 members , according to the official Baha'i Web site . Thursday 's State Department report also accused the Iranian government of destroying a Sufi library and religious hall in Isfahan ; demolishing several Sunni mosques ; and requiring evangelical Christian groups to submit congregation membership lists to the government . The report was part of a broader State Department release of human rights reports on 194 countries .",What is the concern of the State Department ?,about the Iran 's ongoing persecution of Baha'is and other religious minority communities
780,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi had been on the run for months , as opposition fighters aided by NATO airstrikes pushed him and his supporters from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and other long-time strongholds . Finally , on Thursday , the long-time Libyan leader 's life ended around where it began -- in Sirte , the coastal city where he was born . Here is a timeline of some key moments leading up to Gadhafi 's death , according to Libya 's interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , other National Transitional Council officials and other sources : -- Having taken over the city of Bani Walid earlier in the week , fighters aligned with Libya 's National Transitional Council turn their attention on Sirte -- the last holdout of Gadhafi loyalists . -- French fighter jets and a Predator drone , firing a Hellfire missile , strike a convoy near Sirte on Thursday morning , a U.S. Defense official says . That official is unable to say if Gadhafi was in the targeted envoy . But a senior NATO official says that Gadhafi was part of that convoy and survived the attack . -- Around noon on Thursday , transitional council officials announce that their fighters have taken control of Sirte , despite pockets of resistance . There is no official word then about Gadhafi . -- During the day Thursday , Gadhafi is captured alive and in good health in Sirte , according to the interim prime minster . -- According to Ali Aujali , Libya 's ambassador to the United States , troops find Gadhafi during the day in a large drainage pipe in Sirte . Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte later tells CNN 's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand . -- Gadhafi is alive and in good health when he 's captured , according to the interim prime minster . -- He does not resist arrest . -- At the time , he is wearing an undershirt and trousers and carrying a gun . -- While being transferred to a vehicle -- destined for Misrata , Jibril says later -- Gadhafi is shot in the right arm . -- Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks shows a bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi being hauled onto a truck . -- Eventually , National Transitional Council forces put Gadhafi into the vehicle . As soon as it takes off , a firefight erupts involving council forces and those loyal to Gadhafi . -- Caught in the crossfire , Gadhafi is shot in the head . -- He dies a few moments before arriving at a hospital , a coroner says , according to Jibril . Another video shows a dead Gadhafi with what appears to be a head wound . -- At the hospital , DNA samples are taken -- including blood and saliva -- that confirm that the dead man is indeed Moammar Gadhafi . -- Council representatives get in touch with the International Criminal Court , which had charged Gadhafi with war crimes . After sending the coroner 's report and photos , the court gives Libyan authorities permission to bury Gadhafi . -- Soon after the news breaks on Thursday afternoon , crowds throughout Libya erupt in celebration of Gadhafi 's death .",what dna tests says,confirm that the dead man is indeed Moammar Gadhafi
781,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Qatari man held for years in military custody in the United States was charged Friday in federal court with conspiracy `` to provide material support and resources '' to al Qaeda , prosecutors announced . Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001 . The Supreme Court was to hear arguments in April on a challenge by the suspect , Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri , to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges . The Justice Department on Friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal . `` Because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended , no live controversy remains in this case , '' said Obama administration lawyers in their brief . Al-Marri 's lawyers oppose such a move , saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered . The federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution . Andy Savage , one of al-Marri 's lawyers , visited him at the naval brig in North Charleston , South Carolina , on Friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism . `` He denies it , '' Savage said . `` I 'm sure he 'll enter a not guilty plea . '' Savage said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment . `` We 'd like information about what he 's supposed to have done , '' he said . `` You 'd think after 7 1/2 years they 'd have a little more to say . `` The most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future . Before , he did n't know if he 'd be charged , be repatriated or held forever . '' The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining `` enemy combatant '' held in the United States . He had been accused of being an al Qaeda sleeper agent , but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense . He will be transferred at some point to Peoria , Illinois , to face a criminal trial . Oral arguments in the case are scheduled April 27 . A Justice Department official said the White House will release an official presidential order to transfer al-Marri into civilian custody . Al-Marri 's lawyer applauded the move . `` This indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts . This case is now finally where it belongs : in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether Mr. al-Marri is guilty of a crime , '' said Jonathan Hafetz , an ACLU attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal . President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the `` factual and legal basis '' for the continued detention of al-Marri . Obama late Friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to facilitate al-Marri 's transfer , calling it `` in the interest of the United States . '' Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001 , al-Marri , a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States , has remained in `` virtual isolation in the brig , '' his attorneys said . They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention . They said his cell at the brig in South Carolina is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world , including his family . Military officials deny mistreatment . The case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations . President George W. Bush ordered al-Marri confined in military custody , and the Bush Justice Department had been filing the appeals opposing al-Marri 's legal claims . At issue was whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force , passed by Congress after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil . Al-Marri arrived in the United States the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria . He had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier . Weeks later , he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home . At an early court hearing , a prosecutor said al-Marri was believed to be an associate of al Qaeda , the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks . The case against al-Marri escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated al Qaeda detainees , the government said . Although al-Marri was not charged with terrorism-related offenses , Bush in June 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an `` enemy combatant '' and transferring him to military custody . That move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention . The declaration alleges al-Marri engaged in `` hostile and warlike acts '' working as an `` al Qaeda sleeper agent '' who was planning to `` hack into the computer systems of U.S banks , '' for a possible follow-up to the 9/11 attacks . The Pentagon said he had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan , met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and `` volunteered for a martyr mission , '' according to the government 's filing with the high court . A lawyer for Jose Padilla , an American citizen detained as an enemy combatant , said the government 's actions in the al-Marri case echo those in Padilla 's , in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the Supreme Court . `` This is deja vu all over again -- what the Bush administration did with Padilla , the Obama administration is trying to do with al-Marri , '' he said . `` Transferring al-Marri out of the brig is the right thing to do . Moving to dismiss the case is not . '' The case is U.S. v. al-Marri -LRB- 09-CR-10030 -RRB- .

782,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man on trial for gunning down a Kansas abortion provider in church said he had no regrets because `` abortion is murder . '' Scott Roeder , 51 , said he shot and killed Dr. George Tiller as services began on May 31 to save the lives of the unborn . `` There was nothing being done and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , '' Roeder said . `` I did what I thought was needed to be done to protect the children . '' Roeder is charged with one count of first-degree murder for the death of Tiller , who ran a women 's clinic in Wichita where abortions were performed , including the controversial late-term procedure . Roeder was the only witness for the defense , which rested its case Thursday . Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert told jurors closing arguments will be held Friday morning , depending on the weather . After the jury left , Wilbert ruled that the jury could not consider convicting Roeder of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter , which is defined as `` an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force '' under Kansas statute . Wilbert said testimony did not support the defense claim that Roeder 's beliefs on abortion justified the use of deadly force against Tiller . Tiller , 67 , was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions . He had already survived one attempt on his life and a clinic bombing before he was slain . During Roeder 's testimony Thursday , Tiller 's widow , Jeanne , and other family members sat in the gallery . Initially stoic , they began to dab at tears as Roeder described putting a gun to Tiller 's head . Asked if he regretted what he did , Roeder said , `` No , I do n't . '' Upon learning that Tiller 's clinic was shut down after his death , he said he felt `` a sense of relief . '' Dressed in a dark suit , white shirt and a red patterned tie , Roeder calmly testified that he had a long-standing belief that Tiller should die . He thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into him , perhaps , or shooting him with a rifle . His main concern , Roeder said , was that he might harm others . Under cross-examination by Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston , he said he also considered cutting Tiller 's hands off with a sword , but decided that would not be effective , as Tiller would still be able to train others . Roeder said that through the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue he learned that Tiller took measures to protect himself -- traveling in an armored car , using a security escort , wearing a bulletproof vest and living in a gated community . He decided to kill Tiller at his church , he said , because `` I felt that actually if he was to be stopped , that was probably the only place he could have been stopped . ... It was the only window of opportunity I saw . '' Roeder said he visited the church four or five times before Tiller 's death . The week before the shooting , on May 24 , he carried a .22 - caliber handgun with him , he testified , but Tiller did not attend church that day . On May 31 , though , the doctor was greeting congregants in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church before Roeder walked up to him and shot him at point blank range . `` The lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop George Tiller , '' Roeder said . `` I shot him . '' Under questioning from Foulston , Roeder acknowledged that he `` somewhat '' admired those who previously had committed violence against abortion providers . He said his anti-abortion beliefs '' go hand in hand '' with his religious beliefs . He said he became born again in 1992 after watching an episode of `` The 700 Club . '' Asked if there are any circumstances in which he believes abortion is acceptable , Roeder said he thought it could be if the mother 's life was in `` absolute '' danger . `` I struggle with that decision , '' he said , `` because I believe that ultimately , it is up to our heavenly father . But if there was a time , that would be it . '' He said he did not believe abortion was justified in the case of rape . `` You are taking the life of the innocent . You 're punishing the innocent life for the sin of the father . Two wrongs do n't make a right . '' Asked about incest , he said his beliefs were the same : `` It is n't our duty to take life , it 's our heavenly father 's . '' Roeder 's testimony was peppered with objections from prosecutors . Many objections were sustained by Wilbert , who has maintained he does not want the trial to become a forum on abortion . In a conference out of the presence of jurors , Wilbert cautioned Roeder , saying specifics on medical procedures would not be allowed . Roeder 's testimony would proceed , Wilbert said , `` on a question-by-question basis . '' Roeder recounted conducting what he called `` sidewalk counseling '' at Kansas City abortion clinics , handing pamphlets and other literature to women as they went inside . `` Some of them did ultimately change their mind , '' he said . In opening statements Thursday , defense attorney Steve Osburn told jurors Roeder `` killed Dr. Tiller because he believed that was the only way , necessary to save the lives of the unborn . '' Defense attorneys claim Roeder was also motivated by authorities ' failure to punish him through the judicial system . Wilbert refused to allow former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline to testify on behalf of the defense . On Wednesday , he refused to allow testimony from current Deputy Attorney General Barry Disney . Kline unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute Tiller in 2006 . Disney charged Tiller with 19 misdemeanor counts , but a jury acquitted the doctor . Wilbert said Roeder can testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs , but to allow testimony from Kline would `` get into legal matters that do not concern this jury . '' And , the judge said , the cases do not give Roeder a basis to state absolutely that Tiller 's actions were illegal , since the doctor had never been convicted . Roeder testified he was `` very frustrated '' by Tiller 's acquittal , saying it `` seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of Kansas to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in George Tiller 's clinic . '' Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue , told reporters outside the courtroom the trial is `` a railroad , a kangaroo court , where they are denying critical evidence about what was on Scott Roeder 's mind when he pulled the trigger . '' `` Perhaps if the Sedgwick County prosecutors had done a better job prosecuting Tiller for how he illegally killed babies , he would still be alive , '' Terry said .",Where did he gain this view,go hand in hand '' with his religious beliefs
783,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former college and pro football star Charles Aaron `` Bubba '' Smith , who went on to an acting career after his retirement from sports , was found dead at his home , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said Wednesday . He was 66 . Police and fire officials were called to Smith 's home after `` he was found unresponsive '' and pronounced him dead , said Ed Winter , assistant chief of operations and investigation for the coroner . An autopsy will be performed to determine cause of death , Winter said . However , asked if there was any reason to believe the death was due to anything other than natural causes , he replied , `` Not at this time . '' An imposing 6 foot 8 and 260 pounds , Smith was considered one of the most fearsome pass rushers of his day . The No. 1 overall pick in the 1967 National Football League draft , he played nine seasons in the NFL -- for the Baltimore Colts , Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers . Sports Illustrated gallery : The NFL goes Hollywood He played for the Colts in two Super Bowls and was also a two-time Pro Bowl pick . Smith was one of the anchors of an overwhelming defense that was heavily favored to win Super Bowl III . Nonetheless , the New York Jets , led by Joe Namath , defeated the Colts in the 1969 championship of pro football , widely considered one of the biggest upsets in U.S. sports history . The Colts atoned for that embarrassment -- somewhat -- two years later in a 16-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V , but Smith reportedly said he was so dismayed by the game 's sloppiness that he never wore his Super Bowl ring . Smith was sidelined by a severe knee injury during an exhibition game in 1972 , and the next season joined the Raiders . He told Sports Illustrated in 1973 that `` not playing was terrible . I did n't want to show my face in public . I do n't know if it was that we were losing or what , but it almost drove me crazy . '' After retiring from pro football in 1975 , Smith landed small roles on TV series such as '' Good Times , '' `` Charlie 's Angels '' and '' Semi-Tough , '' according to IMDb , before landing his signature role as Lt. Moses Hightower in the first `` Police Academy '' movie in 1984 . He reprised the role in all six movies in the popular comedy franchise . Smith was a two-time All-America defensive end at Michigan State University . He played in what the national media dubbed `` the game of the century '' between Michigan State and Notre Dame in 1966 , a 10-10 tie that resulted in the two teams ' splitting the vote for that year 's national championship . Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988 , an event he called `` the jewel in my crown , for my collegiate days were very special to me . '' Smith was born on February 28 , 1945 , in Beaumont Texas . His father was a high school football coach and his mother had earned two college degrees .

784,"TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes , Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday during the first visit to the country by a Kremlin leader since 1943 . Putin , right , is greeted by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad following his arrival in Tehran . Putin , who is in Tehran to attend a summit of Caspian Sea nations , said that he and the other leaders agreed that `` peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed '' in the region . `` The Iranians are cooperating with Russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives , '' he said . Russia is building Iran 's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the U.S. and its allies to impose stronger U.N. sanctions against Tehran . On Monday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated the Bush administration 's stance that `` all options '' must be kept `` on the table '' in confronting the threats posed by Iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time U.S. adversary . `` We should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program , their willingness to live up to their rhetoric , their intentions for Iraq , or their ambitions in the Gulf region , '' Gates said in a speech to the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs . The leaders of Iran , Russia , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also met Tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the Caspian Sea -- the world 's largest inland body of water . Speaking afterwards , Putin said that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the U.S. planned to use Azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against Iran , The Associated Press reported . `` We are saying that no Caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any Caspian state , '' Putin said . `` The Caspian Sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the Caspian states , therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here , '' added Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Putin , defying reports of an assassination plot against him , was greeted by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as he stepped off his plane at Tehran 's Mehrabad Airport . During a news conference Monday after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Wiesbaden , Germany , Putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans . `` Of course I will travel to Iran , '' Putin said . `` If I reacted to these kinds of rumors every time , I could never leave the house . '' Iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against Putin , with a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the Putin visit baseless . `` Spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and can not damage the trend of the prepared programs , '' spokesman Mohammadali Hosseini told the Iranian FARS news agency . Hosseini blamed the rumor on Western media , particularly the U.S. media , saying the report was `` made up by the enemies of relations between Iran and Russia to create a psychological war . '' Putin 's visit is the first by a leader in the Kremlin to Iran since Joseph Stalin 's World War II conference meeting with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . `` Putin 's trip to Tehran is a show of Russia 's independence in global affairs . Putin , who approaches the end of his term , wants to demonstrate that he would n't cave in to the U.S. pressure , '' said Alexander Pikayev , an expert on Iran with Russia 's Institute for World Economy and International Relations , in a report carried by AP . Putin 's schedule also includes meetings with Ahmadinejad and Iran 's supreme leader , Ali Khamenei , AP said .

787,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama will announce the U.S. troop strategy for Afghanistan in a speech at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , New York , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday . In the speech , Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan , its interests there and his decision-making process , Gibbs said , but `` the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement . `` Our time there will be limited , and I think that 's important for people to understand , '' he said . `` We are in year nine '' in Afghanistan , Gibbs told reporters . `` We 're not going to be there another eight or nine years . '' Obama will meet with members of Congress at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before the speech . Cost issues are among the topics the president will address , Gibbs said . `` It 's a million dollars a troop for a year , '' he said . `` Ten thousand troops is $ 10 billion . That 's in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan . That also does not include training , and it does n't include the maintaining of a security force . It 's very , very , very expensive . '' But , Gibbs added , `` I think the president , throughout this process , has talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our treasury , and I think he 'll continue to talk about it . '' The president ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March . Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban , the Islamic militia originally ousted by U.S. military action in 2001 . Obama has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent , ranging from sending a few thousand troops to the 40,000 McChrystal requested . A defense official told CNN earlier this week the Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of Obama 's decision on the 8-year-old war . There had been no final word on Obama 's decision as of Tuesday , said the Defense Department official , who has direct knowledge of the process . But the official said planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan with the expectation that Obama was leaning toward approving that many . iReporters sound off ; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive the paperwork Thursday to approve orders to deploy 1,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , to Afghanistan in late December -- the first of the new troops to be sent , a U.S. military official told CNN on Wednesday . The official is not authorized to talk about the plans because they have not been officially announced . The 1,000 Marines are part of a battalion task force that has been preparing and training for the deployment , the official said . The president held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night , and he told reporters Tuesday that he would announce new plans for Afghanistan after Thanksgiving . McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday , along with Vice President Joe Biden , Gates , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry , the U.S. ambassador in Kabul , Afghanistan . Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations had been `` comprehensive and extremely useful . '' `` It 's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there -LSB- in Afghanistan -RSB- , you 've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts , '' he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . The defense official said Tuesday that the military is planning to send three U.S. Army brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 ; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops . CNN reported last month that this was the Pentagon 's preferred option . However , the official said Wednesday that the Marines are expected to deploy 8,000 combat , aviation and support troops , plus 1,000 to 1,500 Marines as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500 . They will be in addition to the 11,000 Marines already in Afghanistan . After the first deployment , the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months , the military official said . The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces , where much of the recent fighting has taken place . Currently , brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those next in line to deploy . About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan , along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance . Two U.S. military officials have told CNN that NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wants . The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance 's headquarters in Brussels , Belgium . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brussels next week to meet with allies , State Department sources told CNN . Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers , but he said NATO would be asked for additional help . Obama 's Afghanistan plan will include `` very broad terms '' that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation , a senior U.S. military official told CNN . Those points will be used to determine how and when troops can be brought home . Another senior military official said McChrystal will take his orders from Obama and will do the best he can with what he has . The question , he said , is not the number of troops , but is whether the United States has `` the right resources to do what we need to do . '' `` We ca n't just go and blow people up and win this war , '' the official said . `` We have to gain the trust of the people , and that is a major part of the plan here . '' U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington . The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory -- but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught . Taliban fighters have since regrouped to the mountainous region along Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan , battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other . Al Qaeda 's top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region .

788,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States , prosecutors said Tuesday . Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb . Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws . Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said . Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals . Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes . Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration . Lawson and Ogren had neither . `` These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , '' said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent . `` This particular animal tested negative , '' he said . Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , `` but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . '' Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States . The journal also described the pair 's `` acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , '' McDevitt 's office said . Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant . `` The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , '' the statement from McDevitt 's office said . Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife . He will be sentenced in January . Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 . The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release . Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane , Washington , to Bangkok on November 4-5 , 2007 , with stops in Seattle , Washington , and Inchon , South Korea . They returned on a direct flight from Bangkok to Los Angeles , California , on November 28 , 2007 .",What was Lawson convicted of ?,smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws
789,"The Hague , Netherlands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors in the long-awaited war crimes trial of Radovan Karadzic said they will push ahead Tuesday , though the Bosnian Serb leader is expected to be a no-show once again . On Monday -- the opening day of the trial -- the court was forced to adjourn after Karadzic refused to appear , saying he did not have enough time to prepare . Karadzic , who is accused of masterminding the worst massacre in Europe since World War II , is representing himself . '' Obviously , it is the court 's preference for Karadzic to attend , '' said Nerma Jelacic , spokeswoman for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . `` But if he chooses not to attend , then some facility will be provided to him to allow him to watch the court 's proceedings from his prison cell . '' The court can not force a defendant to appear . Karadzic , as a `` self-representing accused , '' is the only one who can cross-examine witnesses and speak in court about the substance of the charges against him . However , judges can impose a lawyer on Karadzic if he continues to refuse to cooperate . Karadzic faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity against Bosnian Muslims , Bosnian Croats and other non-Serbian civilians during the brutal and bloody dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s . Bosnia and Herzegovina were a part of Yugoslavia at the time . The conflict introduced the phrase `` ethnic cleansing '' into the lexicon describing war crimes , as different factions in multi-ethnic Yugoslavia sought to kill or drive out other groups . Karadzic was arrested last year after more than a decade on the run and was found to have been living in Belgrade , the capital of Serbia , and practicing alternative medicine in disguise . In a letter dated Wednesday and made public Thursday , Karadzic complained to the International Criminal Tribunal that he had not received the relevant case material on time . He also said there was too much material to go through , even had he received it promptly . `` I ask Your Excellencies -- why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to literally bury me under a million of pages , only to start disclosing relevant material many months after my arrest ? '' he wrote . `` Why and how is it possible that the prosecution is allowed to file its final indictment against me on the eve of the planned trial date ? '' He promised to continue his preparations in `` the most intensive way '' and inform the court when he is ready . The genocide charges against Karadzic stem partly from killings in Srebrenica , the most notorious massacre of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Memories of the massacre remain raw . Watch the video Prosecutors at the U.N. war crimes tribunal accuse Karadzic of responsibility . `` On 8 March 1995 , Karadzic instructed Bosnian Serb forces under his command to create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival for the inhabitants of Srebrenica , amongst other places , '' the tribunal said in a statement this month . The Hague indictment also said Karadzic committed genocide when forces under his command killed non-Serbs during and after attacks in more than a dozen Bosnian municipalities early in the war . Karadzic , who faces life in prison if he is convicted , denies the charges . The court can not impose the death penalty . The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic , Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations . Karadzic was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office . Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague .",What did the Court spokeswoman say ?,"Obviously , it is the court 's preference for Karadzic to attend"
790,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The current debate over controversial interrogation practices -- tactics that some say constitute torture -- is rooted in the early years of the fight against terrorism and the Iraq war . The photographs from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq sparked outrage across the globe . After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States , the Bush administration crafted the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques of prisoners and terrorism suspects . The techniques included keeping the prisoner in stress positions for extended periods of time , sleep deprivation , slapping , enclosing the prisoner in a box with insects , and waterboarding , which simulates drowning . Those techniques were detailed in four Bush-era legal memos -- one from 2002 and three from 2005 -- released by the Obama administration last month . The memos concluded that such techniques did not constitute torture and were not illegal . See timeline of events '' The Obama administration disagrees . President Obama formally banned the techniques by issuing an executive order requiring that the U.S. Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations . `` I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture , '' he said during an address to a joint session of Congress in February . More than 400 people have been disciplined based on investigations involving detainee abuse , according to Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman . He said the punishments have ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand . `` The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat prisoners humanely , and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined , '' he said . The most notorious of the cases centered on Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq . In 2004 , images leaked to the media showed U.S. troops abusing Iraqi prisoners . Some prisoners were stacked atop each other while naked , and others were being threatened by dogs . See disturbing images from Abu Ghraib -LRB- discretion advised -RRB- '' One widely disseminated photograph showed an Iraqi prisoner hooded and wired , as if an electrocution were about to take place . Eleven American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses , and some officers were reprimanded . Some received prison sentences . Janis Karpinski , a brigadier general and commander of the prison during the time the photographs were taken , was demoted to colonel . She was eventually rotated out of Iraq . The prison was shut down in September 2006 . Karpinksi , now retired , said the recent disclosures have validated her earlier claims that she and her troops were following orders and that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not simply the work of a few `` bad apples , '' as once described by then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . See gallery of key players '' `` That is what we have been saying from the very beginning , that , wait a minute , why are you inside pointing the finger at me ? Why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here ? There 's a bigger story here , '' Karpinski said . `` I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations , but I read the memorandums many times over , '' she added . `` Waterboarding is torture . '' Other recent disclosures of harsh interrogation tactics have also raised questions . One Bush-era memo -- dated May 30 , 2005 , and recently released by the Obama administration -- said CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects . The technique was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah , according to the memo . Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- said to be the mastermind of the September 11 attacks -- 183 times in March 2003 , the memo said . Obama said last week that he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos , and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned . `` Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time , '' Obama said in a statement . `` This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States . '' However , Obama recently reversed course on the court-ordered release of hundreds of additional images said to show abuse in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq . He argued that the photos could `` inflame anti-American opinion '' and have `` a chilling effect '' on further investigations of detainee abuse . The photos `` are not particularly sensational , especially when compared to the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib , '' he said last week . The Obama administration said last month that it would not object to the release of the photos . The images are from more than 60 criminal investigations into detainee abuse between 2001 through 2006 , Pentagon officials said . The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union . `` Essentially , by withholding these photographs from public view , the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration 's torture policies , '' ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said . Bush-era officials , especially former Vice President Dick Cheney , have defended the controversial interrogation tactics , arguing that they helped provide valuable information in the fight against terrorism and other conflicts . `` I know specifically of reports that I read , '' Cheney told Fox News last month , `` that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country . '' The Obama administration `` did n't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort , '' he said . The memos ' release has added momentum to the debate over whether Bush administration officials ought to be prosecuted for authorizing such policies . Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would decide whether to investigate Bush administration officials who formed the legal basis for the techniques . The Obama administration has said that CIA interrogators who followed the instructions would not be prosecuted for their work . `` We are going to follow the evidence , follow the law and take that where it leads , '' Holder said . `` No one is above the law .

791,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk . John Demjanjuk , shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal , is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp . The decision by the Department of Justice 's Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church , Virginia , clears the way for Demjanjuk 's deportation to Germany , where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor , a Nazi death camp in Poland . The deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history , while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial . Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany , a board official said . The appeals board rejected Demjanjuk 's emergency stay request because it concluded '' there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted , '' according to board officials . The pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk , 89 , to Germany would constitute torture . `` In the four years since his deportation was -LSB- initially -RSB- ordered , his health has seriously deteriorated , '' Demjanjuk 's attorney , John Broadley , told CNN in a recent telephone interview . Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia , kidney problems , spinal problems and `` a couple of types of gout . '' The board , however , has already signaled that argument will be rejected . Demjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals , though his chances of getting the board 's ruling overturned are believed to be slim , according to Justice Department officials . Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley 's argument for his client . `` He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor , '' Hier said . Hier called Demjanjuk 's comparison of his planned deportation to torture `` preposterous coming from a person that served the -LSB- Nazi organization -RSB- S.S. in a death camp . It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust . '' Hier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp , and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless . `` You were there for one job : kill the Jews , '' he said . `` And that 's what they did full-time . '' He called the evidence against Demjanjuk `` overwhelming . '' German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943 . They studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations , and concluded it was genuine , before issuing the warrant . Demjanjuk , a retired autoworker living in Cleveland , Ohio , has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades . He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel , where he was convicted in 1986 of being `` Ivan the Terrible , '' a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp . The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal , and he returned to the United States . The United States filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard . He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court . Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian , says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans . CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .",for what reason was he refused,there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted
792,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a column appearing in Newsweek , world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria said he thinks it would be best for Republican presidential hopeful John McCain if Gov. Sarah Palin bowed out as his vice presidential running mate . `` For him to choose Sarah Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible , '' says Zakaria . Zakaria says McCain did not put the country first in making his V.P. choice , and he says Palin is not qualified to lead the United States . CNN spoke to him about his commentary titled , `` Palin is ready ? Please . '' CNN : What did you initially think when Sarah Palin was announced as the Republican vice presidential nominee ? Zakaria : I was a bit surprised -- as I think most people were . But I was willing to give her a chance . And I thought her speech at the convention was clever and funny . But once she began answering questions about economics and foreign policy , it became clear that she has simply never thought about these subjects before and is dangerously ignorant and unprepared for the job of vice president , let alone president . Watch Zakaria slam Sarah Palin '' CNN : You do n't think she is qualified ? Zakaria : No . Gov. Palin has been given a set of talking points by campaign advisers , simple ideological mantras that she repeats and repeats as long as she can . But if forced off those rehearsed lines , what she has to say is often , quite frankly -- nonsense . Just listen to her response to Katie Couric 's question about the bailout . It 's gibberish -- an emptying out of catchphrases about economics that have nothing to do with the question or the topic . It 's scary to think that this person could be running the country . Here is their exchange : Katie Couric : Why is n't it better , Gov. Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle-class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ; allow them to spend more and put more money into the economy instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ? Gov. Sarah Palin : That 's why I say I , like every American I 'm speaking with , we 're ill about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out . But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health-care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy , helping the -- it 's got to be all about job creation , too , shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track . So health-care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for Americans . And trade , we 've got to see trade as opportunity , not as a competitive , scary thing . But one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today , we 've got to look at that as more opportunity . All those things under the umbrella of job creation . This bailout is a part of that . CNN : But Dan Quayle was n't very qualified and that did n't seem to matter , did it ? Zakaria : This is way beyond Dan Quayle . Quayle was a lightweight who was prone to scramble his words , or say things that sounded weird , but you almost always knew what he meant . One of his most famous miscues was to the United Negro College Fund when he said , `` What a terrible thing to have lost one 's mind . Or not to have a mind at all . '' Now he was trying to play off a famous ad that the group used to run , `` A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste . '' And he screwed it up in a funny way . But read Gov. Palin 's answers and it does appear that she does n't have any understanding about the topic under discussion . CNN : But she has a lot of supporters . Zakaria : Look , I 'm not saying that she is not a feisty , charismatic politician who has done some good things in Alaska . It is just we are talking about a person who should be ready to lead the United States at a moment 's notice . She has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start . CNN : Does it make you concerned about Sen. McCain as a president ? Zakaria : Yes , and I say this with sadness because I greatly admire John McCain , a man of intelligence , honor and enormous personal and political courage . However , for him to choose Sara Palin to be his running mate is fundamentally irresponsible . He did not put the country first with this decision . Whether it is appropriate or not , considering Sen. McCain 's age most people expected to have a vice presidential candidate who would be ready to step in at a moment 's notice . The actuarial odds of that happening are significant , something like a one-in-five chance .",Does Zakaria think Palin should be thinking about national and global issues,"She has never spent a day thinking about any important national or international issue , and this is a hell of a time to start"
793,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israel was founded on democratic principles with the Jewish state 's declaration of independence in 1948 including a commitment to the `` complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion , race or sex . '' It has remained a continuous democracy ever since . The 120-seat Knesset is the Israeli seat of government . The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset , the country 's national parliament , located in Jerusalem , which Israel claims as its capital . The Knesset 's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote . Knesset seats are divided according to each party 's proportion of the overall vote . But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat . Participation in elections , including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population , has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout , according to Israeli government figures . Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters . Israel usually holds national elections every four years . But this year 's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni 's failure to form a coalition . Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim . Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel ; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself . Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition . Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections , including major parties such as Kadima , Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties . The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel 's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition . The prime minister-designate then has 28 days , extendable by 14 days , to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members . Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2 .",How many eligible voters are there in Israel ?,around 5.3 million
794,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A suspect charged in the failed Times Square car bombing is a Pakistani who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009 and used to work as a financial analyst in Connecticut . Faisal Shahzad , 30 , most recently of Bridgeport , Connecticut , was arrested Monday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York as his flight to Dubai was about to take off , law enforcement officials said . Federal authorities had put him on a no-fly list earlier in the day , with investigators having determined that he had purchased the vehicle used in Saturday 's failed bombing attempt , FBI Deputy Director John Pistole said Tuesday . Customs and Border Protection agents reacted quickly to the name match and made the arrest , Pistole said . Shahzad has been charged with five counts in connection with the case , according to documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York . According to the documents , he admitted to law enforcement officials that he attempted to detonate the bomb and that he recently received bomb-making training in the Waziristan region of Pakistan . Also according to the complaint , Shahzad returned to the United States via a one-way ticket from Pakistan on February 3 . He had told immigration officials upon his return that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for the previous five months , the complaint said . Shahzad has a Karachi identification card , a sign of Pakistani residency , and his family is from northwestern Pakistan , according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik . His father is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force , Shahzad 's cousin , Kafayat Ali , said on Tuesday . The father , Bahar Ul Haq , a former air vice marshal , lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad in Pakistan . Shahzad came to the United States and attended college , earning a bachelor 's degree in computer applications and information systems from Connecticut 's University of Bridgeport in 2000 . He earned an MBA at the school in 2005 . He started working as a junior financial analyst for Affinion Media Group in Norwalk , Connecticut , in 2006 , leaving voluntarily in June 2009 , according to Affinion spokesman Michael Bush . Before what the court document says was Shahzad 's trip to Pakistan , he lived in Shelton , Connecticut . A woman who said she had lived next door to him in Shelton told CNN on Tuesday that the man she knew did n't say much and claimed to work on Wall Street in New York . `` He was quiet . He would wear all black and jog at night . He said he did n't like the sunlight , '' Brenda Thurman said . She said Shahzad , his wife and two children and his wife 's two sisters lived next to her for about three years , moving out in July 2009 . People whom she believes were plainclothes law enforcement officers appeared to be staking out the house Monday , Thurman told CNN affiliate WTNH-TV . The neighbor said she often saw Shahzad leaving the home in the morning and returning in the evening . She also saw him in his yard with his children , a boy and a girl , and the family usually wore traditional Muslim attire , she told WTNH-TV . She said she never suspected he might be involved in a possible terror attack . `` I did n't think he was capable of doing something like that . ... I 'm very shocked , '' she said . Thurman said her daughter often played with Shahzad 's daughter , but she herself did n't have much contact with the family . Shahzad 's wife spoke English , but was apparently so insecure about her language ability that she told people she did not , Thurman said . `` I never knew she spoke English until it was time for her to move , '' Thurman said . Shahzad 's wife told Thurman in July 2009 that the family was moving to Missouri . A few weeks after they left their home , the lender foreclosed on the property and changed the locks , the neighbor said . At the Bridgeport residence where authorities say he lived most recently , agents with the FBI and local police , including members of a bomb squad , conducted a search , and investigators removed filled plastic bags . Cell phone calls conducted for the purchase of the vehicle used in Saturday 's bombing attempt helped lead police to the suspect , law enforcement sources said . Sources said investigators got cell phone information from the daughter of the Nissan Pathfinder owner . She sold the vehicle to Shahzad on behalf of her father . She had been talking on the phone to Shahzad in arranging the purchase of the SUV , which was advertised for sale on Craigslist . The Nissan Pathfinder was parked in Times Square containing propane tanks , fertilizer and gasoline on Saturday night . After police retrieved the vehicle identification number of the Pathfinder , they located the registered owner of the vehicle . The sources said the owner 's daughter had met with Shahzad at a Stratford , Connecticut , grocery store , for the sale . Shahzad took the car for a test drive in the parking lot and bought the vehicle for $ 1,300 in cash . Bridgeport is a working class city of 130,000 on Long Island Sound , 66 miles northeast of New York City . Per capita income there is 26 percent below the national average , and 27 percent of its residents are foreign-born , more than twice the national average , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .

799,"Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko refuses to concede defeat in Ukraine 's presidential election and plans to demand a recount in some districts , officials from her party , Bloc Tymoshenko , said Tuesday . Meanwhile , her rival , former Ukrainian prime minister Victor Yanukovich told CNN it is time for her to give up . Yanukovich is leading Sunday 's runoff election . With 99.98 percent of the votes counted , he has 48.96 percent , while Tymoshenko has 45.47 percent , according to the country 's Central Election Commission . Yanukovich 's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until the vote count was final and their candidate named the winner , Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported . In an exclusive interview with CNN Tuesday , Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power . `` This country has been democratic for five years , and that 's been proven again by this election , '' he said . `` Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution '' by failing to acknowledge defeat . A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising . Ukrainian voter Nikolay Gluhovskiy said he supported Yanukovich because Tymoshenko had been a disappointment . `` All the time Yulia Tymoshenko has been in power , we had no prospects , '' he said at a Yanukovich rally Monday . `` Of course , she is a fighter , but in a bad sense . She should n't have promised us so much and done nothing . '' Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday , the Kremlin told CNN . `` Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign , which was highly rated by international observers , and the success achieved at the presidential election , '' the Kremlin 's statement press statement said . The Kremlin statement did not offer congratulations for a Yanukovich win , however . During the 2004 presidential election , then-Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first world leader to congratulate Yanukovich on his victory , a full two days before the electoral commission declared him the winner . Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night , Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down . But Tymoshenko has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts where , she says , voting irregularities took place , officials from her party said Tuesday . The two politicians have fought a bitter battle . Yanukovich has strong links to Russia , and a checkered election history . In 2004 , he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot 's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race . `` The country remembers times when there were presidents announced , they received congratulations , and then things changed , '' Tymoshenko said Sunday , referring to the 2004 race . A pro-Western uprising , known as the Orange Revolution , followed . Yanukovich 's win was annulled , and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote . Yushchenko ran for a second term this year , but , blamed for Ukraine 's faltering economy , he did not make the runoff . This year 's elections , by contrast to those in 2004 , got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which sent observers . The OSCE hailed the process as `` professional , transparent and honest , '' saying it should `` serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power .

801,"LAGOS , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 200 people have died of meningitis in the past week alone in Niger and Nigeria , according to the World Health Organization . A health care worker vaccinates a child during an earlier outbreak of meningitis in Niger . The disease is an epidemic in 76 areas of the two countries , the health agency reported Wednesday . A spokesman for W.H.O. in Nigeria , Dr. Olaokun Soyinka , said Saturday that the outbreak is bigger than usual and stretches across the African meningitis belt from east - to west-sub-Saharan Africa . The outbreak began around the start of the year , Soyinka told CNN . It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust , winds and cold nights , before dipping around May when the rains come , he said . A shortage of vaccines means officials are relying on `` effective prevention , '' in which they watch for outbreaks and then vaccinate people in the epicenter and surrounding areas , Soyinka told CNN . There have been nearly 25,000 suspected cases and more than 1,500 deaths in the meningitis belt in the first 11 weeks of the year , W.H.O. reported . More than 85 percent of those cases happened in northern Nigeria and Niger . Nigeria 's Ministry of Health has reported 17,462 suspected cases of meningococcal disease , including 960 deaths , the world health agency said . In the past week , it reported 4,164 suspected cases with 171 deaths . Sixty-six local government areas in Nigeria have crossed the epidemic threshold . Epidemic thresholds are a way the W.H.O. confirms the emergence of an epidemic so it can step up vaccinations and other management measures . Niger 's Ministry of Health has reported 4,513 suspected cases of meningococcal disease , including 169 deaths , since the start of the year . In the past week , 1,071 suspected cases and 30 deaths have been reported , the W.H.O. said . Ten of Niger 's 42 districts have crossed the epidemic threshold . By comparison , other countries are reporting fewer than 50 cases a week . Meningitis is an infection of the meninges , the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord . Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for this outbreak -- is one of the most significant because of its potential to cause epidemics . Health authorities have released 2.3 million doses of vaccine to Nigeria and 1.9 million doses to Niger , the W.H.O. said .

802,"BOSTON , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Before Amy Harned goes outside to work in her garden , she coats her face and neck with sunscreen , then puts on a hat , jacket and work gloves . Amy Harned , 48 , takes a lot of vitamins and maintains a healthy diet to manage her lupus . The 48-year-old is doing more than protecting herself from dangerous ultraviolet rays . She 's trying to keep the sunlight from triggering a flareup of her lupus . Harned , who lives in Webster , Massachusetts , is among the 1.5 million Americans who suffer from the autoimmune disorder . Lupus causes the body 's immune system to attack its own tissues , causing inflammation and damage . When Harned 's lupus was first diagnosed , she said she `` was really terrified , but gradually I got more information . '' She realized with proper treatment she could lead a somewhat normal life . No two cases are alike , experts say . In fact , there are four types of the illness , ranging from mild to severe . Before effective therapies were developed , the disease was fatal more often , usually from overwhelming infection and kidney failure . Health Minute : Watch more on living with lupus '' The Lupus Foundation of America estimated that more than 16,000 new cases develop every year . More than 90 percent of people with lupus are women , the group says . Experts are n't sure why . `` It clearly has to do with estrogen and estrogen receptors , '' said Lisa Fitzgerald , a Boston , Massachusetts-based rheumatologist . Genetics can play a role as well . Not only does lupus run in families , but , Fitzgerald said , a person may be more susceptible if a relative has other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis . Environmental factors also may increase risk of the disease . Researchers believe that taking certain prescription medications , and even exposure to sunlight , can trigger the illness . Age is another risk factor . The Lupus Foundation says the condition is most often diagnosed when women are in their childbearing years between 15 and 45 . Harned 's symptoms developed 15 years ago , when she was 33 . `` My first symptoms with lupus were -LSB- that -RSB- my hands were swollen , '' Harned recalled . `` They were very stiff , to the point that brushing my teeth was hard just holding the toothbrush . '' The stiffness and achy joint pain are caused by inflammation brought on by lupus , Fitzgerald said . In addition to swollen joints , she said the other symptoms include fatigue , facial rash , fever , chest pain , swollen glands and sores in the mouth and nose . With such varied symptoms , diagnosis can be tricky . The American College of Rheumatology recommends doctors confirm four of 11 criteria for a proper diagnosis . A blood test and urinalysis are two of the ways doctors determine whether a patient has lupus . Researchers have come a long way in the last 50 years when it comes to understanding the condition , Fitzgerald said . `` The prognosis for lupus today is very good , '' she said . `` The survival rate is really over 90 percent in five to 10 years of having the disease . In the 1950s it was probably 50 percent . '' Part of the reason for the improved success has to do with better treatment in managing the condition . Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin , naproxen and ibuprofen offer relief to some patients . Other lupus sufferers might be prescribed an antimalarial drug called hydroxychloroquine . `` It 's a quinine derivative . It 's quite safe , '' Fitzgerald said . `` It can make a big difference for patients who have mild disease . '' Fitzgerald added she also prescribes corticosteroids `` to squelch flareups . '' While they work well , she cautioned they do have side effects . After 15 years of living with the condition , Harned has her own tricks for coping with lupus . In addition to taking daily prescription drugs , Harned controls the symptoms by eating a healthy diet and exercising , getting enough rest and taking what she called `` a ton of vitamins . '' Some experts have touted fish oil and flaxseed as promising complements that may help ease inflammation . Harned also slathers her exposed skin with sunscreen containing SPF 45 . `` There is an aspect of ultraviolet light that can damage DNA in the cells , '' Fitzgerald said . `` This sets off an inflammatory reaction that causes the rash we know as lupus rash . '' While Harned is fully aware there is no cure for lupus , she described herself as someone who is not just managing her illness , but thriving . When she looks toward the future , she said she thinks , `` I had grandparents who lived into their 90s . So that 's what I 'm hoping for , maybe even 100 .

803,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home , a medical examiner said Tuesday . Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his family in June . Dr. Kris Sperry , Georgia 's chief medical examiner , said the body of Benoit 's wife , Nancy , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs . Sperry said it 's likely the Benoits ' 7-year-old son , Daniel , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy 's system . Xanax is not normally prescribed for children , Sperry said . Chris Benoit 's body contained an `` elevated '' level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , Sperry said . But , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death . `` There 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , '' Sperry said . `` The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , '' he said . `` It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency . '' The investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in Benoit 's body . The investigation into the Benoits ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called '' ` roid rage , '' leading him to kill his wife and son . An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy . The Orlando , Florida , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids . Phil Astin , Benoit 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs . Astin has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest . Although Benoit 's name was not mentioned in Astin 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths . `` Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville , Georgia , Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4 , 2006 , through May 9 , 2007 , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone . Nancy Benoit 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body `` could come from the decomposition process . '' Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel 's body . Daniel 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but Sperry could not speculate why . District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths , which he said is ongoing . `` We 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , '' he said . `` We 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household . This -LRB- the toxicology report -RRB- adds one element to all the other elements .

806,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The biggest surprise on a busy night of international football on Wednesday came in Duesseldorf , where Euro 2008 finalists Germany were beaten by Norway for the first time in 73 years . Norway players celebrate Christian Grindheim 's -LRB- No. 16 -RRB- goal in their shock victory over Germany . Midfielder Christian Grindheim scored from close-range , from Morten Gamst Pedersen 's cross , in the 63rd minute to give the visitors a 1-0 victory to stun the 45,000 home supporters on a freezing evening . Not since the 1936 Olympics in Berlin had Germany lost to Norway -- the defeat even more suprising as Germany coach Joachim Loew had the luxury of naming a full-strength side , while new Norway coach Egil Olsen was missing seven key players . In Marseille , Lionel Messi scored a brilliant solo goal to give Argentina a 2-0 win over France and give Diego Maradona a second straight win as national coach . The Barcelona striker collected the ball outside the penalty area and ran right through the home defense before expertly slotting the ball past goalkeeper Steve Mandanda . Newcastle winger Jonas Gutierrez had opened the scoring four minutes before the interval with a shot that went inside Mandanda 's left-hand post . Meanwhile , Jamel Saihi scored a second-half equalizer to give home side Tunisia a 1-1 draw with the Netherlands in Rades . Montpellier star Saihi netted midway through the second-half with a long-range shot that Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg should have saved . Klaas Jan Huntelaar has given the visitors the lead in the 62nd minute when converting his 11th goal in 19 internationals , after Joris Mathijsen had headed down a long ball from Stijn Schaars . Elsewhere , Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva returned to action for the first time since breaking his leg 12 months ago -- helping Croatia to a 2-1 victory over Romania in Bucharest . Eduardo , who fractured his left fibula and dislocated his ankle against Birmingham in February 2008 , replaced Ivica Olic in the 61st minute and set up Niko Kranjcar for a 75th-minute winner .

808,"SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Puerto Rico on Sunday and insisted that she is leading Sen. Barack Obama in the popular vote . Clinton won 68 percent of the vote compared with Obama 's 32 percent . Her vote tally was 263,120 ; his was 121,458 . The win gives Clinton the larger share of Puerto Rico 's 55 delegates . The Democratic primary season ends Tuesday when Montana and South Dakota cast their votes . `` When the voting concludes on Tuesday , neither Sen. Obama nor I will have the number of delegates to be the nominee , '' she said in San Juan , Puerto Rico . `` I will lead the popular vote ; he will maintain a slight lead in the delegate count , '' she said . Obama leads in the overall delegate count -- 2,070 to Clinton 's 1,915 . CNN analysts weigh in on Clinton 's next steps '' A candidate needs 2,118 to claim the Democratic nomination . The Clinton campaign has been focusing on the popular vote as it tries to convince superdelegates to pick her instead of Obama . The superdelegates are a group of about 800 party leaders and officials who vote at the convention for the candidate of their choice . But the popular vote count is debatable . If all the primary results including Florida and Michigan are counted , but not the caucus votes , Clinton leads in the popular vote 17,461,845 to Obama 's 17,244,762 , according to CNN estimates . That number includes giving Obama all the `` uncommitted '' votes from Michigan . Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early . Clinton won both states , but Obama 's name was not even on the ballot in Michigan . The Democratic National Committee decided Saturday to reinstate all of Florida and Michigan 's delegates to the national convention , with each delegate getting a half-vote to penalize the two states for holding their primaries earlier than party rules allowed . The DNC 's Rules and Bylaws Committee 's move gave Clinton 87 delegates and Obama 63 . In a second scenario , which adds in CNN 's estimate of the caucus-goers , Obama leads Clinton 17,928,000 to 17,843,000 . And in a third scenario , which includes all of the caucuses but does not give Obama Michigan 's `` uncommitted '' vote , Clinton leads 17,873,000 to 17,703,000 . Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence that Obama would clinch the nomination in the coming days . `` If not Tuesday , I think it will be fairly soon , '' he said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` We hope this week , absolutely , '' he added . At a campaign stop in Mitchell , South Dakota , Obama congratulated Clinton for her win Sunday and praised her for being an `` outstanding public servant . '' `` She is going to be a great asset when we go into November to make sure that we defeat the Republicans , '' he said . Watch Obama rally in South Dakota '' As Clinton tries to win over the undecided superdelegates , she argued Sunday that she would be the stronger candidate to face Republican John McCain in the fall . `` In the final assessment , I ask you to consider these questions : Which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary ? Which candidate is best able to lead us to victory in November ? And which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad ? '' In the Puerto Rico primary , Clinton swept Obama in every major demographic group , including groups Obama generally wins , such as younger voters and higher-income voters , according to CNN 's exit polls . CNN estimated turnout to be between 325,000 and 425,000 . `` Most people in Puerto Rico , I would venture to guess , they are not even aware that there 's a primary going on , '' said Luis Pabón-Roca , a local political analyst . Part of the reason for the lack of interest , he said , is because voters feel the primary is n't meaningful since Puerto Ricans can not vote in the general election . The Democratic and Republican parties run the primaries and caucuses , and they allow U.S. territories , such as the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , to take part in the process . But only the 50 states and the District of Columbia vote in the general election .

809,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , has died at age 93 , according to his family . Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam . McNamara was a member of Kennedy 's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war . But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam , overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops . Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed `` McNamara 's War , '' he later said both administrations were `` terribly wrong '' to have pursued military action beyond 1963 . `` External military force can not reconstruct a failed state , and Vietnam , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , '' he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the `` Cold War '' documentary series . `` We did n't recognize it as such . '' A native of San Francisco , McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master 's degree in business from Harvard . He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II , when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency . After the war , he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family . A month later , the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the `` whiz kids '' who joined the young president 's administration . In October 1962 , after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba , McNamara was one of Kennedy 's top advisers in the standoff that followed . The United States imposed a naval `` quarantine '' on Cuba , a Soviet ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion . The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba , a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people . In the 2003 documentary `` The Fog of War , '' McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to `` put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes . '' But he added , `` In the end , we lucked out . It was luck that prevented nuclear war . '' McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon , computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military 's vast purchasing and personnel system . And in Vietnam , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war . Metrics such as use of `` body counts '' and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict . McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand . He , Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia . But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union , which backed communist North Vietnam , McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S.-backed government in Saigon . `` The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , '' he told CNN . Casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war . In 1965 , a Quaker anti-war protester , Norman Morrison , set himself on fire outside McNamara 's office window . In 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon , which was ringed with troops . By November 1967 , McNamara told Johnson that there was `` no reasonable way '' to end the war quickly , and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American-backed government in Saigon . By the end of that month , Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank . But by March 1968 , Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara . He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election . After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968 , McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank . He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir , `` In Retrospect . '' `` You do n't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear , '' he told Morris . `` A lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me . A lot of people think I 'm a son of a bitch . ''",what McNamara became lightning rod for his management of ?,of the war in Vietnam

Tottenham have been in superb form in recent weeks , winning nine of their last 10 league games to move up to third place in the table . However , their European form has not been as strong , and this month 's 1-0 reverse at Rubin Kazan was followed by another defeat on Wednesday to leave Harry Redknapp 's side needing PAOK to win their last game next month in order to help Tottenham achieve qualification through to the last 32 . The visitors went ahead in the sixth minute when an unmarked Dimitris Salpingidis guided the ball home from Giorgos Georgiadis ' right-wing cross . And PAOK doubled their lead seven minutes later when Stefanos Athanasiadis tapped home from close range after more suspect Spurs marking . The home side pulled one back seven minutes before the break when Luka Modric scored from the penalty spot after Konstantinos Stafylidis was dismissed for handball on the line . However , despite having a numerical advantage for the whole of the second half , Tottenham failed to find the goal they needed . The result means PAOK are top on 11 points and have qualified for the last 32 knockout stage . Russian side Rubin Kazan are second on 10 points after thrashing Shamrock Rovers 4-1 in the other group game . For Spurs to qualify , they will now need to win heavily at Shamrock in their final match , and hope Rubin Kazan are beaten at PAOK in the other tie . Also through to the last 32 are 2010 winners Atletico Madrid , after the Spanish side won 1-0 at Celtic in Group I thanks to a superb long-range strike from Turkish international Arda Turan on the half-hour mark . The other match between Rennes of France and Italians Udinese ended 0-0 , a result that means Atletico have qualified with 10 points ahead of the final round of matches . Udinese are second on eight points and they will secure their place in the knockout round if they draw at home to Celtic in their final game , with the Scottish side needing a victory to progress . Group C is the only group where both qualifiers have now been decided , after PSV Eindhoven won 3-0 at Legia Warsaw . That result means both sides have gone through , on 13 points and nine points respectively . Romanians Rapid Bucharest needed to beat Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv at home to retain any hope , but they were beaten 3-1 . Another side to reach the knockout stage is Standard Liege , who saw off Germans Hannover 2-0 to make it three wins and two draws from their five Group B matches so far . The Belgian outfit are on 11 points , three ahead of Hannover , who need a point from their final match against Vorskla Poltava to also secure qualification . Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkov continued their impressive run of form in the competition , thumping Austria Vienna 4-1 to secure their qualification from Group G with 13 points from their five matches . Malmo and AZ Alkmaar drew 0-0 in the other match to leave Alkmaar needing to beat Kharkov in their final match to join their opponents in the last 32 . However , there is all to play for in Group H , with any two of three teams still able to qualify . Last year 's beaten finalists Sporting Braga beat Birmingham City 1-0 , while a remarkable match in Slovenia saw Bruges of Belgium fight back from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in injury time against Maribor . That means Bruges and Braga are level on 10 points and they play each other in the final match . A draw there will see them both qualify with Birmingham , who are three points behind in third place , needing to beat Maribor in their final match and hoping the other game does not end in a draw . There was a suprise result in the English League Cup quarterfinals , where Manchester United were beaten 2-1 at home by Championship side Crystal Palace in extra time . That result means Palace now play fellow-second tier side Cardiff City in the semifinals , while Premier League giants Liverpool and Manchester City face each other in the second semifinal .",What they need to do ?,PAOK to win their last game

815,"London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fans and friends of Paul McCartney gathered in central London Sunday to watch the ex-Beatle walk down the aisle for the third time , as he married girlfriend Nancy Shevell . The couple arrived together just before 3:30 p.m. , the groom in a blue suit and the bride in a long-sleeved white gown with a white flower in her hair . Both wore outfits by McCartney 's fashion designer daughter Stella , said Monique Jessen of People magazine . The crowd of hundreds went wild when they appeared , with one well-wisher saying of the match : `` It just seems right . '' McCartney , 69 , and his 51-year-old bride left Marylebone Town Hall about an hour later and waved to crowds while being showered with confetti , before arriving at McCartney 's home . Ringo Starr , the only other surviving former Beatle , was there , as was iconic U.S. television host Barbara Walters , who reportedly played a role in introducing McCartney and Shevell , an American trucking heiress . Walters is Shevell 's second cousin , she said on her show `` The View '' in 2007 . McCartney and Shevell got engaged in May , a McCartney representative told CNN at the time . The wedding took place at the same venue where McCartney married his first wife , Linda , in 1969 . She died of breast cancer , aged 56 , in 1998 . A memorial service for her two months later was the first time McCartney , Starr and George Harrison appeared together in public since the Beatles split in 1970 . John Lennon , the fourth member of the band , was shot dead in New York in 1980 . Shevell , the bride , is the daughter of a New Jersey trucking magnate . She is an executive at her father 's company , New England Motor Freight , and a 10-year member of New York 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority . She was married once before , to lawyer Bruce Blakeman , who is active in Republican and Jewish circles in New York state . He ran unsuccessfully for Senate against Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand last year . Her father 's company has annual revenues of about $ 400 million , says Blakeman 's biography on his law firm 's website . Press reports say they have a 19-year-old son . Alison Cathcart , who performed McCartney 's third wedding , called the venue `` a rock 'n' roll place to tie the knot . '' Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit married there , as did Melanie Griffiths and Antonio Banderas . Cathcart has conducted marriage services for celebrities including Sylvester Stallone and Joan Collins , Westminster City Council says .

816,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama released his long-awaited debt reduction plan Monday , outlining a roughly $ 3 trillion savings blueprint that was immediately criticized by top congressional and other Republicans . The president 's plan includes $ 1.5 trillion in new revenue generated largely by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans , a proposal strongly opposed by GOP leaders who insist that any tax increase will undermine an already shaky economy . The measure -- which would add to nearly $ 1 trillion in savings signed into law under the debt-ceiling deal enacted in August -- does not include changes to Social Security . It would increase Medicare premiums for individuals with higher incomes starting in 2017 -- the year Obama leaves office if he wins a second term . `` We are not going to have a one-sided deal that hurts the folks that are most vulnerable , '' Obama said at the White House , offering a defense of tax hikes on the highest earners . Spending cuts alone `` will not solve our fiscal problems . We ca n't just cut our way out of this hole , '' he added . `` It 's going to take a balanced approach . If we 're going to make spending cuts -- many of which we would n't make if we were n't facing such large budget deficits -- then it 's only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share . '' Obama explicitly promised to veto any debt-reduction legislation that cuts benefits while failing to include higher taxes on the wealthy . iReport : What do you think about Obama 's plan ? `` I will not support any plan that puts all the burden on ordinary Americans , '' he insisted . Republicans responded by dismissing the plan as little more than a cheap political gimmick . It 's `` a thinly veiled attempt to score political points , '' said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus . `` By raising taxes on job creators , Obama may win back some support from disgruntled liberal voters , but America will lose even more sorely needed jobs . '' `` Veto threats , a massive tax hike , phantom savings and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth â $ '' or even meaningful deficit reduction , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky . `` Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership , '' added House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . Key congressional Democrats quickly rallied to Obama 's defense , calling the blueprint a serious attempt to take on one of the most contentious issues in Washington . The `` proposal is clearly moving in the right direction , '' said North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . `` It represents a significant and balanced plan for bringing our deficits and debt under control . '' On Monday night , Obama referred to the Republican response as predictable and said the issue shows the fundamental difference between the parties on how the nation should deal with mounting federal deficits and national debt . `` What has been clear over the last two and a half years is that we have not had a willing partner , '' Obama told a New York fundraising event . `` Now , we 've been able to get some stuff done despite that , and despite a filibuster in the Senate . But at least over the last nine months what we 've seen is some irreconcilable differences , let 's put it that way . '' The release of Obama 's blueprint is likely to set the stage for a fall dominated by harsh partisan debates over taxes and spending , as well as a 2012 presidential campaign focused on growing economic fears . Under Obama 's plan , $ 800 billion in revenue would be generated by allowing some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income households to expire , as the president has repeatedly called for . An additional $ 400 billion would result from capping the value of itemized deductions and other exemptions for high-income households . Read the White House plan -LRB- PDF -RRB- The remaining $ 300 billion would come from closing various tax loopholes , according to a senior administration official . A new tax surcharge could also be imposed on millionaires : the `` Buffett Rule , '' named after investor Warren Buffett , who argues that the richest Americans are not taxed enough . Wealthier Americans often derive much of their income from investments , which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income such as wages . As a result , they can end up owing a lower percentage of their income in federal taxes than someone who makes less money , especially once payroll taxes are factored in . The concept behind the Buffett Rule is that those earning more than $ 1 million should not be allowed to pay a lesser percentage of their income in federal taxes than Americans lower down the income scale . Read more : On taxes and debt , left and right dare to agree In terms of spending , Obama 's plan incorporates $ 580 billion in mandatory cuts , including $ 248 billion from the politically popular Medicare program . Roughly 90 % of those savings will come from reducing overpayments in the system , according to a senior administration official . Any changes to Medicare benefits wo n't kick in before 2017 , the official said . An additional $ 72 billion will come from Medicaid and other health programs . The president 's plan does not include any Social Security reform proposals or changes to the Medicare eligibility age , reforms that have reportedly been put on the table by the administration in the past but are strongly opposed by a number of progressive Democrats . Another $ 1.1 trillion in savings would be generated by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . In addition , the administration is counting savings that would result from spending caps it has proposed on future overseas contingency operations . The administration also estimates interest savings of approximately $ 430 billion , a result of less borrowing and smaller annual budget shortfalls . Roughly $ 450 billion in the plan would be used to pay for the American Jobs Act , the economic stimulus measure proposed by Obama last week . Top Republicans call the president 's plan a form of class warfare . `` When you pick one area of the economy and you say , ` We 're going to tax those people because most people are not those people , ' that 's class warfare , '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` We have a difference of opinion on how best to fix these problems , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin , told `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` But when the president does things like this , it leads you to believe that he 's not in bipartisan consensus-making mood . He 's in a political class-warfare mode and campaign mode . And that 's not good for our economy . '' Obama explicitly rejected the class warfare claim Monday . `` I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare , '' the president said . `` I think it 's just the right the thing to do . I believe the American middle class , who 've been pressured relentlessly for decades , believe it 's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations . '' Democrats have blamed Republicans for blocking the Obama administration 's initiatives purely for what Democrats insist are short-term political gain . `` I do n't think people like that style of politics , and that 's the reality ... we 'll be facing in November 2012 , '' Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Illinois , said Sunday . Congressional action on deficit reduction is moving on multiple tracks now . Durbin said the Democratic-controlled Senate would take up Obama 's jobs plan next month , while leaders in the Republican-controlled House have rejected some parts of it . Meanwhile , a special deficit reduction commission created under last month 's debt-ceiling agreement has started its work amid the longstanding political divisions on key issues . The 12-member committee , evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate , has until November 23 to draft a $ 1.5 trillion deficit-reduction plan that can win congressional approval by December 23 . Otherwise , more than $ 1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect , on top of $ 900 billion in cuts already mandated under the debt ceiling deal . The special committee `` is taking this issue far more seriously than the White House , '' McConnell said Monday . More than a year of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction has failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise tax revenue while cutting spending . The brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason that ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA-plus in August .

817,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution Friday that says it supports `` all Iranians who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law . '' Throngs in Tehran cheer Thursday for defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi , center . The resolution was approved by 405 lawmakers , while one -- Rep. Ron Paul , R-Texas -- voted against it . Two others , Reps. Brad Ellsworth , D-Indiana , and Dave Loebsack , D-Iowa , voted `` present . '' In a statement on his Web site , Paul said he voted against the measure because he is `` always very cautious about ` condemning ' the actions of governments overseas . '' `` I have always hesitated when my colleagues rush to pronounce final judgment on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little , '' said Paul , who attracted attention last year during his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination . `` And we know very little beyond limited press reports about what is happening in Iran . '' The resolution , which also `` condemns the ongoing violence against demonstrators , '' was sponsored by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman , D-California , and two Republicans , Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia . Speaking shortly after the resolution passed , Pence called it a message from Americans to the Iranian people . `` As Americans have done throughout our history , this Congress today , on behalf of the American people , has spoken a word of heartfelt support to all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom , human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law , '' he said . He urged U.S. senators to support the identical resolution that Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , introduced Friday . Both Pence and McCain have been outspoken in their criticism of President Obama 's response to massive rallies in Iran against the results of last week 's presidential election . Watch as Obama walks a fine line '' Supporters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi have taken to the streets this week calling for a new election after the results of the June 12 vote showed an overwhelming victory for hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . The rallies also have denounced the Iranian government 's crackdown on the protests in which at least eight people have died . Obama has said he is `` deeply troubled '' by the violence , but he has avoided siding with Ahmadinejad 's opponents , telling reporters , `` It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be . '' `` It 's not productive , given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations , to be seen as meddling , the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections , '' Obama said this week . But several Republicans , particularly McCain -- Obama 's opponent in last year 's presidential race -- have criticized the administration 's position . McCain introduced a resolution on the Senate floor Friday morning that he said would be `` an expression of support by the government and the people of the United States of America '' for those protesting the election results . `` It is unfortunate in a way that this resolution is required since the administration does not want to ` meddle ' and has refused , the president has refused to speak out in support of these brave Iranian citizens , most of them young , who are risking their very lives to protest what was clearly an unfair and corrupt election , '' McCain told his fellow senators . Watch what else McCain said about Obama '' The resolution passed Friday states that the House : On Thursday , Cantor joined the critics of the White House , saying the United States has a `` moral responsibility '' to condemn attacks on protesters . `` The administration 's position that what 's going on in Iran is a ` vigorous debate ' is absurd , '' he said . `` People are being brutalized and murdered by the regime in Tehran . We have no idea exactly how many have died or have been seriously injured since the regime has restricted journalists . In no way do these actions constitute a ` vigorous debate . ' '' Cantor , the No. 2 Republican in the House , added , `` America has a moral responsibility to stand up for these brave people , to defend human rights and to condemn the violence and abuses by the regime in Tehran . '' Watch amateur video of protesters under attack '' Pence has called on the United States `` to take a half-step back from this administration 's olive branch and the apology approach to enemies and countries that have been hostile to the United States of America and our allies , particularly with the road to Iran . '' But Sen. John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Washington would be making an `` enormous mistake '' by taking sides in the Iranian protests . `` There is no need for the United States of America to step into the middle of it and make this about America , '' Kerry told CNN 's `` The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer . '' `` It is an Iranian moment , spurred on by Iranians , thoroughly supported by Iranians to the degree that the supreme ayatollah has now backed off his own support for the elections -LSB- and -RSB- called for an investigation , '' he said . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the administration 's approach this week , saying that Obama `` believes that he 's struck the right tone . '' `` I know some people agree with what Sen. McCain said . Some people agree with what other Republicans have said that 's very much like the president 's position , '' Gibbs said Thursday . `` The president strongly believes that we should -- and have -- spoken out to ensure the demonstrators have the universal right and principle to demonstrate without fear of harm . But at the same time , we have to respect their sovereignty . '' Moorhead Kennedy , a former diplomat who was among those taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 , said he supports the Obama administration 's position . `` I think if I had any conclusion to draw , we would have been much better off not interfering in Iran now , '' Kennedy told CNN 's `` American Morning . '' Because the United States backed a 1953 coup that put Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in charge , and supported him until the 1979 revolution that created today 's Islamic republic , Kennedy said , `` There are a great many resentments there .

Edward Kennedy 's brain was successful , and the Democrat should suffer no permanent damage from the procedure , his surgeon reported Monday . Sen. Edward Kennedy , right , leaves a Boston hospital with his son Patrick on May 21 . The patient himself expressed satisfaction . `` I feel like a million bucks , '' Kennedy said after the surgery , according to a family spokesperson . `` I think I 'll do that again tomorrow . '' Kennedy 's doctor 's statement focused on the 3 1/2 - hour operation , which was performed at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , North Carolina . `` I am pleased to report that Sen. Kennedy 's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals , '' Dr. Allan Friedman said in a written statement issued after the procedure . `` Sen. Kennedy was awake during the resection , and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery . '' Friedman called the resection `` just the first step '' in Kennedy 's treatment plan , which is to include radiation and chemotherapy , to be carried out at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . Paging Dr. Gupta Blog : Mapping Ted Kennedy 's brain The 76-year-old Massachusetts senator , patriarch of one of the leading families of American politics , said in a written statement earlier that he expected to remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery . He is also expected to undergo radiation and chemotherapy . During such surgery , doctors locate the areas of the brain responsible for key attributes such as movement and speech , and map them to ensure they avoid cutting in those areas . They then attempt to resect as much of the tumor as they believe they can safely remove . Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta explain possible treatment '' During such operations -- which Friedman and the Duke hospital are known for -- surgeons typically ask a patient to identify objects in pictures or make a certain movement , such as squeezing a hand to make sure areas of the brain involving speech and movement are not being impaired . Kennedy , a senator since 1962 , suffered a seizure May 17 while walking his dogs at his home in Hyannisport , Massachusetts . Three days later , Kennedy 's doctors at Massachusetts General said preliminary results from a brain biopsy showed a tumor in the left parietal lobe was responsible for the seizure . Friedman is chief of the division of neurosurgery and co-director of Duke 's Neuro-Oncology Program , according to the hospital 's Web site . He is responsible for more than 90 percent of all tumor removals and biopsies conducted at Duke , the Web site says .

Hear iReporter describes what gave him strength through brain cancer battle Gupta said such tumors do n't usually metastasize or spread to other parts of the body . `` What they do do -- and I think that 's a concern to people -- is that they grow , and sometimes they invade other normal parts of the brain . That is the big concern here , '' he said . Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor , accounting for more than half of the 18,000 primary malignant brain tumors diagnosed each year in the United States , according to the National Cancer Institute . An expert explains potential complications '' Kennedy is the brother of President John F. Kennedy , who was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 , and New York Sen. Robert Kennedy , who was assassinated while seeking the White House in 1968 . Though his own attempt to seek the presidency failed , Edward Kennedy has built a reputation as one of the most effective lawmakers in the Senate . Kennedy 's Monday statement focused on the current presidential race as well his surgery . `` After completing treatment , I look forward to returning to the United States Senate and to doing everything I can to help elect Barack Obama as our next president , '' he said . Obama , the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , described Kennedy as a `` giant '' of the Senate when the tumor was diagnosed . `` I think you can argue that I would not be sitting here as a presidential candidate had it not been for some of the battles that Ted Kennedy has fought , '' Obama said . `` He is somebody who battled for voting rights and civil rights when I was a child .

There is n't anybody like him who gets up and goes out and does battle on behalf of all of us every single day , '' Clinton said . `` I know he 's a fighter when it comes to the challenges he 's facing right now .

822,"Children and teens who have a parent with bipolar disorder are 14 times more likely than their peers to have bipolar-like symptoms themselves , and are two to three times more likely to be found to have an anxiety or mood disorder , such as depression , according to a report in the March issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry . More than 10 percent of the kids with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar-spectrum , mood or anxiety disorder . When both parents are bipolar , children are 3.6 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than children with only one parent with the psychiatric condition . Bipolar disorder , which is also known as manic-depressive illness , affects 5.7 million people over age 18 in the United States . The condition is characterized by extreme fluctuations in energy , mood , and the ability to function . For example , someone experiencing an `` episode '' may have a manic state of euphoria for a period of time , followed by a bout of severe depression . Although bipolar disorder may run in families , it 's not guaranteed that children of bipolar parents will develop the condition too . `` I do n't want parents to think ' I have bipolar , so my kids have bipolar , ' '' says Boris Birmaher , M.D. , of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and author of the new study , called the Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study . `` Yes , these kids are at a higher risk , but that does n't necessarily mean your child will have it .

They were compared with a control group of 143 parents and 251 children with no family history of the condition . Overall , 10.6 percent of the children with a bipolar parent had signs of a bipolar spectrum disorder -LRB- which includes a range of symptoms from severe to less so -RRB- or a mood or anxiety disorder . In comparison , only two children , or 0.8 percent , in the control group had such symptoms . It 's not clear whether genes , environment or a combination of both are responsible for the link , or possibly greater awareness and diagnosis of psychiatric conditions in bipolar families . Health.com : How a bipolar patient learned to manage mania However , Birmaher says identifying the condition at an earlier age may ultimately help young people . `` The longer you wait , the more complicated the condition could become , '' Birmaher says . Previous studies have suggested that it can take 10 years of symptoms before people get a correct diagnosis and proper treatment . `` Ten years is a long time -- especially in the life of a child , '' he says . The condition is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can be mistaken for depression , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or one of the disruptive behavior disorders . Signs of a manic episode include increased energy , extreme irritability , racing thoughts , spending sprees , abuse of drugs -LRB- particularly cocaine -RRB- , and increased sexual drive . A depressive episode may range from disruptive sleeping patterns to thoughts of death or suicide . `` The chronic highs and lows are only two manifestations of the condition , '' says Gary Sachs , M.D. , director of the bipolar clinic and research program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . `` But there are plenty of people who live a full , functional life and still have bipolar disorder .

825,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson , the show-stopping singer whose best-selling albums -- including `` Off the Wall , '' `` Thriller '' and `` Bad '' -- and electrifying stage presence made him one of the most popular artists of all time , died Thursday , CNN has confirmed . Michael Jackson , shown in 2008 , was one of the biggest pop stars in history . He was 50 . He collapsed at his residence in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles , California , about noon Pacific time , suffering cardiac arrest , according to brother Randy Jackson . He died at UCLA Medical Center . Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office said an autopsy would probably be done on the singer Friday , with results expected that afternoon . Watch crowds gather at Jackson 's hospital '' `` Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color , '' the Rev. Al Sharpton said . `` To say an ` icon ' would only give these young people in Harlem a fraction of what he was . He was a historic figure that people will measure music and the industry by . '' Jackson 's blazing rise to stardom -- and later fall from grace -- is among the most startling of show business tales . The son of a steelworker , he rose to fame as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , a band he formed with his brothers in the late 1960s . By the late '70s , as a solo artist , he was topping the charts with cuts from `` Off the Wall , '' including `` Rock With You '' and `` Do n't Stop 'Til You Get Enough . '' Watch Jackson perform at a 1988 concert '' In 1982 , he released `` Thriller , '' an album that eventually produced seven hit singles . An appearance the next year on a Motown Records 25th-anniversary special cemented his status as the biggest star in the country . Timeline : The life of Michael Jackson '' For the rest of the 1980s , they came no bigger . `` Thriller 's '' follow-up , 1987 's `` Bad , '' sold almost as many copies . A new Jackson album -- a new Jackson appearance -- was a pop culture event . iReport : Share your memories of Michael Jackson The pop music landscape was changing , however , opening up for rap , hip-hop and what came to be called `` alternative '' -- and Jackson was seen as out of step . His next release , 1991 's `` Dangerous , '' debuted at No. 1 but `` only '' produced one top-ranking single -- `` Black or White '' -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending , in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch . And then `` Dangerous '' was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana 's `` Nevermind , '' an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics . After that , more attention was paid to Jackson 's private life than his music career , which faltered . A 1995 two-CD greatest hits , `` HIStory , '' sold relatively poorly , given the huge expense of Jackson 's recording contract : about 7 million copies , according to Recording Industry of America certifications . A 2001 album of new material , `` Invincible , '' did even worse . In 2005 , he went to trial on child-molestation charges . He was acquitted . In July 2008 , after three years away from the spotlight , Jackson announced a series of concerts at London 's O2 Arena as his `` curtain call . '' Some of the shows , initially scheduled to begin in July , were eventually postponed until 2010 . Watch the reaction to Jackson 's passing Rise to stardom Michael Jackson was born August 29 , 1958 , to Joe Jackson , a Gary , Indiana , steelworker , and his wife , Katherine . By the time he was 6 , he had joined his brothers in a musical group organized by his father , and by the time he was 10 , the group -- the Jackson 5 -- had been signed to Motown . Watch Michael Jackson 's life in video He made his first television appearance at age 11 . Jackson , a natural performer , soon became the group 's front man . Music critic Langdon Winner , reviewing the group 's first album , `` Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 , '' for Rolling Stone , praised Michael 's versatile singing and added , `` Who is this ` Diana Ross , ' anyway ? '' The group 's first four singles -- `` I Want You Back , '' `` ABC , '' `` The Love You Save '' and `` I 'll Be There '' -- went to No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart , the first time any group had pulled off that feat . There was even a Jackson 5 cartoon series on ABC . Watch reaction from Motown Studios '' In 1972 , he hit No. 1 as a solo artist with the song `` Ben . '' The group 's popularity waned as the '70s continued , and Michael eventually went solo full time . He played the Scarecrow in the 1978 movie version of `` The Wiz , '' and released the album `` Off the Wall '' in 1979 . Its success paved the way for `` Thriller , '' which eventually became the best-selling album in history , with 50 million copies sold worldwide . At that point , Michael Jackson became ubiquitous . Seven of `` Thriller 's '' nine cuts were released as singles ; all made the Top Ten . The then-new cable channel MTV , criticized for its almost exclusively white playlist , finally started playing Jackson 's videos . They aired incessantly , including a 14-minute minimovie of the title cut . -LRB- `` Weird Al '' Yankovic cemented his own stardom by lampooning Jackson 's song `` Beat It '' with a letter-perfect parody video . -RRB- On the Motown Records ' 25th-anniversary special -- a May 1983 TV extravaganza with notable turns by the Temptations , the Four Tops and Smokey Robinson -- it was Michael Jackson who stopped the show . Already he was the most popular musician in America , riding high with `` Thriller . '' But something about his electrifying performance of `` Billie Jean , '' complete with the patented backward dance moves , boosted his stardom to a new level . Watch Jackson perform `` Thiller '' '' People copied his Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved , zippered-jacket look . Showbiz veterans such as Fred Astaire praised his chops . He posed for photos with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the White House . Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets , two of which -- `` The Girl Is Mine '' and `` Say Say Say '' -- became top five hits . Jackson became a Pepsi spokesman , and when his hair caught fire while making a commercial , it was worldwide news . It all happened very fast -- within a couple years of the Motown special . But even at the time of the `` Motown 25 '' moonwalk , fame was old hat to Michael Jackson . He had n't even turned 25 himself , but he 'd been a star for more than half his life . He was given the nickname the `` King of Pop '' -- a spin on Elvis Presley 's status as `` the King of Rock 'n' Roll '' -- and few questioned the moniker . Relentless attention But , as the showbiz saying has it , when you 're on top of the world , there 's nowhere to go but down . The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real , some rumored -- as his music . As the Web site Allmusic.com notes , he was rumored to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber and to have purchased the bones of John Merrick , the `` Elephant Man . '' -LRB- Neither was true . -RRB- He did have a pet chimpanzee , Bubbles ; underwent a series of increasingly drastic plastic surgeries ; established an estate , Neverland , filled with zoo animals and amusement park rides ; and managed to purchase the Beatles catalog from under Paul McCartney 's nose , which displeased the ex-Beatle immensely . In 1990s and 2000s , Jackson found himself pasted across the media for his short-lived marriages , the first to Elvis Presley 's daughter , Lisa Marie ; his 2002 claim that then Sony Records head Tommy Mottola was racist ; his behavior and statements during a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir done for a documentary called `` Living With Michael Jackson ; '' his changing physical appearance ; and , above all , the accusations that he sexually molested young boys at Neverland .

He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets . Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block . However , an auction of material from Neverland , scheduled for April , was called off and all items returned to Jackson . Interest in Jackson never faded , however , even if some of it was prurient . In 2008 , when he announced 10 comeback shows in London , beginning in July 2009 , the story made worldwide news . The number of concerts was later increased to 50 . Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March . However , when the shows were postponed until 2010 , rumors swept the Internet that Jackson was not physically prepared and possibly suffering from skin cancer .

826,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Republican Sen . Ted Stevens of Alaska has been `` cleared '' by the Justice Department 's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him , his lawyer said Wednesday . Former Sen. Ted Stevens , 85 , of Alaska lost his re-election bid in November . Prosecutors accused Stevens of failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of `` freebies '' from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms . But in December , an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense , and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday . `` His name is cleared , '' Stevens ' lawyer , Brendan Sullivan , told reporters . `` He is innocent of the charges , as if they 'd never been brought . '' Stevens , 85 , lost his bid for a seventh full term in November after his conviction on seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms . Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of `` extraordinary evidence of government corruption . '' Watch more on the dismissal of the case '' `` Not only did the government fail to provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide , but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom , '' he said . And one of Stevens ' longtime friends , Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch , said Wednesday that Stevens was `` screwed by our own Justice Department . '' In a statement issued Wednesday morning , Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped . `` I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed , '' Stevens said . `` That day has finally come . '' U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department 's request to dismiss the case . Sullivan , who is not related to Stevens ' lawyer , excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point . In December , two months after the guilty verdicts , the FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen , an oil industry executive who was the government 's key witness . In the motion it filed Wednesday , the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen , the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska . The notes show that responses by Allen , the prosecution 's star witness , were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens , and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial , the motion says . `` In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial , '' Holder said in a written statement . Hatch , a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded `` elated , as anyone would . '' `` Here 's a guy who gave better than 60 years ' service to the country and was screwed -- screwed by our own Justice Department , '' Hatch said . But he praised Holder for `` standing up and fixing this foul situation . '' `` I think he 's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter , and it 's not an easy thing for him to do that , '' Hatch said . `` He has , in looking at it , realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right . '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , also commented on the Justice Department 's request , saying , `` Ted Stevens is 85 years old . He 's already been punished enough . I 'm satisfied . '' And in a statement Wednesday , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Stevens `` deserves to be very happy today . What a horrible thing he has endured . The blatant attempts by adversaries to destroy one 's reputation , career and finances are an abuse of our well-guarded process and violate our God-given rights afforded in the Constitution . `` It is a frightening thing to contemplate what we may be witnessing here -- the undermining of the political process through unscrupulous ploys and professional misconduct . Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope . It is unfortunate that , as a result of the questionable proceedings which led to Senator Stevens ' conviction days before the election , Alaskans lost an esteemed statesman on Capitol Hill . His presence is missed . '' The Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team 's conduct in Stevens ' case , Holder said . Asked whether the prosecutors should be charged themselves , Sullivan told reporters , `` That is not my job . I 'm a defense lawyer . '' During the trial , Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid `` hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies '' he received from Allen 's company , VECO , and from Allen himself . Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens ' Alaska home , prosecutors said .

828,"Editor 's note : Dr. John Boyce , chief of the Infectious Diseases Section at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven , Connecticut , was lead author of the Centers for Disease Control 's national hand hygiene guidelines for health-care workers and heads the Hand Hygiene Resource Center . Dr. John Boyce says hands contaminated with virus are often a pathway for people to develop flu . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus -LRB- also known as swine flu -RRB- from Mexico to at least 19 other countries in less than 10 days is a cause of major concern . It emphasizes the need for the public to become familiar with how influenza is spread and which preventive measures they can use to reduce their chances of becoming infected . Although little information is available at this time , it appears that this influenza virus spreads from one person to another in the same way as other influenza viruses -- by `` droplet spread . '' Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes and expels droplets of fluid . Those droplets travel short distances -LRB- usually less than three feet -RRB- through the air and can be deposited on the mouth or in the nose of people or on surfaces . Those who develop influenza often shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions for several days after they become ill . Experience with other viruses suggests that individuals with influenza can contaminate their hands when coughing , sneezing or blowing their noses . The virus can survive on the hands for at least one hour . If a person whose hands are heavily contaminated touches a surface such as a doorknob , table or computer keyboard , they can deposit the virus onto that surface , where it can survive for minutes to several hours . One study conducted with a regular seasonal strain of influenza virus found that the virus could survive on facial tissues for several minutes and for two to eight hours on stainless steel or plastic surfaces . If another person touches a contaminated surface with his hands when the virus is still alive and then touches his own mouth or nose , he may become infected . Infection might also occur when a person with influenza shakes hands with another person who subsequently touches their own mouth or nose with their fingers . Several studies have found that many people touch their noses or mouths several times an hour during the course of daily activities . So there are plenty of opportunities for people to inadvertently introduce a flu virus into their bodies if their hands become contaminated . As a result , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- recommends that individuals perform hand hygiene -- also known as hand washing or decontamination -- frequently during influenza outbreaks . In addition to reducing the risk of developing influenza , hand hygiene can help protect people from becoming ill with several other respiratory viruses by eliminating these organisms from the hands . A recent study found that hand washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer were both highly effective in reducing a seasonal strain of influenza virus on the hands . This should also be true for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus . Either plain soap or antimicrobial soap will reduce the amount of virus on the hands . To ensure decontamination , be sure to wash your hands vigorously and keep both soap and water on your hands for at least 15 seconds . When sinks are not readily available , alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a convenient and effective way of eliminate the virus from hands . Use an amount of sanitizer at least the size of quarter or enough to keep your hands wet for at least 15 to 20 seconds while you 're rubbing them together . The CDC also recommends that people should avoid touching their mouths , noses and eyes , since surfaces they touch may be contaminated when flu virus is present . People who develop influenza or other respiratory viral infections should also clean their hands after blowing their nose or after covering a cough with their hands . Since droplet spread is the most common way influenza is transmitted from person to person , the CDC also recommends avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick . If you do become ill with influenza , the CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others . Hand hygiene is an important tool in preventing infection from influenza viruses such as this recent strain and is an easy and effective way to prevent contracting infectious diseases in general . Take the time to educate yourself about proper hand hygiene to protect both yourself and your family . Note : Further information about the 2009 H1N1 influenza -LRB- swine flu -RRB- outbreak can be obtained by going to CDC 's Web site .

829,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The H1N1 flu virus could cause up to 90,000 U.S. deaths , mainly among children and young adults , if it resurges this fall as expected , according to a report released Monday by a presidential advisory panel . The report urges speedier production of the H1N1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by September . The H1N1 virus , commonly known as swine flu virus , could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the American population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million U.S. hospital admissions , the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported . The report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a `` plausible scenario '' involving large outbreaks at schools , inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective . Up to 40,000 U.S. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year , with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65 . With seasonal flu and H1N1 , this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place `` enormous stress '' on intensive care units nationwide , which normally operate near capacity , the report says . An H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September , at the beginning of the school year , and infections may peak in mid-October , according to the report . However , the H1N1 vaccine is n't expected to be available until mid-October , and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity , the report says . Watch more on H1N1 predictions for this fall '' The potential `` mismatch in timing '' could significantly diminish the usefulness of the H1N1 vaccine , the report says . `` Even with the best efforts , this will cause some illness , some severe illness and unfortunately , some deaths , '' Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Monday . `` But a lot so far has gone remarkably right , '' Frieden said . `` There 's a vaccine well on its way to being distributed , diagnostic tests available in well over 100 laboratories , treatments pre-positioned around the country ... and guidance issued for health care providers , schools , businesses and other communities . '' Among the report 's recommendations are for government agencies to : • Prepare several `` planning scenarios '' to determine demand for supplies and care . • Set up surveillance systems to track information about influenza-like illnesses . • Develop plans to protect the public 's most vulnerable groups , such as pregnant women and those with pre-existing medical conditions . • Speed up the production of the H1N1 vaccine and have an initial batch -- enough to vaccinate up to 40 million people , especially those who are at risk of serious disease -- by mid-September . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the government 's preparation and guidance for the public was based on the need to strike a balance `` on a continuum of being paralyzed with fear versus complacency . '' So far , clinical trials for the H1N1 vaccine have not indicated adverse side effects beyond what are experienced with the seasonal flu vaccine , Sebelius said . However , there would be no formal decision to launch a vaccination campaign until those trials were complete , she said . That decision would be hers , she said , and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary . Pregnant women , health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population , Sebelius has said . Adults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the H1N1 virus . H1N1 preparation guidelines for the nation 's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago . The plans are available at the Web site www.flu.gov . The H1N1 vaccine would require two shots , the second three weeks after the first . Immunity to the virus would not kick in until two weeks after the second shot . The World Health Organization declared the H1N1 virus a global pandemic on June 11 . More than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring , a WHO official said last week .

830,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Susan Atkins , a terminally ill former Charles Manson follower convicted in the murder of actress Sharon Tate , on Tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison . Susan Atkins , Califorina 's longest-serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot . Atkins , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said . In June , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live . The California Board of Parole Hearings ' decision -- posted Tuesday on its Web site -- came after a public hearing on Atkins ' request . It means the request will not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced Atkins . The court would have had the final say on Atkins ' release . Her attorney , Eric P. Lampel , called the parole board 's decision `` unfortunate . '' '' -LSB- The board -RSB- ignored the vast majority of evidence presented , '' Lampel said . `` There was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses . It apparently fell on deaf ears . '' Known within the Manson Family as Sadie Mae Glutz , Atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including Tate , in August 1969 . According to historical accounts of the murder , Atkins stabbed Tate , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski . By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times . Atkins ' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized Los Angeles and left seven people dead . It polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars . Atkins told a 1993 parole board that Tate pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down . `` She asked me to let her baby live , '' Atkins said . '' ... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . '' Three of Tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back . Atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman . One of the first people Atkins confessed to was Virginia Graham , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the Manson Family was responsible for the murders . Graham said last month she believed Atkins should die in prison . `` She showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none , '' Graham said . `` So why should anybody show her mercy at this time ? '' Sharon Tate 's sister , Debra , has staunchly opposed Atkins ' release . `` She will be set free when judged by God , '' Debra Tate has said . `` It 's important that she die in incarceration . '' Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said Monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be `` an affront to people of this state , the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims . '' Cooley noted in his letter that Atkins was initially sentenced to death , like others in the Manson Family , including its leader , Charles Manson . Their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time . California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday he was also opposed to releasing Atkins . `` I do n't believe in -LSB- compassionate release -RSB- , '' the governor told reporters . `` I think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time . '' Even if Atkins is dying , Schwarzenegger said , `` Those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I 'm not for the compassionate release . '' Earlier , Suzan Hubbard , director of adult prisons in California , also recommended against granting Atkins ' request . Vincent Bugliosi , who prosecuted Atkins and other members of the Manson Family , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money . Through Monday , the cost for Atkins ' medical care since she was hospitalized March 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton . Terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show . In 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , Thornton has said . Ten were approved . Atkins , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is California 's longest-serving female inmate . According to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse , she is now a born-again Christian . During her incarceration , the site says , Atkins worked to help at-risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others . The Web site does not mention Atkins ' illness . Lampel said last month Atkins is paralyzed on one side . `` She can talk a little bit , '' Lampel said . `` She ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee . '' Atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes . `` I know the pain I caused Mrs. Tate , '' she said at a parole board hearing in 1985 . ln May , authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County , California , ranch where Manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there . Nothing was found , authorities said . CNN 's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report .",how many times was the stabs,stabbing the pregnant woman 16
831,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attorneys representing Casey Anthony invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 60 times during a deposition given in a civil suit against her , according to a transcript of the proceedings . In addition , Anthony 's attorney Charles Greene asserted he would also invoke the Fifth Amendment on her behalf if questioning delved into the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter , Caylee . Anthony , who was acquitted in July of murder charges in Caylee 's death , is being sued in civil court by a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez . When Caylee was reported missing in July 2008 -- a month after she was last seen -- Anthony maintained she had been kidnapped by her nanny , Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez . Authorities were never able to find the nanny . But they did find Gonzalez , who claimed she never met Anthony or her daughter . Gonzalez 's attorneys claim , according to questions asked of Anthony in the October 8 deposition , that Gonzalez was questioned by the police in Caylee 's disappearance , was kicked out of her apartment complex , lost her job and that she and her two daughters received death threats as a result of media attention in the case . Anthony herself said little in the deposition , but did acknowledge she was aware she was being sued by Gonzalez . She also said she has not spoken to her brother , Lee , in the past six months , and has not spoken to her parents , George and Cindy Anthony , since October 14 , 2008 . However , Greene did not permit her to answer questions including whether she had ever met Gonzalez ; whether a person named Zenaida was ever a nanny to Caylee ; or whether defense attorney Jose Baez 's assertion during Anthony 's criminal trial , that Zenaida Gonzalez was one of Anthony 's `` imaginary friends , '' was true . She also was not allowed to answer questions about whether she considered herself a good mother to Caylee ; the last day she saw the 2-year-old alive ; and whether she drowned in the Anthonys ' pool in June 2008 , as the defense claimed during Anthony 's criminal trial . Asked why he was invoking Anthony 's right against self-incrimination , Greene said , according to the transcript , `` I need not explain our factual basis other than to tell you that it could tend to incriminate and provide a link in the chain of evidence that could be used against -LRB- Anthony -RRB- . '' Asked by Gonzalez 's attorney John Morgan what pending criminal case that applies to , Greene said , `` We made our objection and that 's all I 'm going to state . '' Morgan told Greene he anticipates a hearing before a judge on a motion to compel Anthony to answer some of these questions . Greene said that taking it to a judge is `` the best thing to do . '' While Anthony was acquitted on murder charges in Caylee 's death , she was convicted on four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child 's disappearance . She was given credit for time already spent behind bars , however , and was released from jail July 17 . She has remained in seclusion since then , although a judge ruled she must serve a year of probation stemming from her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges . The transcript of the deposition notes that Anthony participated via videoconference from `` an undisclosed location . '' `` I hope that you and your counsel understand that we did not ask questions that many people may have wished we did concerning your employment history then or now , where you live , where you stay , '' Morgan told Anthony as questioning wrapped up . '' ... We did this , this deposition , in pursuit of truth and not in pursuit of sensation . '' Anthony has also been ordered to repay more than $ 217,000 to authorities for the costs of investigating Caylee 's disappearance .

The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo , Oklahoma , late Sunday , the bureau said . Her mother , Tonya Hobbs , 37 , was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night , the bureau said . Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs ' estranged husband , Lester William Hobbs , at his sister 's home , the bureau said . Lester Hobbs , 46 , and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbs ' car , said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her . Lester Hobbs is not Aja 's biological father , police said . Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert , Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said . Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport , Texas , and the alert was issued preemptively , she said . Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night . Authorities did not say how Hobbs died , but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her . The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs , and was parked at his relatives ' home , Richard Goss , agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation 's Lawton , Oklahoma , office , told reporters Monday . Hobbs ' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja , and one of them pried open the door and discovered Tanya Hobbs ' body , he said . Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone , Goss said . The Hobbses were separated , but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile , Goss said . The couple had been together for about five years . A medical examiner was performing an autopsy , the bureau said , and police want to question Lester Hobbs about the death . He and the girl are believed to be traveling in his car , a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW . The two-door car has no hubcaps , and the rear passenger window is covered in plastic , the bureau said . The Comanche County , Oklahoma , Sheriff 's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication . `` Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl , '' Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters . `` We know that she does need some medication , '' and authorities were checking leads regarding that , he said . He did not specify Aja 's medical condition . Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate . The Sheriff 's Office said he had prior felony convictions . Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County , Oklahoma , on a DUI charge , Goss said , and did not appear , so a warrant has been issued for him . Aja 's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November , according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . At a hearing , Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl 's father , John Johnson , agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs , the documents said . Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds , Goss said . She has brown eyes , and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black . Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds , with hazel eyes and brown hair , according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation .

833,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The wife of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid underwent neck surgery Friday after being injured with their daughter in a four-vehicle wreck in suburban Washington a day earlier , her surgeon said . Since the surgery , Landra Reid , 69 , has been able `` to get out of bed , her pain is well-controlled and she 's able to swallow some , '' said Dr. Elizabeth Franco of Inova Fairfax Hospital . She can move her arms and legs , but is expected to go through physical therapy before being released in a few days , Franco said . Reid 's wife broke her neck , a vertebra in her lower back and her nose , the doctor said . The couple 's adult daughter , Lana Reid Barringer of McLean , Virginia , suffered a neck injury and facial lacerations , the senator 's spokesman , Jon Summers , said Thursday . Lana Reid was released from the hospital Thursday night . The wreck occurred in the northbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Fairfax County at 1:10 p.m. , when the 2005 Honda Odyssey driven by the daughter began braking in stop-and-go traffic and was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer , according to a Virginia State Police report . `` The impact forced the Honda Odyssey to rear-end the vehicle in front of it , a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee , '' it says . `` The Jeep Grand Cherokee was then forced into the next lane over where it struck a 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt . '' The drivers of the Jeep and the Chevrolet also were taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital . Their injuries were not considered life-threatening . The driver of the truck , Allan W. Snader , 59 , of Ohio , was charged with reckless driving , the police report said . He was not injured in the crash . The tractor-trailer was carrying rolls of plastic .

836,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes . Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over allaged war crimes in Darfur . Al-Bashir landed in Qatar on Sunday and met with Qatar 's emir , Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani . On Monday , he expressed his gratitude to the Arab League Summit . `` We appreciate your support for Sudan in many areas , '' al-Bashir said . `` This support will , God willing , lead to issuing clear and unequivocal decisions -- rejecting the decision -LSB- the ICC arrest warrant -RSB- . '' U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also attended the meeting but avoided any confrontation with al-Bashir . The U.N. leader focused instead on efforts to have humanitarian aid workers allowed back into Sudan . Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant . The March 4 arrest warrant is the first issued for a sitting head of state by the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal , based at The Hague in the Netherlands . But the ICC has no arrest powers and depends on its 106 member states to take suspects into custody . Qatar , site of the summit , is not a member of the tribunal . Sudan refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC , and has made no efforts to hand over two other officials indicted by the court . Al-Bashir has called the charges an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan . The International Criminal Court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government 's campaign against rebels in Darfur , in western Sudan . The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict . Qatar had been mediating talks between Sudanese officials and representatives of one of the rebel factions , who signed a confidence-building agreement in February . At the State Department , deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur . `` We would hope that while -LSB- al-Bashir -RSB- is in Doha that the Arab League would focus on the immediate and urgent needs of the people on the ground in Sudan and address the humanitarian situation in Darfur and meet the priorities of the comprehensive peace agreement , '' he said . `` The discussions should be on how to stop the violence and support the people . `` The presence of Bashir at this conference should be used as an opportunity to bring forth the international concern to what is happening in Darfur and southern Sudan . '' In another development , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi walked out of the summit after a dispute over whether he would be allowed to talk . `` I am an international leader , '' Gadhafi said before leaving . `` The dean of Arab rulers . The king of kings in Africa . The imam to Muslims . My international position does not allow me to be reduced . Thank you . '' State Department spokesman Duguid declined to comment .

841,"MUNICH , Germany -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alleged Nazi camp guard John Demjanjuk had no choice but to bring Jews to their deaths in extermination camps , Demjanjuk 's defense argued Monday as his long-awaited trial got under way . Demjanjuk , 89 , faces charges of being an accessory to about 27,900 murders during World War II . But his defense attorney , Ulrich Busch , said Monday the court was imposing a `` moral and judicial double standard . '' The retired auto worker from Cleveland , Ohio -- a native Ukrainian -- was a prisoner of war during the conflict , and would have been killed had he not done what the Nazis ordered , the defense team argued . The defense line that Demjanjuk was forced to help the Nazis represents a change for the defendant , who has denied in the past that he was a camp guard . The guards forced to help the Nazis were `` victims , not culprits -- survivors , not murderers , '' defense lawyer Busch said . Higher-ranking German SS officers in a similar situation have been found not guilty of war crimes , the defense argued . The Munich state prosecutor brought the charges against Demjanjuk for his alleged role at the Sobibor death camp in Poland , where the Nazis and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people , according to the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum . About 30 relatives of victims have joined the prosecution case . In Germany it is possible for the families to join the prosecution case as co-plaintiffs , representing named individuals who died in the death camps . If Demjanjuk is found guilty , it will not be only for 27,900 anonymous murders , but for the murders of victims specifically named by the co-plantiffs . There are very few remaining survivors of Sobibor . Demjanjuk 's defenders say he was a Soviet prisoner of war at the Trawniki camp , where Nazis trained prisoners to assist with the extermination of about 2 million Jews in occupied Poland . Those prisoners of war had no choice but to assist , the defense said . Demjanjuk was brought into the court in a wheelchair , accompanied by medical personnel and a German-Ukrainian translator . He did not speak in the opening phase of the trial , and had his eyes shut most of the time . The trial is expected to last until May of next year . He was deported in May from the United States to Germany . The German court originally accused him of complicity in about 29,000 murders . The prosecutor 's office said it revised the number because some of those who had allegedly died in the camp when Demjanjuk was there were already dead during the transport to Sobibor . Demjanjuk lost a U.S. Supreme Court case against his deportation . His lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he was too ill and frail to be sent overseas . They also raised human rights and other legal issues . The Munich State Court ruled earlier this year he was fit to stand trial . But doctors have restricted the time he can be tried each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each , said Anton Winkler , Munich state prosecutor . The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s , when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as `` Ivan the Terrible . '' His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981 , and he was extradited to Israel in 1986 . Demjanjuk was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death , but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was `` Ivan the Terrible . '' A federal court restored Demjanjuk 's citizenship , ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case . But his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard .

843,"BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut , killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders , according to American and Lebanese officials . Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut . The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries , and the sole passenger walked away unscathed , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said . Both were Lebanese nationals , he said . An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries , the spokesman said . Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut 's Dora area , contradicting earlier reports of four . Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion , which was caused by a 15-kilogram -LRB- 33-pound -RRB- bomb placed in a car before the explosion , the security forces said . The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack , said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia . `` I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded , and certainly to the families of those who were killed , that our condolences are with them , '' she added . It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb . A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack , and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy . But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target . `` We do n't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened , who is responsible , who is exactly being targeted , '' he told reporters during the State Department 's daily briefing . `` We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us . '' Citing security concerns , McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman . A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night `` out of respect to the victims of today 's terrorist explosion . '' In addition to the American , an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast , according to a Western diplomatic source . Video of the scene showed several damaged cars , including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal . A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage . Mohammed Chatah , senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , pointed out that the attack happened during `` a major political crisis '' in Lebanon , which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud . `` This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation , '' Chatah told CNN . Tuesday 's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western , anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital . Most recently , an explosion in Beirut 's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj , the head of operations for the Lebanese army , and his bodyguard on December 12 . Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president . Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president . The nation has been without a president since November 23 , when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term . In February 2005 , the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon .

During the dance at the university 's student center , a fire alarm was pulled at 12:26 a.m. , campus police Maj. Ron Blicher told reporters . More than 300 people who were attending the dance left the building and spilled out into the street . A fight broke out between two groups , and Howard and another person were stabbed , police said .

Hood , 21 , was arrested in connection to the fight -- not for the stabbing -- and charged with interfering with an officer and breach of peace , according to a police report . He was released on $ 100,000 bond . Hood 's attorney said his client was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time , WTNH reported Monday .

848,"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates flew into Iraq on Monday to oversee a change of command of American forces . Robert Gates is greeted Monday at Baghdad International Airport by Army Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin . Gen. Ray Odierno will take over command Tuesday from Gen. David Petraeus , whose 20-month term in Iraq saw a significant decline in violence with the deployment of additional U.S. troops . U.S. forces are in `` mission transition , '' Gates said Monday , with some troops going home and others backing up Iraqis . `` There is no question we will still be engaged , but the areas in which we are seriously engaged will continue to narrow , '' Gates said during his flight to Iraq . `` The challenge for Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains we 've already achieved and expand on them even as the number of U.S. forces are shrinking . '' Odierno is expected to set the stage for an eventual U.S. withdrawal . Petraeus will become the new chief of U.S. Central Command , in charge of American forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan . Gates , who is making his eighth trip to Iraq , said Petraeus played a `` historic role '' during his tenure . `` I think he would be the first to acknowledge that he has had a brilliant strategy , '' he said . `` But it has been the brigade commanders and company commanders and the soldiers and Marines and others on the ground who have actually made it work . `` We have lost a lot of lives , but it 's really been an extraordinary effort of translations of a great strategy into a great success in a very difficult circumstance . '' At a dinner on the eve of the change-of-command ceremony , Gates presented Petraeus with the Defense Superior Service Medal . He also gave Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , the Distinguished Civilian Service Award -- the highest award given by the secretary of Defense to those not in uniform . `` I have never seen a working relationship like this , '' Gates told the two men . `` To find leaders to do what many considered impossible , you two are such men . '' Odierno will receive his fourth star on Tuesday in a separate ceremony ahead of the change-of-command ceremony . The defense secretary on Monday also met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and told the Iraqi leader that he has seen a notable improvement in security since his first visit to the country nearly two years ago , according to a statement released by the prime minister 's office . Gates said the cooperation between Iraqi security forces and coalition forces was responsible for the improvement in security , according to the statement , and al-Maliki praised the successes of the Iraqi armed forces . The prime minister said the gains have brought about a greater sense of normalcy in the country , allowing many internally displaced Iraqis to return to their homes . They also have spurred the economy , he said . The situation in Iraq is far different from that in past years , the prime minister noted . As Gates arrived in Iraq , three bombings -- two in Baghdad and one in Diyala province 's Balad Ruz -- provided a rude counterpoint to that message . Two car bombs went off in central Baghdad . The blasts killed 12 people and wounded 36 in the commercial area of the Karrada district , an Interior Ministry official said . The U.S. blamed al Qaeda in Iraq , but gave a lower death toll , saying two `` possible '' car bombs killed six people and wounded 27 . In Balad Ruz , a female suicide bomber detonated explosives at the house of a former U.S. detainee , killing at least 22 people and wounding 33 , according to a Diyala security official . The U.S. military also blamed al Qaeda in Iraq for a car bombing Friday in Dujail , north of Baghdad .

849,"Moscow , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of opposition demonstrators marched in front of the parliament building in Kiev , Ukraine , Saturday , protesting a deal reached earlier this week to extend Russia 's military presence in the former Soviet Republic , national news media reported . Parliamentary opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- told protesters Saturday that the ratification of the treaty must be prevented at all costs . She claimed that Yanukovych is `` selling out '' Ukraine , has `` openly embarked on the path of destruction of -LSB- Ukraine 's -RSB- national interests , and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state 's sovereignty , '' according to a transcript of the speech on her website . After the deal was signed Wednesday by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017 . Saturday , protesters reportedly adopted a resolution calling the agreement an `` unprecedented act of national treason and disgrace , '' and calling on all opposition groups to unite against it . According to Tymoshenko 's website , some 10,000 people gathered at the rally . But Ukrainian national news agency UNIAN estimated the number of protesters at 5,000 . The deal extends Russia 's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol , Ukraine , for an additional 25 years , in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine . The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices , which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine . The dispute affected not only Ukrainians , but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine . The two countries had been at odds ever since the `` Orange Revolution '' swept Yanukovych 's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005 . Throughout his time in office , Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia 's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol . The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017 . `` The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet 's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia , '' Yanukovych said Wednesday . `` We understand that the Black Sea Fleet will be one of the guarantors of security on the Black Sea . '' The Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych , who hails from predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine , trounced Yushchenko in national elections last January . The Russian president said the new deal added a `` concrete and pragmatic dimension '' to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians . Opposition groups in Ukraine , however , were quick to denounce the agreement . Yuschenko 's `` Our Ukraine '' party said the treaty would lead to the `` Russification '' of Ukraine . Opposition activists decided Saturday to stage another protest in front of parliament April 27 , when the deal will be put to a ratification vote .

850,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq , President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada . On Wednesday in Kansas City , Missouri , Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that `` then , as now , people argued that the real problem was America 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , '' according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House . `` Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left , '' Bush will say . `` Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president will say . The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility , citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam , according to the excerpts . `` Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' Bush will say . On Tuesday , Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said , `` President Bush 's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history . `` While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government . It is time to change direction in Iraq , and Congress will again work to do so in the fall . '' The White House is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the American Legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad . President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in Iraq until the report comes out in September . Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government '' It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill , particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . Earlier this month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin . Bush 's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq . In addition to his analogy to Vietnam , Bush in Wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia , including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` In the aftermath of Japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy . Then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' Bush will say . `` Today , in defiance of the critics , Japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' Speaking about the Korean War , Bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that America 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges , America never broke its word , '' Bush will say . `` Without America 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war , millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

851,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain said Thursday it expects Iceland to live up to its obligations , two days after Iceland 's president refused to sign a bill that would pay back billions of dollars Iceland owes the country . Britain spent 2.3 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.69 billion -RRB- last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed . Under a European Union directive , Iceland owes compensation to Britain . Iceland 's parliament passed a bill last week authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds , but President Olafur Ragnar Grimmson refused to sign it Tuesday . It means there will now be a public referendum on whether to approve the bill . It also puts into question whether Britain can get repaid . `` We expect Iceland to live up to its obligations , '' said a British Treasury spokesman , who was not authorized to give his name . `` We support them in finding a way to do that . '' Similar comments came from Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos , whose government spent 1.3 billion euros -LRB- $ 1.87 billion -RRB- to cover bank losses in the country . Despite his refusal to sign the bill , Grimmson told CNN Wednesday that Iceland will not shirk its duty to repay the money . `` Iceland recognizes its obligations under this agreement , '' he said . Resolving the issue , he added , `` is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries . '' Grimmson acknowledged that the referendum puts repayment in doubt , though he said at the very least , Icelandic opinion polls show the vote will be `` very close . '' He did not explain how Iceland would repay the money if voters reject the bill . Britain and the Netherlands said it was too early to speculate on what might happen if voters in Iceland vote no , but both Bos and the British Treasury spokesman said it would have negative consequences internationally for the small Atlantic nation . `` If the referendum goes against us , then I think Iceland will have a big problem because they will have shown themselves to be very unreliable partners in the international financial scene , '' Bos told CNN . Bos said non-repayment of the funds would affect `` the long-term interest of the Iceland economy and the Iceland people . '' In a statement Tuesday , Grimmson said the reason he refused to sign the bill was so it would go to a referendum , which is required by law in such a case . He said he received a petition over the weekend , signed by a quarter of the electorate , urging the decision be put to a public vote . `` It is the cornerstone of the constitutional structure of the Republic of Iceland that the people are the supreme judge of the validity of the law , '' Grimmson said in the statement . The law passed by Iceland 's parliament would compensate Britain and the Netherlands by 2024 . The International Monetary Fund approved a loan of $ 2.1 billion to Iceland in November , making repayment of the British and Dutch funds a requirement . It is unclear how the IMF loan would be affected if Icelandic voters were to reject the repayment bill .",How much did Dutch authorities spend ?,1.3 billion euros -LRB- $ 1.87 billion

In addition to his conservative news columns , which he wrote until 2005 , he wrote a language column for the paper 's Sunday magazine from 1979 until shortly before his death . He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978 . In 2006 , President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest U.S. civilian honor . Safire had suffered from pancreatic cancer and died Sunday at a hospice in Rockville , Maryland , the newspaper reported . Born in New York in 1929 , Safire began his career as a reporter for newspapers , television and radio stations after dropping out of Syracuse University . After becoming a public relations executive in the late 1950s , he was credited with putting together the 1959 `` kitchen debate '' between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev at that year 's American National Exhibition in Moscow . Safire was the publicist for a builder at the time . `` What I was publicizing was the typical American house , '' he recounted during a conference at George Washington University in July . `` It was my kitchen . '' The next year , he went to work for Nixon 's first , unsuccessful presidential bid . He rejoined the Nixon team in 1968 , when the Republican eventually won the White House , and became one of the administration 's top speechwriters . Perhaps his best-known line in that job was Vice President Spiro Agnew 's denunciation of journalists as `` nattering nabobs of negativism . '' But Safire left the administration to join that nattering club in 1973 , when he left the Nixon administration to join the Times . His often-pugnacious voice -- he once denounced then-first lady Hillary Clinton as a `` congenital liar '' -- held down the right flank of the Times ' op-ed page for more than three decades . He won his Pulitzer in 1978 for columns on the travails surrounding Bert Lance , who as President Carter 's budget director in 1977 resigned amid allegations of bank fraud . Lance was acquitted by a federal jury in 1980 . And he was an outspoken advocate of the plight of Iraq 's Kurdish population . He sharply criticized U.S. support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in the 1980s , when Hussein used poison gas to put down a Kurdish revolt , and he strongly supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , writing that `` nobody came out of this war more nobly '' than the Kurds . Safire also wrote four novels , several collections of columns and a political dictionary that was first published in 1968 . A new edition came out in 2008 . He is survived by his wife , Helene , two children and one grandchild .",What did William Safire die from at age 79 ?,a battle with pancreatic cancer
854,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- African-Americans are extremely supportive of President Obama , but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year , according to a new national poll . The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey , released Tuesday , also indicates that Obama 's presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations , but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country . More than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job Obama 's doing in the White House , far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president . But when asked how they personally feel about Obama 's presidency , only 42 percent of black respondents say they 're thrilled , with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled . The 42 percent who are thrilled is down from 61 percent in January , when Obama was inaugurated . `` African-Americans are still big fans of the first black president in U.S. history , but the thrill is gone , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . According to the poll , 51 percent of African-Americans say Obama 's presidency has brought some improvement in race relations in the U.S. , but only 18 percent feel it 's the start of a new era . Another 23 percent say they 've seen a real change in race relations over the past 11 months and 7 percent say things have gotten worse . The survey indicates that three-quarters of blacks believe race relations will improve eventually , which is up from 49 percent of blacks who felt that way a year before Obama was elected . `` Whites take a dimmer view of Obama 's effect on race relations , with a third believing that the new presidency has not changed race relations in the country and 15 percent of whites saying that Obama has made race relations worse , '' Holland added . `` Not surprisingly , whites are less supportive of Obama , although for a notable number of whites , their negative view of the president is due to the perception that he 's not been liberal enough . '' The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 16-20 , with 1,160 adult Americans , including 259 African-Americans and 786 whites , questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6 percentage points for the African-Americans sample .

855,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain said Thursday it expects Iceland to live up to its obligations , two days after Iceland 's president refused to sign a bill that would pay back billions of dollars Iceland owes the country . Britain spent 2.3 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.69 billion -RRB- last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed . Under a European Union directive , Iceland owes compensation to Britain . Iceland 's parliament passed a bill last week authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds , but President Olafur Ragnar Grimmson refused to sign it Tuesday . It means there will now be a public referendum on whether to approve the bill . It also puts into question whether Britain can get repaid . `` We expect Iceland to live up to its obligations , '' said a British Treasury spokesman , who was not authorized to give his name . `` We support them in finding a way to do that . '' Similar comments came from Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos , whose government spent 1.3 billion euros -LRB- $ 1.87 billion -RRB- to cover bank losses in the country . Despite his refusal to sign the bill , Grimmson told CNN Wednesday that Iceland will not shirk its duty to repay the money . `` Iceland recognizes its obligations under this agreement , '' he said . Resolving the issue , he added , `` is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries . '' Grimmson acknowledged that the referendum puts repayment in doubt , though he said at the very least , Icelandic opinion polls show the vote will be `` very close . '' He did not explain how Iceland would repay the money if voters reject the bill . Britain and the Netherlands said it was too early to speculate on what might happen if voters in Iceland vote no , but both Bos and the British Treasury spokesman said it would have negative consequences internationally for the small Atlantic nation . `` If the referendum goes against us , then I think Iceland will have a big problem because they will have shown themselves to be very unreliable partners in the international financial scene , '' Bos told CNN . Bos said non-repayment of the funds would affect `` the long-term interest of the Iceland economy and the Iceland people . '' In a statement Tuesday , Grimmson said the reason he refused to sign the bill was so it would go to a referendum , which is required by law in such a case . He said he received a petition over the weekend , signed by a quarter of the electorate , urging the decision be put to a public vote . `` It is the cornerstone of the constitutional structure of the Republic of Iceland that the people are the supreme judge of the validity of the law , '' Grimmson said in the statement . The law passed by Iceland 's parliament would compensate Britain and the Netherlands by 2024 . The International Monetary Fund approved a loan of $ 2.1 billion to Iceland in November , making repayment of the British and Dutch funds a requirement . It is unclear how the IMF loan would be affected if Icelandic voters were to reject the repayment bill .",How many billions did Dutch authorities spent ?,1.3 billion euros
857,"Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in last week 's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood urged in 2007 that Muslims in the U.S. Army be allowed to claim conscientious objector status when it comes to fighting other Muslims in war , a defense official said Tuesday . Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan also discussed religious aspects of Islam during a presentation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as part of a final project for his residency tenure , said the official , who has knowledge of the investigation into Hasan . `` It 's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims , '' Hasan said , according to a slide show that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . `` Muslims -LSB- sic -RSB- soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting/killing believers unjustly , '' a Hasan slide said , though he added that individual feelings `` will vary ! '' Hasan is the only suspect in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on Thursday that left 13 people dead and 42 wounded . Twelve of the dead were soldiers . Hasan remains in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas , after having been shot by a police officer . Dr. Val Finnell , a former medical school classmate of Hasan 's , described him as '' a very outspoken opponent of the war '' in the classroom and in public settings . `` He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam , '' Finnell said . He added that he was shocked by Thursday 's shooting . `` However , that said , given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people , I am not surprised . '' Hasan 's comments came in what was supposed to be a medical seminar , The Washington Post reported , but instead he spoke to senior Army doctors about Islam . Hasan , a psychiatrist , aimed to describe `` religious conflicts that Muslims may have with the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' according to the newspaper 's report . The report is based on a slideshow that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation . See the presentation and the Post 's report In a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation `` indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . '' Hasan came under investigation for a time last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric 's communications , a federal law enforcement official said . An employee of the Defense Department 's Criminal Investigative Services , assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force , ultimately made the decision to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan 's personnel files . However , a senior defense department official said late Tuesday that the agency was not aware of any such communication . `` Contrary to reports we have seen in some news outlets , based on what we know now , neither the United States Army nor any other organization within the Department of Defense knew of Major Hasan 's contacts with any Muslim extremists , '' the official said . `` Not until after the tragic shooting at Fort Hood last week were Major Hasan 's e-mail communications first brought to our attention by federal investigators . '' President Obama traveled to Fort Hood for a memorial service on Tuesday for the victims of the shooting . Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other dignitaries also attended the service . Read profiles of the shooting victims Hasan , 39 , was wounded several times during the attack . His ventilator was removed over the weekend , and he began talking afterward , hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said . Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday , but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney , according to senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation . Hasan has retained a lawyer , ex-military judge and retired Army Col. John Galligan , the attorney told CNN affiliate KXXV-TV . `` Like anybody that 's facing criminal charges in the military arena , he 's entitled to a defense counsel , '' Galligan told the station . Galligan said he had a 25-minute conversation with Hasan , and the two did not talk much about the Fort Hood shooting . `` There 's still a lot to be done on the medical side , '' Galligan said . Hasan , a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997 . He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military . Hasan , a Muslim , also told his family that he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 . In August , he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read `` Allah is Love '' was torn off . A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint .",What did Hasan 's former classmate say about him ?,a very outspoken opponent of the war '' in the classroom and in public settings
859,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 7-year-old boy from El Paso , Texas , was gunned down across the border in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general 's office told CNN Tuesday . Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout , spokesman Arturo Sandoval said . At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez 's dad , Sandoval said . The father , Raul Ramirez Alvarado , 35 , died in the driver 's seat . The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle , but was apparently shot in the back , Sandoval said . The boy 's body fell forward in front of the vehicle . The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday . No arrests had been made as of Tuesday , the spokesman said . Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso , Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN . `` It 's a senseless tragedy that we 're trying to come to terms with , '' she said . According to El Paso County records , Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed . The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso , Ayala said . It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district . Raul 's classmates were spared the details of his death , but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy 's passing . Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers , Ayala said . More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez , out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people . A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world . According to statistics from local prosecutors , Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day . The bloodiest month this year has been September , with 476 killings reported . The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso , but as Friday 's shooting showed , the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other . Because of the ongoing investigation , Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father , but added that at least 90 percent of the city 's homicides are drug-related . Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year . In early 2009 , a 3-year-old girl was killed together with her father inside a vehicle that was targeted , Sandoval said .",What happened to the boy ?,was gunned down across the border in the violent city
861,"LONGYEARBYEN , Norway -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday . The inside of one of the vaults at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean . Dubbed the `` Doomsday Vault , '' the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management . Norwegian musicians performed Tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters -LRB- 427 feet -RRB- inside a frozen mountain . Wangari Maathai , a Kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries . The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . In all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes . The shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major African and Asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to European and South American varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds . Watch as `` Doomsday '' seed vault opens '' Eventually the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the Global Crop Diversity Trust said . The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen , in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole . Building began last year . The United Nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding . `` The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , '' said Cary Fowler , executive director of the trust . `` At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . '' The vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside . `` We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , '' said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten , project manager for the Norwegian government . The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -LRB- 131-yard -RRB- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius -LRB- just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C -LRB- 25 F -RRB- . The vault at Svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in Sussex , England , about an hour outside London . The British vault , called the Millennium Seed Bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops . Paul Smith , the leader of the Millennium Seed Bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops . `` We must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us , '' Smith told CNN . The idea for the Arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources came into force in 2004 , the Norwegian government said . The treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity . Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world . The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner -LRB- $ 9.4 million -RRB- to build the seed vault .

864,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ramping up pressure on Honduras ' interim government , the United States has revoked the visa of the beleaguered country 's leader , a senior Honduran official told CNN en Espanol on Saturday . Roberto Micheletti and his supporters say Honduras underwent a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup . De facto President Roberto Micheletti and 14 supreme court judges had their visas revoked , said Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez . Lopez said he , too , lost his visa privileges . The U.S. State Department recently announced that it would pull the visas of members of Honduras ' de facto regime . In recent weeks , the United States has stepped up its call for the current Honduran government to restore ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power . Zelaya was seized by the Honduran military in his pajamas and sent into exile on June 28 . On Wednesday , the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation , a U.S. government agency , voted to cut $ 11 million in aid to the government in Honduras , senior State Department officials told CNN . Prior to the vote , the board had only suspended the aid , the State Department said . The Millennium Challenge Account is a program started under the Bush administration to reward good governance . The agency 's cuts followed an announcement last week by the United States that it was terminating all nonhumanitarian aid to Honduras to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of an agreement known as the San Jose Accord . The accord calls for Zelaya 's return to power . The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya 's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits . The country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal . Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup . The United Nations has condemned Zelaya 's ouster and does not recognize Michiletti 's government . While the United States has called Zelaya 's ouster a coup , it has not formally designated it a `` military coup , '' which , under U.S. law , would have triggered a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid regardless . Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution . A presidential campaign in Honduras kicked off last week . However , the United States said it would not support the outcome of the elections unless Zelaya was restored to power .

Members of the family believe NATO 's actions led to Gadhafi 's death last week , said Marcel Ceccaldi . `` All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court , '' Ceccaldi , a French attorney , said . NATO responded that it `` conducts its operation in strict conformity with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions . '' In a statement Thursday , a NATO official said , `` At no time during Operation Unified Protector has NATO targeted specific individuals . '' The ICC had previously issued a warrant for Gadhafi 's arrest , accusing him of crimes against humanity . The ICC still has warrants for the arrest of Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . Questions surround the death of Moammar Gadhafi , who eluded forces loyal to the National Transitional Council for months . Video shows Gadhafi was alive when captured by the opposition . He died from a shot in the head , officials said , but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear . The United States said it supports an independent investigation , as called for by the United Nations and by Libya 's new leadership . Ceccaldi said the Gadhafi family 's complaint will be filed in the coming days . `` Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial , '' he added . Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of the NATO military operation , said earlier this week that NATO `` did not get involved in anything beyond what was our legal mandate and we remain well within the mandate assigned to us by the North Atlantic Council . '' While Gadhafi survived an airstrike in the Sirte area shortly before he died , Bouchard said NATO did not know the former Libyan leader was in the convoy . `` We saw a convoy , and in fact we had no idea that Gadhafi was on board , '' Bouchard said . Some vehicles in the convoy were carrying weaponry , and seemed to present a potential threat to the population , he said . The news came as the U.N.

The government of Belize issued a tropical storm warning for the nation 's coast , and the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Catoche south to the border with Belize . A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area -- in this case , within the next six to 12 hours . The storm was forecast to dump up to 10 inches of rain over Belize , up to 15 inches in isolated areas , the hurricane center said . The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season begins Sunday . On Thursday , Tropical Storm Alma , the first one of the year in the eastern Pacific , formed near the west coast of Central America , according to the National Weather Service . The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over the high terrain of Central America . The federal government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted this month that the Atlantic season would be more active than normal , with up to 16 named storms and up to five major hurricanes of Category 3 or above . The noted Colorado State University hurricane forecasting team predicted this year that there would be 15 named storms , eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes . The team calculated a 69 percent chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall on the U.S. coast . A survey released this week found that 50 percent of 1,100 adults surveyed in Atlantic and U.S. Gulf Coast states did not have disaster plans or survival kits . `` Nearly one in three said they would not prepare their home until a storm is within 24 hours of landfall , '' Bill Read , director of the National Hurricane Center , said Thursday . `` Now is the time to buy all that stuff , '' he said upon the release of the survey by polling firm Mason-Dixon .",what will happen if the storm re-emerges into gulf of mexico ?,could re-emerge in the Gulf of Mexico and regain intensity Sunday
871,"-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Women run a lower risk of having babies with certain birth defects if they eat a diet rich in fruits , vegetables , and whole grains during their childbearing years , a new study suggests . Women who followed healthy Mediterranean-style diets in the year before pregnancy were up to one-half as likely as those who ate diets high in meat , fat , and sugar to have a baby with anencephaly , a neural-tube defect that blocks the development of the brain and tends to result in miscarriage . Compared with fat - and sugar-heavy diets , healthier diets -- which included plenty of folate , iron , and calcium -- were also associated with up to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip , a one-quarter lower risk of cleft palate , and a one-fifth lower risk of spina bifida , another neural-tube defect . `` Diet quality matters , and it was protective , '' says Suzan L. Carmichael , Ph.D. , the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine , in Palo Alto , California . Health.com : Feed the Belly : Recipes for a healthy pregnancy The defects covered in the study are very rare overall , occurring in less than 0.1 % of all births . They have become less common since the 1990s , when government health officials led a campaign to increase folic-acid intake among pregnant women through supplements and fortified grain products . Deficiencies in folic acid -- the synthetic form of folate , a B vitamin -- have been linked to both neural-tube defects and cleft lip and palate . Carmichael and her colleagues took into account whether the women in the study were taking folic acid , which suggests that a healthy diet provides protection against birth defects over and above that provided by folic acid . Women of childbearing age should , however , still take folic-acid supplements , says Gail Harrison , Ph.D. , a professor of community health services at the UCLA School of Public Health , in Los Angeles . `` Folic acid has made a difference , '' says Harrison , who was not involved in the study . `` In countries that have used fortification levels higher than the U.S. , it has made an even bigger impact . '' Health.com : How to soothe heartburn during pregnancy Most research on diet and birth defects has focused on single nutrients , such as vitamins A and B12 -LRB- in addition to folate -RRB- . Carmichael and her colleagues took a different approach by looking at overall diet quality -- a method that has become common in cancer and heart-disease research . The government-funded study , which appears this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , compared the diets of 3,824 mothers whose children experienced birth defects with those of 6,807 mothers of healthy children . The researchers collected detailed questionnaires about the women 's diets in the year before they became pregnant , and used that data to score their diet quality on two indexes , one modeled on the U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines and another based on the Mediterranean diet . Both indexes considered fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and `` good '' fats to be healthy , and saturated fats and sweets to be unhealthy . Health.com : Good fats , bad fats : how to choose Across the board , women with the healthiest diets were far less likely to have had children with birth defects than the women with the poorest-quality diets . High scores on both indexes were associated with a reduced risk of defects , although the association was stronger for the USDA score . Seventy-eight percent of the women took supplements containing folic acid during early pregnancy , but higher-quality diets were protective regardless of whether the women took folic acid . The study authors and other experts strongly recommend that pregnant women continue taking folic-acid supplements . But the study does raise the general question of whether `` eating the right foods '' can provide health benefits that supplements do not , says David R. Jacobs Jr. , Ph.D. , a professor of public health at the University of Minnesota , in Minneapolis . Health.com : Diabetes ? 7 tips for a healthy pregnancy `` We have evolved to eat food .

872,"SAN FRANCISCO , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The California Supreme Court has cleared the way for Californians to vote in November on whether to ban same-sex marriages in the state . A gay couple is married in California in June . Voters could void same-sex marriages in the state in November . The court on Wednesday denied a petition to remove the initiative from the state 's general election ballots . The unanimous decision was handed down without elaboration . Hundreds of marriage licenses have been issued to same-sex couples since mid-June , a month after the court overturned the state 's laws against such unions . However , on June 2 , opponents of same-sex marriage filed for a ballot initiative that would ban such marriages in the state 's constitution . Such a ban would overturn the court 's May ruling . Equality California , a Sacramento-based activist group , filed a petition against the initiative -- Proposition 8 -- arguing that it involves a constitutional revision that ca n't be adopted through a ballot vote . The group also contended that petitions circulated to qualify the proposition for the ballot contained material that misled readers about the measure 's effects . Jennifer Kerns , a spokeswoman for the proposition , called Wednesday 's decision `` a huge victory . '' `` We believe it deals a strong blow to our opponents and sends a strong message that they wo n't be able to keep the ballot initiative away from the people of California , '' she said . Calls Wednesday to Equality California were not immediately returned . If the proposition is approved , it would be the second time same-sex marriages have been voided in California . In February 2004 , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom -- who is considering a run for governor -- challenged the state 's laws against same-sex marriage , ordering city officials to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples . Those unions were voided by the California Supreme Court , though the justices sidestepped the issue of whether banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional , allowing legal cases to work their way through the lower courts . Several gay and lesbian couples -- along with the city of San Francisco and gay-rights groups -- sued , saying they were victims of unlawful discrimination . A lower court ruled San Francisco had acted unlawfully in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples . However , the state Supreme Court 's ruling in May struck down the state 's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional . That decision made California the nation 's second state , after Massachusetts , to legalize same-sex marriage . Four other states allow civil unions .",What did the California Supreme Court decide against ?,The California Supreme Court has cleared the way for Californians to vote in November on whether to ban same-sex marriages in the state
873,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six heat-trapping gases that contribute to air pollution pose potential health hazards , the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday in a landmark announcement that could lead to regulation of the gases . `` This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem , '' EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said . The gases -- carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world , the EPA said . The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA 's scientific review in 2007 . `` This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations , '' EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in a release , later adding , `` The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions , and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate . '' The EPA 's finding now goes into a public comment period . The report , titled `` Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality : A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone , '' is the culmination of a study started in 2000 , the EPA said . The White House moved quickly to try to squelch any concerns that the EPA would immediately issue any regulations concerning the gases . `` The president has made clear his strong preference that Congress act to pass comprehensive legislation rather than address the climate challenge through administrative action , '' White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said . `` That 's why the president has repeatedly called for a bill to provide for market-based solutions to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a clean-energy economy that creates millions of green jobs . '' The EPA announcement comes amid efforts by Congress to enact a limit on global warming pollution . The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin hearings next week on a comprehensive energy and climate bill , called the American Clean Energy and Security Act . Committee Chairman Henry Waxman is said to want the bill out of committee by Memorial Day , which falls on May 25 , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants to bring the bill to the House floor for a vote this year . Environmentalists hailed the EPA 's announcement , with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund calling it a `` historic step ... -LSB- that -RSB- formally determined that global warming pollution ` endangers ' the nation 's human health and well-being . '' `` The U.S. is taking its first steps as a nation to confront climate change , '' said Vickie Patton , deputy general counsel at the environmental advocacy group . `` Global warming threatens our health , our economy , and our children 's prosperity . EPA 's action is a wake-up call for national policy solutions that secure our economic and environmental future . '' But critics say the finding will just produce a `` glorious mess . '' `` Today 's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs , raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America 's global competitiveness , '' said Sen. James Inhofe , R-Oklahoma , the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee . `` It now appears EPA 's regulatory reach will find its way into schools , hospitals , assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act . '' The EPA notes in an accompanying report released Friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the United States . Future ozone management decisions may have to take into account the possible effects of global warming , the report says . `` Climate change , along with other aspects of global change , including changes in population , land use and the technologies employed for energy production and transportation , may alter the capacity for U.S. states to successfully attain the national air quality standards in the future , '' the report concludes . Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight causes a chemical reaction in the air between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by motor vehicles and industrial plants . Ozone levels are typically higher on sunny days in areas that have many vehicles or smoke-stack industries . Global warming also could increase the number of days with weather conditions conducive to forming ozone , potentially causing air quality alerts earlier in the spring and later in the fall , the report says . In addition to health problems , the report says global warming could lead to increased drought , more heavy downpours and flooding , and more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires . Global warming could also cause a greater rise in sea level , more intense storms and harm to water resources , agriculture , wildlife and ecosystems , the report said .

874,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Several hundred Sri Lankan Tamil protesters shouted slogans at the British Parliament for a second day Tuesday , urging it to act to end the `` genocide '' against their people in Sri Lanka . Police clash with Tamil protesters outside the Houses of Parliament . `` Stop the genocide ! '' they shouted . `` Stop the war ! '' They waved the red flag of Tamil Eelam , the Tamils ' traditional homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka . The flag is emblazoned with a yellow roaring tiger . Most of the protesters slept overnight on the streets around Parliament Square after beginning their unauthorized protest Monday afternoon . At one point , the protesters blocked the street leading to Westminster Bridge over the River Thames , police said . That led to road closures around Parliament . By Tuesday morning , a solid ring of police had hemmed the protesters in Parliament Square across the street from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben . Roads were open again , but the protest and police presence caused traffic congestion in the area . Hariram Shan , 24 , is a Sri Lankan Tamil who said he has lived in Britain for six years . He said the protesters hope the British government will intervene to stop Sri Lanka 's crackdown on Tamil Tiger rebels , which he said harms civilians . `` They can force economic sanctions , '' Shan told CNN . Dushyanthy Sukumar , 47 , said the Sri Lankan government is retaliating against innocent civilians . `` The Sri Lankan government has now cornered the rebels , the LTTE -LRB- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -RRB- , and what they are doing is killing the people , '' she said . Sukumar , who said she has lived in Britain since leaving her homeland in 1987 , said she is angry at the British government for supporting Sri Lanka . `` The Sri Lankan government is doing their dirty work through this government , '' she said . The Sri Lankan military said Sunday that it had captured the last rebel stronghold and killed five rebel leaders after three days of gunbattles . It said more rebels could still be hiding in a 20-square-kilometer `` safety zone , '' but that it would not enter the area because it is home to some 50,000 people . The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 for an independent homeland for the country 's ethnic Tamil minority .

875,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States , prosecutors said Tuesday . Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson 's fake womb . Gypsy Lawson , 28 , and her mother , Fran Ogren , 56 , were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws . Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok , Thailand , to Los Angeles , California , International Airport , pretending she was pregnant , the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said . Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals . Such permits are granted for research , enhancement and conservation purposes . Additionally , transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration . Lawson and Ogren had neither . `` These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens , as well as the life of the animal in question , '' said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans , said Paul Chang , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent . `` This particular animal tested negative , '' he said . Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates , `` but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat . '' Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter 's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States . The journal also described the pair 's `` acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home , '' McDevitt 's office said . Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant . `` The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt , pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities , '' the statement from McDevitt 's office said . Co-defendant James Edward Pratt , 34 , already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife . He will be sentenced in January . Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3 , 2009 . The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release .

876,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three more members of a polygamous sect led by Warren Jeffs are facing sexual assault charges , Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said Tuesday . The latest charges come two months after Warren Jeffs and five followers were indicted in Texas . On Tuesday , a Texas grand jury indicted the three male members of Jeffs ' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints compound outside Eldorado , Abbott said . Each faces one felony count of sexual assault of a child . Two of them also face felony bigamy charges . The identities of the men were not released because they had not been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon . In July , the Schleicher County grand jury indicted Jeffs and four of his Texas FLDS followers on child sexual assault charges . Jeffs was charged with sexually assaulting a child under 17 . A fifth follower was charged with failure to report child abuse . The charges stem from a state and federal investigation into the sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch . In April , child welfare workers removed more than 400 children from the compound , citing allegations of physical and sexual abuse . After a court battle , the Texas Supreme Court ordered the children returned in June , saying that the state had no right to remove them and that there was no evidence to show the children faced imminent danger of abuse on the ranch . Jeffs , 52 , is the leader and `` prophet '' of the estimated 10,000-member FLDS , an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church . The FLDS openly practices polygamy at the YFZ Ranch and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line : Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona . Jeffs , who is facing a sentence in Utah of up to life in prison and is awaiting trial in Arizona , could face another life sentence in Texas if convicted on the latest charge . In Utah , he was convicted on accomplice to rape charges for his role in the marriage of a sect member to a 14-year-old . He faces similar charges in Arizona . His attorney in Arizona , Michael Piccarreta , has questioned the motives of Texas authorities . He said in July that the state 's investigation into Jeffs and his followers is an effort `` to cover themselves up on the botched attack on the ranch in Texas .

877,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States imposed stiff sanctions against Iran on Thursday , targeting two Iranian military groups and a number of Iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities . `` What this means is that no U.S. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities , '' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said . `` In addition , any assets that these designees have under U.S. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen . '' Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on Thursday morning . Rice accused Iran of `` pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon ; building dangerous ballistic missiles ; supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories ; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations , threatening to wipe Israel off the map . '' Watch Rice tell why sanctions are being imposed '' `` Many of the Iranian regime 's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies : the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or the IRGC , and the Quds force , an arm of the IRGC , '' she said . She said the sanctions were being imposed `` because of the Revolutionary Guard 's support for proliferation and the Quds force support for terrorism . '' The United States also designated three Iranian state-owned banks for sanctions , two of them `` for their involvement in proliferation activities '' and the other `` as a terrorist financier , '' Rice said . `` Iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists , '' Paulson said . `` Iran 's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls . '' The Revolutionary Guard Corps , he said , `` is so deeply entrenched in Iran 's economy and commercial enterprises , it is increasingly likely that , if you are doing business with Iran , you are doing business '' with the corps . `` We call on responsible banks and companies around the world to terminate any business with Bank Melli , Bank Mellat , Bank Saderat , and all companies and entities '' of the corps , Paulson said . The move marks the first time the United States has attempted to punish another country 's military through sanctions . Previous sanctions imposed by the United States have been tied to Iran 's nuclear program . The United States has been working with other world powers to halt what they believe is Iran 's intent to develop a nuclear arsenal . Iran says it is pursuing nuclear power for peaceful reasons . Mohamed ElBaradei , director-general of the United Nations ' International Atomic Energy Agency , said last month that Iran 's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful use and criticized U.S. rhetoric regarding Iran . The Quds Force is blamed by the U.S. military for training and arming Shiite militias in Iraq and smuggling highly lethal explosives into Iraq , where they are used to attack coalition forces . Iran denies the charge . `` If the Iranian government fulfills its international obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activity , I will join my British , French , Russian , Chinese and German colleagues , and I will meet with my Iranian counterpart any time , anywhere , '' Rice said . `` We will be open to the discussion of any issue . But if Iran 's rulers choose to continue down a path of confrontation , the United States will act with the international community to resist these threats of the Iranian regime . '' Last month , representatives of world powers announced that unless a November report shows a `` positive outcome '' of talks with Iran about its uranium enrichment program , they will move ahead with plans for a resolution imposing additional sanctions on the country . The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly demanded that Iran suspend enrichment of uranium and has imposed limited sanctions on Tehran for refusing to comply .

879,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Homegrown terrorism will be part of the United States ' National Security Strategy for the first time , according to President Barack Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , who called it a new phase of the terrorist threat . When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy on Thursday , it will be the first time any president `` explicitly recognizes the threat to the United States posed by individuals radicalized here at home , '' National Security Adviser John Brennan said Wednesday . The strategy acts as a blueprint for how a White House administration intends to protect Americans . In the past , it has focused mostly on international threats . But a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document , Brennan said . Earlier this month , Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York 's bustling district of Times Square . U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November . Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi , an Afghan national , pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system . And David Headley , an American citizen from Chicago , Illinois , is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai , India , terrorist attacks that killed 160 people . `` We 've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes , '' Brennan said . `` We have seen individuals , including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports , travel easily to extremist safe havens , return to America , their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement . '' Brennan , who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11 , al Qaeda has shown itself to be a `` resilient , resourceful and determined enemy . '' Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training , attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks . `` They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense , '' Brennan said . `` As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics , so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours . '' Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president 's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates , but said it `` will require a broad , sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power , military and civilian , kinetic and diplomatic .

A law that went into effect January 1 in California makes it illegal to send text messages while driving . Sens. Chuck Schumer , D-New York ; Robert Menendez , D-New Jersey ; Mary Landrieu , D-Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan , D-North Carolina , unveiled the ALERT Act , which would ban truck and car drivers and operators of mass transit from texting while driving . The proposed legislation would prohibit any driver from sending text or e-mail messages while driving a vehicle , said an earlier news release from the senators . If the bill passes , the Department of Transportation would set the minimum standards for compliance . States that do not enact text-banning laws within two years of the bill 's passage could lose 25 percent of their federal highway funds , Schumer said in a news conference announcing the legislation . The noncompliant states could recuperate that money once they meet the text-banning standards , Schumer said . CTIA , a cellular phone industry group , said that it supports legislation that addresses text messaging while driving . `` CTIA and our member companies continue to believe text messaging while driving is incompatible with safe driving , '' said a statement on CTIA 's Web site . Fourteen states , including the home states of three of the bill 's sponsors , and the District of Columbia already have laws barring texting while driving : Alaska , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Louisiana , Maryland , Minnesota , New Jersey , North Carolina , Tennessee , Utah , Virginia and Washington .

The senators cited a Virginia Tech Transportation Institute study that found that truck drivers who texted while driving were 23 times more likely to crash or get into a near-accident than undistracted drivers . Watch more on the dangers of driving and texting When compared with dialing , talking , listening or reaching for an electronic device , texting posed the greatest accident risk , the study found .

881,"ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistan 's military continued its assault Thursday on militants in Taliban-held areas , its chief spokesman told reporters . Pakistani army trucks move military equipment into the troubled Buner district Thursday . So far , 14 militants have been killed in the past 24 hours , Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said . The operation is still ongoing in the districts of Dir and Buner , which was recently seized by the Taliban in violation of an agreement with Pakistan 's government . Pakistani forces have completely secured Daggar , the main town in Buner and the scene of heavy fighting on Wednesday , Abbas said . The Daggar operation resulted in the deaths of 50 militants , but freed 18 Frontier Corps personnel who had been abducted by militants , he said . Fifty-two of their colleagues are still believed to be held by their suspected Taliban kidnappers . This week 's military operation has resulted in more than 180 militant casualties since Sunday , while the military has suffered one death and one injury , according to Abbas . He said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week . Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night vision technology , Abbas said Thursday . Most of this week 's casualties happened on Tuesday , when Pakistani fighter jets launched airstrikes , killing at least 70 militants in the Dir district , according to the Pakistani military . The operation is part of the Pakistani army 's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions . The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan . As a result , the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan , which have rankled relations between the two countries . The military campaign has apparently not stopped Washington from carrying out unmanned drone attacks on Pakistan 's soil . A suspected unmanned aerial vehicle killed six people Wednesday night in the village of Kaniguran in the tribal district of South Waziristan near the border with Afghanistan , Pakistani intelligence sources said . Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are American airstrikes on its territory . The U.S. military in Afghanistan has not commented on the strikes , which typically target Taliban fighters in the border region . But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled drones . U.S. President Barack Obama is `` gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan , '' he told reporters Wednesday night . Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . '' But he stressed he was more concerned about the ability of Pakistan 's civilian government to `` deliver basic services , '' and not `` that they 're immediately going to be overrun '' by the Taliban . Pakistan 's recent military crackdown has led to an exodus of civilians from the region . At least 33,000 residents have left their homes in the midst of the recent fighting , according to Amnesty International . Civilians fleeing from Lower Dir in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province join more than 500,000 people already displaced by the fighting , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said . The Pakistani military completed its operation to eliminate and expel militants in Dir Tuesday , and is now focusing on the Buner district , Abbas said . About 300 militants entered Buner a few days ago , in violation of the Taliban 's recent agreement to leave the district , he said . Buner is about 60 miles from Islamabad , but Abbas said the militants pose no threat of entering the capital . The fighter jets pounded targets in Buner and the Swat Valley in an effort to block the militants ' entry and exit points , according to Abbas .

Khosrat Rasul , the vice president of the Kurdistan Regional Government , resigned , along with four other members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan -LRB- PUK -RRB- , according to Kurdish lawmakers . Rasul is a battle-scarred veteran of Kurdish rebellions against former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Kurdish members of the Iraqi Parliament say the resignations threaten the delicate balance of power in Iraqi Kurdistan , a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq . It has been the most stable part of the country since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion . `` It looks very serious , '' said Ala Talabani , the president 's niece and a PUK member , as well as a member of Parliament . She spoke by phone from the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya , long a stronghold of the PUK . '' It 's about corruption , '' Ala Talabani said of the resignations . `` They are asking about the resources and the money . Who is spending it . And who is in charge of the income of the party . '' `` It 's not good , '' said Mahmoud Othman , a member of the Iraqi Parliament and an independent Kurdish politician . `` The PUK is one of the main two -LSB- Kurdish -RSB- players , '' he added . `` A problem like this will upset the whole situation . '' Iraqi Kurdistan broke free from Baghdad 's control after the 1991 Gulf War . Since then , the region has been divided between two rival Kurdish factions , Talabani 's PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party , led by Massoud Barzani . For several years throughout the 1990s , the groups battled each other in the mountains and valleys of northern Iraq . Those historic divisions faded somewhat following the United States ' overthrow of Hussein . For the past five years , the Kurds have worked together in Baghdad to enhance the Kurdish region 's position in Iraq . Kurdish politicians deftly took advantage of divisions between Sunni and Shi'a Arab factions . They successfully lobbied to maintain Kurdistan 's militia of pesh merga fighters . Demands to expand the Kurdish zone of control and win the right to exploit oil deposits in Kurdish territory have increased tensions between Kurdish and Arab politicians . The resignation of Rasul and his allies threatens the power base of Talabani , the first Kurdish president in Iraqi history . `` If it is not fixed by Talabani by tomorrow , this could change the entire landscape of Kurdish politics , '' said Hiwa Osman , the Iraq country director of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting . Iraq 's three northern Kurdish provinces are scheduled to hold regional elections in May . Talabani is expected to travel to Kurdistan to hold emergency meetings with Rasul and his other former comrades-in-arms . This is not the first time the stout Kurdish leader has faced a rebellion from within the ranks of his followers . Kurdish observers say these disputes usually stem from disagreements over money and power .",What are resignations over ?,"It 's about corruption , '' Ala Talabani said of the"
883,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Briton accused of hacking into U.S. government computers on Friday lost his court appeal to have his case heard in Britain , his legal team said . Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation . The decision means Gary McKinnon faces extradition to the United States , where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into computers at the Pentagon and NASA . His mother , Janis Sharp , promised to appeal . McKinnon , who has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to computer systems , wanted to be tried in Britain rather than the United States . He planned to ask judges at the High Court in London to review a recent decision by the director of public prosecutions not to pursue legal action in Britain , a spokeswoman at the prosecutor 's office told CNN July . The prosecutor 's decision effectively cleared the way for McKinnon 's extradition . The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time , accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001 and costing the government about $ 1 million . McKinnon , currently free on bail in England , has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs . Prosecutors in the United States and Britain disagree . `` These were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach U.S. defense systems at a critical time which caused well-documented damage , '' Alison Saunders of the Crown Prosecution Service said in February . `` They may have been conducted from Mr. McKinnon 's home computer -- and in that sense there is a UK link -- but the target and the damage were trans-Atlantic .

884,"LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British man Gary McKinnon appeared in court Tuesday to try to prevent his extradition to the United States , where he is wanted for allegedly hacking into U.S. government computers at the Pentagon and NASA . Briton Gary McKinnon is accused of carrying out the biggest ever U.S. military hacking operation .

It is not clear when the judges will make a decision on McKinnon 's request . Prosecutors made their decision in February despite saying there was sufficient evidence to prosecute McKinnon .

885,"Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Latino voters strongly support President Barack Obama and his Democratic Party , despite dissatisfaction with the administration 's deportation policies , according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center . The results are good news for Obama and Democrats for next year 's election , as Hispanics are the fastest-growing population group in the country and comprise a major voting bloc . According to the survey , Latino registered voters favor Obama over Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney or Texas Gov. Rick Perry by margin of more than 2-to-1 . The results are similar to the presidential election in 2008 , when Obama got 67 % of the Latino vote compared with 31 % for Republican candidate Sen. John McCain . Hispanic voters have traditionally identified with the Democratic Party , and the Pew survey 's results showed that connection continues . It said two-thirds of Hispanic registered voters identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party , while 20 % felt that way about the Republican Party . `` It is interesting that among Latino voters , the voters who are registered , there is a lot of support for the Democrats , but also for Barack Obama , '' Mark Hugo Lopez , executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center , said in an interview with CNN . The survey of 1,200 Hispanic adults was conducted in English and Spanish from November 9 through December 7 , and has a margin of error of 3.6 % . While showing strong Latino support for Obama and Democrats , the survey also showed Hispanics dislike immigration policies of the Obama administration , which increased deportations to 395,000 in 2009 and 387,000 in 2010 . According to the Pew survey , 59 % of Latino respondents disapproved of the administration 's handling of deportations , while 27 % approved . At the same time , the survey found that less than half of the Hispanic respondents -- 41 % -- knew that more deportations were occurring under the Obama administration than the Bush administration that preceded it . A strong majority -- 77 % -- of Latino respondents who were aware of the increased deportations under Obama disapproved of his administration 's policy , while just over half of those unaware of the increase also expressed disapproval . Hispanics accounted for 97 % of deportees in 2010 , according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . More than 90 % of Latino respondents in the survey support the DREAM Act , a Democratic measure pushed by Obama that provides a pathway to legal residency for children of illegal immigrants who attend college or serve in the military . Republicans have blocked passage of the measure in Congress . In the interview with CNN , the Pew Hispanic Center 's Lopez said that the most important issues for Hispanic registered voters were jobs , education and health care -- the same as in past years .

886,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wayne Rooney insists he will be fit to lead England 's charge for the World Cup after injury curtailed the Manchester United striker 's English Premier League season . The 24-year-old is currently sidelined with a groin injury but after picking up the Premier League 's player of the year award -- voted for by his fellow professionals -- he said there is no way he will miss out on the tournament in South Africa . Rooney has been in lethal goalscoring form this season , netting 40 goals for club and country , and has been pinpointed as the key player in England 's bid to lift the World Cup for only the second time in their history . `` The groin will be fine for the World Cup , there are no worries about that , '' he told the Professional Footballers ' Association awards in London . `` I 'm hoping to play for United in the last game of the season . '' It is the first time Rooney has won the PFA award , though he has twice scooped the young player of the year award . He said : `` I remember coming here in 2005 and 2006 to win the young player of the year award . I saw the players winning the main one and it 's something I 've aimed for since . '' Rooney paid tribute to his club manager , Alex Ferguson , who insists he has no plans to retire from the game , at 68 . `` Sir Alex is a great manager who has really brought me on as a player since I joined United , Rooney said . `` His hunger passes through to the players . `` It 's great to see that he 's pushing 70 and he has n't changed a bit . I 'm sure he 'll be at United a long time yet . '' Rooney is hoping Manchester United can secure a fourth straight Premier League crown , but they remain one point behind Chelsea after Carlo Ancelotti 's side thrashed Stoke 7-0 on Sunday . Chelsea travel to Liverpool next weekend in a game that could have a huge bearing on the destination of the title and Rooney is confident the Reds can do his side a favor . `` I 'm sure Liverpool will want to beat Chelsea , '' said Rooney . `` The pride they 've got and the history they 've got , I 'm sure they 'll want to win that game . They are fighting to get into the Europa League .

887,"Editor 's note : Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health . Dr. Anthony S. Fauci : Progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS , but `` our work is just beginning . '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When we commemorated the first World AIDS Day on December 1 , 1988 , we had little to celebrate . The number of reported AIDS cases in the United States was nearing 80,000 and rising rapidly . Untold thousands more in this country were living with the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV . Globally , AIDS cases already had been reported from more than 135 countries . An AIDS tsunami clearly was looming , but we had few defenses at our disposal . For those of us caring for people with AIDS , it was a dark time . We had just one anti-HIV medicine in our pharmacies , AZT , a drug that the virus rapidly defeated by mutating and developing resistance . Lacking other medicines to slow the relentless replication of HIV and its destruction of a person 's immune system , we did our best to help our patients by managing to the extent possible their AIDS-related infections and complications . But the life span of most of the patients was measured in months . Two decades later , much has changed . An unprecedented research effort has led to more than two dozen anti-HIV drugs , more than for all other viral diseases combined . Taken in proper combinations , these medications have dramatically improved the prognosis for people living with HIV by increasing their life span by at least a decade and providing the possibility of a normal life span with continued therapy . Scientifically proven prevention approaches -- education and outreach to at-risk populations , voluntary HIV testing and counseling , condom distribution , prevention of HIV transmission from mother to baby , harm reduction approaches for drug abusers , mass-media campaigns and the screening of donated blood -- have been deployed with great success in the United States and many other countries . Innovative programs such as the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , as well as the efforts of nongovernment organizations , have reached millions of people in low - and mid-income countries worldwide with HIV-related services , at a scale unimaginable a few years ago . And gradually -- but too slowly -- we have begun addressing AIDS-related stigma in this country and abroad . Much has been accomplished in the fight against HIV/AIDS from scientific , medical and public health standpoints . However , now is no time to rest on our accomplishments or our laurels . The statistics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic tell us that much more needs to be done . Around the world , a staggering 2.7 million people were infected in 2007 alone . Globally , 33 million people are living with HIV infection , most of them in the developing world . In the United States , more than 1 million people are living with HIV . And 56,000 more people are infected each year in the U.S. , driving HIV prevalence rates in some of our communities to levels that rival those seen in sub-Saharan Africa . Gay and bisexual men , and African-Americans in general , are disproportionately affected . The true ground zero of the HIV epidemic in the United States is in those communities . What is the way forward ? First , even in the face of a world economic crisis , the global community must scale up the delivery of proven HIV therapies and prevention services . In low - and middle-income countries , less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it , and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services . All around the world , access to HIV services -- and medical care in general -- remains a challenge in many poor communities . The global community must sustain our commitment to investing resources for medicines , clinics , as well as training and salaries for doctors , nurses and community health care workers to provide care for HIV/AIDS and other diseases in the settings where they occur . Here in the United States , more than one-fifth of people living with HIV are unaware of their infection and not receiving appropriate care for their own health or the prevention services that would help them avoid transmitting the virus to others . A frequent scenario is that people learn of their infection status only when they have advanced symptoms of HIV disease , when their health may by irreparably damaged . Now is the time for the medical community and policymakers to embrace U.S. guidelines for all Americans aged 13-64 to be voluntarily tested in routine medical care . Barriers to implementation of HIV testing guidelines , such as state , local or agency regulations that conflict with the recommendations , variability in payment coverage for the test , and concerns about the stigma and discrimination that may accompany an HIV diagnosis , must be addressed . Meanwhile , we also must continue to invest in the next generation of treatment and prevention modalities . Encouragingly , new means of preventing HIV infection are emerging from well-designed and well-implemented clinical research trials . One exciting concept is pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP , giving preventive doses of anti-HIV drugs to individuals who are at an increased risk of HIV infection . This still-experimental strategy is based on the concept that if HIV replication can be inhibited immediately following exposure to the virus , permanent infection might be thwarted . Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world . Ongoing research to develop microbicidal gels or creams to be applied before sex offer the hope of people being able to protect themselves from HIV infection in situations where saying no to sex or insisting on condom use is not an option . Finally , a preventive HIV vaccine remains the greatest hope for halting the relentless spread of HIV/AIDS . We must solve the mystery of how to prompt the human body to produce a protective immune response against HIV , which natural infection with the virus seems unable to do . Historically , it has taken decades to find effective vaccines to combat most infectious diseases . Researchers usually experienced numerous setbacks and disappointments before reaching success , yet they persevered . Finding a safe and effective HIV vaccine demands an equally intense resolve . On this World AIDS Day , we should be proud of the many scientific advances that have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS . But it is hardly a time for self-congratulation . Rather , we must understand that our work is just beginning . Developing HIV interventions and delivering them to the people who need them will require scientific and public health vision , and dedication from all sectors of society , in good times and bad . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci .",What is a challenge in poor areas ?,access to HIV services -- and medical care in general
889,"JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indonesia is no stranger to bombings such as the one that rocked two luxury hotels in Jakarta on Friday . Indonesian counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta . As authorities sift through the rubble of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels , which were struck by bombs that killed at least eight people , some could not help but think about past bombings in the Southeast Asian country . In 2002 , a bombing at two night clubs on the island of Bali killed 202 people , mostly foreign tourists . More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta . Dozens of victims were burned beyond recognition or blown to pieces . The bombing was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah -- a terror group with ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda terrorist network . The group is suspected in other bombings . Many of those convicted in the plot were sentenced to death or life in prison . In August 2003 , the same JW Marriott Hotel that was attacked Friday was bombed , killing 12 . The Australian Embassy in Jakarta was targeted in 2004 . A powerful car bomb shook Jakarta 's central business district , blowing a hole through the embassy 's security gate , killing at least eight people and wounding about 168 . A year later , three suicide bombers targeted two tourist spots on the resort island of Bali . The bombings -- two at the cafes near Jimbaran Beach and one at a restaurant in Kuta 's main square -- killed 19 people and wounded at least 132 , according to hospital officials . Despite the string of bombings , presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal said Indonesia has made strides in addressing terrorist groups . Watch an eyewitness report of the blasts '' `` We have made significant progress in curbing the activities of terrorists , '' the spokesman said . Watch a report on suspects behind the blasts '' `` In recent years , we have several preventative successes in arresting terrorist cells just before they were able to make their attacks .

890,"If you want to know where American food traditions are headed , look back . Many of today 's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday 's : Nearby farms offering nutritious , peak-of-season produce ; slow-cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals ; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods . Sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , the USDA says . `` It used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage . But today , food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest , most natural way possible , '' says Fern Gale Estrow , M.S. , R.D. , a community nutritionist based in New York City . `` People still want and need to save time in the kitchen , but they 're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it . '' Fortunately , these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful , nutrient-rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements . Flexitarianism Like vegetarians , `` flexitarians '' eat a primarily plant-based diet composed of grains , vegetables , and fruits , but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat , fish , poultry , or dairy . A quarter of Americans fit the description , consuming meatless meals at least four days a week , according to the American Dietetic Association . Why it 's here to stay : Flexitarianism is exactly what dietitians , nutritional researchers , and public health advocates have been recommending for years . `` It 's about eating a varied diet that 's low in saturated fat and high in fiber , '' says Milton Stokes , M.P.H. , R.D. , chief dietitian at St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City , and an ADA spokesperson . Because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein , flexitarians are more likely than most Americans to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain . CookingLight.com : Take our quiz on correct serving sizes What it means for you : Studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension , heart disease , diabetes , and prostate and colon cancer . In one large study from Tulane University in New Orleans , Louisiana , researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19-year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent , and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent . Locally grown foods As people seek fresher foods , they have begun to connect with local family farms . Community-supported agriculture -LRB- CSA -RRB- programs and farmers ' markets give consumers direct access to produce , meats , cheeses , breads , honey , and other foods that are produced in nearby communities . In the past 10 years , the number of local farmers ' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Marketing Service . Why it 's here to stay : Because they are so fresh , locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on `` factory '' farms . The latter , which constitutes most of the produce grown in the United States , is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves , and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it 's sold , according to Local Harvest , a nonprofit agricultural research group . All that downtime takes a toll . USDA researchers have found that if it 's not handled properly , produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit . Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C are particularly vulnerable . What it means for you : `` Buying food from local vendors gives you input , '' says Gail Feenstra , R.D. , food systems analyst at the University of California at Davis ' Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program . `` You can find out how things were grown . You can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that would n't be available elsewhere . '' And then there 's the most important reason of all : Because of its freshness , locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped . `` Growers ' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation , '' Feenstra says . Functional foods Functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food . Familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins A and D . As sales of these foods have soared in recent years , more functional foods have reached the market , such as eggs and pastas with omega-3 fatty acids , sterol-fortified chocolates and high-fiber , high-protein flours . Why it 's here to stay : These foods help many people fill nutritional gaps . `` For example , if you 're lactose intolerant , you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota , '' Stokes says . `` Calcium-fortified juice eliminates that problem , especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet . '' Likewise , if you dislike seafood , you can obtain extra omega-3s from eggs or pasta . CookingLight.com : Remembering real portion sizes What it means for you : Functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet , not a substitute for it . `` Calcium-fortified orange juice wo n't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide , like protein , '' Estrow says . `` That 's why it 's best to rely on whole foods , which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically . '' In the end , it 's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food , but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources . Organic food These are foods produced following a government-regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides , herbicides , and other chemicals used in traditional farming . Organic food is one of the country 's fastest-growing market segments ; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , according to the USDA 's Economic Research Service . Why it 's here to stay : Some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost . A research review of 41 studies conducted by the University of California at Davis found that , on average , organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin C , 21 percent more iron , and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods . The kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category 's growth , such as cookies , baked goods , and boxed meals , also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness . What it means for you : `` An organic stamp is n't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality , but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated , '' Stokes says . An organic cookie , for example , may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie . But in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides , such as peaches , apples , and strawberries , choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals , according to tests conducted by researchers from the Environmental Working Group in Washington , D.C. CookingLight.com : All-star foods that fight for health Slow food Launched in Italy 20 years ago by restaurateur Carlo Petrini , `` slow food '' was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle . The trend 's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items , preparing them in traditional ways , and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast-paced , eat-on-the-run lives many people lead . Why it 's here to stay : As with locally grown food , freshness is a key component of the slow food trend . `` Investing the time to choose what 's fresh that day will ensure that night 's meal will be at its peak nutritionally , '' Stokes says . This principle applies whether you 're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability . Family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend . `` Slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be : a vehicle for drawing people together , '' explains Sara Firebaugh , assistant director of Slow Food USA . What it means for you : Healthful whole foods are a great start , but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it 's a difficult one to quantify . No scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions , but the benefits are clear . `` Slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices , meal preparation , and the act of eating , '' Estrow says . `` A healthful diet is n't just about what you eat but how you eat it .

892,"WHITE OAK , Maryland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seeking to remove unapproved drugs from the marketplace , the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered nine companies to stop manufacturing narcotics whose therapeutic claims have not been proved . The FDA ordered nine companies to stop selling unapproved drugs marketed for pain relief . The FDA 's warning letters notified the companies they may be subject to legal action if they do not stop manufacturing and distributing `` prescription unapproved products '' that include high-concentrate morphine sulfate oral solutions and immediate-release tablets containing morphine sulfate , hydromorphone or oxycodone . This action does not include oxycodone capsules . All of these drugs are used for pain relief and are forms of previously approved medications . The agency says this is not a recall , but is instead a warning to manufacturers . The companies have 60 days to pull these pain-relief drugs from the market . Distributors have 90 days to stop shipping them . If these drugs are not off the market by those deadlines , a company could face seizure of the narcotics and legal action . `` We estimate there are several hundred unapproved drugs out there , '' said Deborah Autor , director of the office of compliance within the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research . `` We will continue to take aggressive action against those firms that do not have the required FDA approval for their drugs . Today 's warning letters are another demonstration of our commitment to remove illegal , unproved drugs from the market . '' Although the FDA does not know whether these drugs are unsafe , it has not approved them so can not certify that the products are 100 percent safe and effective . `` Consumers have a right to expect that their drugs meet the FDA 's safety and effectiveness standards , '' said Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research . `` Doctors and patients are often unaware that not all drugs on the market are backed by FDA approval . It is a high priority for the FDA to remove these products from the market because they may be unsafe , ineffective , inappropriately labeled , or of poor quality . '' The FDA believes Americans have access to plenty of legal narcotics for pain relief and removing these unapproved drugs will not create a shortage . Consumers who may be concerned that they are taking any unapproved drug products should refer to the FDA 's Unapproved Drugs Web page , which includes a list of manufacturers of these products . Those who find they are taking unapproved drugs should see their health care professionals for treatment options .

893,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera , a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means `` Shorty , '' is the most wanted man in Mexico . He 's also one of the most wanted men in the United States . Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel , which is battling for turf along the border . For five years , the State Department has kept a $ 5 million bounty on his head , calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security . Guzman , who leads the Sinaloa cartel , is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border . He recently upped the stakes , ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors , according to the Los Angeles Times . The cartel 's tentacles and those of its chief rival , the Gulf cartel , already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta , Georgia ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March . `` No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does , '' said Arabit , who heads the DEA 's office in this year 's border hot spot , El Paso , Texas . See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. . A December 2008 report by the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities . So far , the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico , where the cartels ' running gunbattles with police , the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year . It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007 . Once again , drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year , Arabit said . See who the key players are '' The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker , DEA agents say . But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire . `` It 's coming . I guarantee , it 's coming , '' said Michael Sanders , a DEA spokesman in Washington . Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman 's shoot-to-kill instructions are n't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals ; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials , the Los Angeles Times reported , citing sources and intelligence memos . The move is seen as dangerously brazen , the newspaper reported . In the past , the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement . U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border . The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $ 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border . But $ 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target . Guzman , who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel , is said to be worth $ 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade . He made this year 's Forbes list of the richest of the rich , landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell 's Soup fortune . Popular Mexican songs , called narcocorridos , embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader . `` Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico , '' said security consultant Scott Stewart , invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993 . Stewart , a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor , a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman 's worth . Just a decade ago , Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians , moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean . But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels . The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back . Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits . Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States , according to the DEA . Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine . Marijuana became the cartels ' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007 , bringing in $ 8.5 billion . Cocaine came in second , at $ 3.9 billion , and methamphetamine earned $ 1 billion , a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year . Watch how marijuana became the cartels ' top cash crop '' The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels , but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border , according to the DEA agents , local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN . The cartels ' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa , Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence . The status and alliances of the players continue to shift . Although the DEA and some analysts disagree , others say the Zetas , a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police , are now running the Gulf cartel . `` From what we 've seen , the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel , '' analyst Stewart said . `` In violent times , soldiers tend to rise to the top . '' These soldiers are incredibly well-armed , police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime `` Hummer '' Gonzalez Duran . It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles , including AK-47s ; 287 grenades ; two rocket launchers ; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition . At the very least , the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table . The DEA 's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate . Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , a former military man who is also known as `` El Lazco , '' or `` The Executioner . '' The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border 's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors . The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas ; Sonora Nogales , across from Nogales , Arizona ; and Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , California . Two years ago , the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo , across the border from Laredo , Texas . It 's all about the highways that help move the drugs . Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor , and Juarez has easy access to I-10 , a major east-west interstate , and I-25 , which runs north to Denver , Colorado . Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5 , which heads north all the way to the Canadian border . Some of the battles are internal , Arabit said . Some are with other cartels . And some , he said , can be attributed to the cartels ' `` desperate '' attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers . As soon as he took office in January 2007 , Calderon called out the cartels . He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and , in some cases , do the job of local police . Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office . The violence involves beheadings , running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches . Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight . The cartels ' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets . `` The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq , '' analyst Stewart said . `` It was simple machismo . The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas . '' When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s , the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant , beneficiaries of their location . Today , they are shadows of their former selves , weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders . Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997 . Known as `` The King of the Skies '' for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes , he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest . Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery . Two of them later were killed . His death , along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen , set the stage for the ongoing turf battle . When Cardenas was extradited in 2007 , Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales . Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston , Texas , where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros , Mexico . Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana , and last year , Guzman made a move on that plaza as well . `` Right now , they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar , '' said the DEA 's Elizabeth Kempshall , who heads the agency 's office in Phoenix , Arizona . Phoenix has become the nation 's kidnapping capital , largely because of the cartels ' increasing presence . Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition : `` That is the worst thing for any cartel leader , to face justice in the United States . '' CNN 's Eliott C.

894,"NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A lawsuit filed January 30 by baseball great Roberto Alomar 's ex-girlfriend alleges he engaged in unprotected sex with her while suffering from HIV/AIDS . Roberto Alomar 's ex-girlfriend says he had unprotected sex with her while infected with HIV . Ilya Dall is asking for $ 15 million for `` personal injuries '' suffered due to Alomar 's negligence . She and her two children lived with the former New York Mets slugger for three years . She alleges that he started exhibiting signs of HIV as early as 2005 , but twice refused recommendations for an HIV test by his doctor , saying that earlier tests for the disease had come back negative , according to court papers . Alomar 's lawyer , Charles Bach , was not available for comment , but attorney Luke Pittoni , who also represents Alomar , said , `` We believe this is a totally frivolous lawsuit -- these allegations are baseless , he 's healthy and he 'd like to keep his health status private . We 'll do our talking in court . '' Anthony Piancentini , who is representing Dall , said he has `` no comment '' at this time . Dall says in court papers that Alomar told her `` I do n't have HIV . '' She alleges he `` lied and purposefully misrepresented his physical condition '' and `` that he was endangering the health and well being of -LSB- Dall -RSB- by continuing to have unprotected sexual relations with -LSB- her -RSB- , '' according to the lawsuit . Court papers list several physical ailments that Dall says Alomar exhibited from early 2005 on , including white spots on his mouth and throat , extreme fatigue , back and vision problems , and shingles . In early 2006 , Alomar submitted to an HIV test that , according to court papers , confirmed he was HIV positive in February 2006 . Dall says she went for an HIV test shortly afterward and the results were negative . The couple visited a disease specialist shortly after Alomar 's diagnosis , who found a mass in Alomar 's chest and advised the couple that he was suffering from full-blown AIDS , according to the lawsuit . Dall alleges that a few days later , Alomar 's skin was turning purple and he was foaming at the mouth ; a spinal tap on February 21 , 2006 , confirmed he had full-blown AIDS , court papers said . Dall claims in the lawsuit that Alomar 's negligence caused her severe `` emotional distress '' over the health of her children . Court papers say that because the couple lived with the children , they may have been exposed to Alomar 's saliva or blood in the bathroom , through things like toothbrushes and other items . Dall claims to suffer from `` permanent emotional distress '' even after repeatedly testing negative for HIV . The lawsuit claims her fear of contracting the disease is known as `` AIDS phobia '' and that she suffers from permanent post-traumatic stress disorder . Alomar requested Tuesday that the suit be moved to Brooklyn , New York , federal court . It was originally filed in Supreme Court in Queens , New York . An initial conference on the case is expected on April 15 in Brooklyn federal court . Alomar is the son and brother of major leaguers -- father Sandy Alomar was a second baseman with several teams between 1964 and 1978 and brother Sandy Alomar Jr. is a former catcher who played from 1988 to 2007 . Roberto Alomar retired in 2004 with a .300 lifetime batting average , 12 All-Star game selections and 10 Gold Gloves . He was the All Star Game MVP in 1998 and played on two Toronto Blue Jays World Series champion teams . Alomar , then playing for the Baltimore Orioles , is also known for an incident in 1996 during a game against the Blue Jays when he spat in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck following a heated argument over a third strike . After the incident , Alomar claimed the umpire uttered a slur to him during the argument .",What did the woman say that Alomar did ?,he had unprotected sex with her while infected with HIV

Shiite Muslim women light candles early Friday at a shrine in the holy city of Karbala , Iraq . The first four attacks , which together killed 36 and wounded 124 , targeted Shiites ; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target . In the latest attack , a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad . Six people died , and 30 were wounded , the official said . The attack appeared to have targeted a police patrol ; three of the fatalities were police , the official said . But most of the carnage was directed at Shiite targets , with the highest single toll exacted in the northern city of Mosul , where a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque as a funeral was taking place , killing 30 people and wounding 100 , the official said . In another attack , a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying pilgrims in the Sadr City neighborhood , killing three and wounding eight , the official said . Also in Sadr City , a roadside bomb exploded near a car , killing one person and wounding seven . And in eastern Baghdad , a car carrying pilgrims was targeted , killing two people and wounding nine . Friday was the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration in Karbala celebrating the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi , the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites . Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims . According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam , Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi `` is expected to return at the end of time as the messianic imam who will restore justice and equity on Earth . '' Last Friday , bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously , killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques . The attacks fueled fears that sectarian violence could be reigniting in the country and called into question the ability of security forces to safeguard the population as U.S. troops have taken a back seat to their Iraqi counterparts . Though the number of casualties has dropped over the past year , Friday 's attacks show that an insurgency capable of wreaking havoc remains .

897,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia 's hard-line Islamic group Al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar , the president 's hometown , after a battle with pro-government forces Sunday . An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu , Somalia , on Saturday . Jowhar is a major town 55 miles -LRB- 88 kilometers -RRB- southeast of Mogadishu , the capital . `` All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets , '' a local journalist said . The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government , which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu . Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union , which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006 . The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network , and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006 . After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday , the rebels started conducting `` search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town , '' the journalist added . The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town , where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces , said the journalist , who requested anonymity for safety reasons . The town 's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia 's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia , which has waged days-long attacks in the capital . In the latest round of violence , one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday . Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded , Somali officials said Friday . The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991 . Last week , a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters . `` It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government , '' said Sheikh Hassan Ya ` qub , a spokesman for Al-Shabab . `` There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us . '' The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia , or Islamic law , the spokesman said . Somalia 's new president , Sheikh Sharif Ahmed , recently approved implementing sharia , but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form . Meanwhile , a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government . The warlord , Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade , was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys , who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist .",How many were killed and wounded ?,one person was killed and 15 others
898,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the election of the next president a year away , Sen. Hillary Clinton remains the person to beat , a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday suggests . As the countdown begins to November 4 , 2008 , the New York Democrat continues to dominate the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the GOP front-runner , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani . But Clinton 's path to the White House is in no way certain . Clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week , and her rivals for the Democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on Iraq , Iran and other major issues . The Republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the Democratic front-runner , with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping Clinton . The attacks may be working . The CNN/Opinion Research polls suggests that Clinton 's support has slipped from its height one month ago . Watch CNN 's Bill Schneider on the latest poll numbers '' `` Clinton 's strength is about where it was throughout the summer , indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that Obama has not yet cut into her core constituency , '' CNN political director Keating Holland said . Clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely Democratic voters interviewed for the poll . Her closest rival , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , was the top choice of 25 percent , and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has 14 percent . All other Democratic candidates were in single digits . New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was backed by 4 percent , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware by 3 percent , Sen. Christopher Dodd by 2 percent , Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich by 2 percent and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was at 1 percent . The poll involved 467 interviews conducted on November 2-4 with Democrats or independents who lean Democratic . The poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . View the poll results '' In an October CNN/Opinion Research poll , Clinton was supported by 51 percent of Democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over Obama . During last week 's Democratic debate , Clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow Democratic presidential rivals , who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the Iowa Caucus in early January . Edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate , criticizing Clinton for her stance on Iraq , Iran and Social Security . `` The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth and wo n't say one thing one time and something different at a different time , '' Edwards said . Edwards has also accused Clinton of being a `` corporate Democrat '' too willing to defend a `` corrupt '' Washington establishement . `` We desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in Washington that 's become broken , corruption has crept into it , and we have to tell the truth about that , '' Edwards said Monday . `` If you defend that system , I do n't believe you can bring about the change that America needs . '' In the Republican presidential race , Giuliani continues to be the leading candidate , with the backing of 28 percent of the Republican primary voters polled . Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee was backed by 19 percent . Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the top pick of 16 percent , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had 11 percent . Of the remaining Republican candidates , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received 10 percent , Texas Rep. Ron Paul 5 percent , California Rep. Duncan Hunter 4 percent and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo 3 percent . The poll involved telephone interviews with 397 Republicans or independents who lean Republican . The poll 's margin of error was 5 percentage points . In a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners , Clinton leads Giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent . That lead has increased since October , when Clinton led Giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent . `` The overall political environment seems to favor the Democrats , partly because Democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood , which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party , '' Holland said . Only 42 percent of Americans think things are going well , while 58 percent think things are going badly , the poll found . `` The public is not just pessimistic about the country -- Americans are angry , '' Holland said . `` More than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country . '' Clinton 's lead over Giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances , the poll found . In a three-way race , Clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters , Giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent . The poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent . `` My analysis of it is that -LSB- a third-party candidate -RSB- is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me , '' Giuliani said . `` You know it is a tactic , and a legitimate one .

900,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In their first head-to-head debate , Sen. John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama as a candidate who `` does n't understand '' the key issues the country faces , and Obama linked McCain to President Bush on several issues . `` I 'm afraid Sen. Obama does n't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy , '' McCain said Friday as the two traded jabs over Iraq . Obama shot back , `` I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy . And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there . '' McCain drew from his experience overseas as he tried to portray himself as the more qualified candidate . `` Incredibly , incredibly Sen. Obama did n't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with Gen. -LSB- David -RSB- Petraeus , '' he said . Watch McCain , Obama talk about fighting in Iraq '' McCain slammed Obama for not supporting the surge , an increase of about 30,000 troops to Iraq in early 2007 . Bush sent the additional troops as part of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces . `` John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 , '' Obama shot back . `` You talk about the surge . The war started in 2003 , and at the time when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy . You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were . You were wrong . '' Watch entire debate : Part 1 '' | Part 2 '' | Part 3 '' Obama repeatedly criticized the Bush administration and charged that McCain is an endorser of his policies . See scenes from the debate '' In describing his tax plan , Obama said , `` over time , that , I think , is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow . '' Obama also said the economic crisis is the `` final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush , supported by Sen. McCain . '' Both candidates squeezed in a few cheap shots . Obama brought up McCain 's jokingly singing a line about bombing Iran , and McCain jabbed Obama for his short-lived `` presidential seal . '' Immediately after the debate , both campaigns issued statements declaring their candidate the winner . Grade the candidates ' performance in the debate `` This was a clear victory for Barack Obama on John McCain 's home turf . Sen. McCain offered nothing but more of the same failed Bush policies , and Barack Obama made a forceful case for change in our economy and our foreign policy , '' said Obama-Biden campaign manager David Plouffe . `` John McCain needed a game-changer tonight , and by any measure , he did n't get it , '' he said . iReport.com : Who do you think won the debate ? McCain 's campaign said `` there was one man who was presidential tonight ; that man was John McCain . '' `` There was another who was political ; that was Barack Obama . John McCain won this debate and controlled the dialogue throughout , whether it was the economy , taxes , spending , Iraq or Iran . There was a leadership gap , a judgment gap and a boldness gap on display tonight , a fact Barack Obama acknowledged when he said John McCain was right at least five times , '' communications director Jill Hazelbaker said . Full coverage of the debates During the first 30 minutes of the debate , the candidates focused on the economy , even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy . For a while , it seemed like the debate might not even take place , because McCain said he would not show up unless Congress came to an agreement on the government 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan . McCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate , even though Congress has not made a deal . Here 's a snapshot of what the candidates said . On government spending : McCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense , veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending . Obama disagreed , saying , `` The problem is , you 're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel . `` There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded , '' Obama said . He agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas , but he said other areas , such as early childhood education , need more funding . McCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks . Watch the candidates spar over earmarks '' Obama said the country `` absolutely '' needs earmark reform but said , `` the fact is , eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track . '' On the bailout proposal : Obama said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . McCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis . Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $ 700 billion plan proposed by President Bush 's top economic advisers , saying the final details of the proposal were not known . McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it . On the likelihood of another terrorist attack : McCain that another attack on the scale of the September 11 hijackings is `` much less likely '' now than it was the day after the terrorist attacks . `` America is safer now than it was on 9/11 , '' he said , `` But we have a long way to go before we can declare America safe . '' Obama agreed that the United States is `` safer in some ways '' but said the country needed to focus more on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and restoring America 's image in the world . On relations with Russia : Obama called for a re-evaluation of the United States ' approach to Russia in light of the country 's recent military action in the Caucasus . `` You can not be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship , '' he said . McCain accused Obama of responding naively to Russia 's invasion of neighboring Georgia last month by calling on both sides to exercise restraint . McCain said he would support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in NATO . On Iran : McCain said Iranian nuclear weapons would be an `` existential threat to the state of Israel '' and would encourage other countries in the Middle East to seek nuclear weapons as well . `` We can not allow another Holocaust , '' he said . Obama agreed that the United States `` can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , '' calling for tougher sanctions from a range of countries including Russia and China . McCain called for a new `` league of democracies '' to stand firm against Iran . On Iraq : McCain said the next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind . The Republican candidate said that the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning , thanks to a `` great general and a strategy that succeeded . '' `` Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq , '' McCain said . Obama responded , `` that 's not true ; that 's not true . '' He blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start , saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country . Watch Obama tell McCain he was ` wrong ' '' `` At the time when the war started , you said it was quick and easy .

901,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman convicted in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart pleaded guilty in the attempted kidnapping of Smart 's cousin a month later , court officials said Monday . In exchange for Wanda Barzee 's plea of guilty but mentally ill to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping , prosecutors dropped state charges against her in Smart 's abduction , said Nancy Volmer , spokeswoman for Utah state courts . Barzee , 64 , pleaded guilty in November to federal charges of kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in connection with Smart 's abduction . As part of that plea agreement , she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband , Brian David Mitchell , federal prosecutors have said . Barzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart , then 14 , at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family 's Salt Lake City home in June 2002 . Smart was found nine months later , walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy , Utah , in the company of Barzee and Mitchell , a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts ' home . The month after Smart was kidnapped , prosecutors alleged , Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin , but were unsuccessful . The girl was 15 years old at the time , according to CNN affiliate KSL . She is not named in court documents . `` Mr. Mitchell 's attempt was thwarted when the minor child awakened , which caused Mr. Mitchell to flee , '' the court documents said . Following her arrest in 2003 , Barzee told authorities that she and Mitchell went to the home in order to abduct the girl , and planned to hold her , along with Smart , in the couple 's camp in the mountains , according to court documents . Sentencing is set for May 21 on the state charge , Volmer said . Barzee faces between one and 15 years in prison , but prosecutors have agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with her federal sentence , according to court documents . Federal prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison for her in exchange for her cooperation against Mitchell . Federal sentencing was set for May 19 , but a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors has said a sentence would not be imposed until Barzee 's cooperation against Mitchell is complete . At the hearing in federal court , Barzee apologized to Smart , according to a transcript . `` I 'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it , '' she said . `` I 'm so sorry , Elizabeth , for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family . It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day . '' Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell 's . After years of being declared incompetent , she recently was declared competent to stand trial , according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper . A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated , and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple , the Tribune said . At a competency hearing for Mitchell in October , Smart , now 21 , testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California . Just after her abduction , Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her , she said . During the nine months of her captivity , Smart testified , no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell . U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball has not yet ruled on Mitchell 's competency . State court proceedings are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case .

Authorities say a sting targeted a smuggling ring pushing counterfeit goods through a New Jersey port . The defendants were expected to appear Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas . The counterfeit goods included designer jeans , Nike shoes , Burberry and Chanel handbags , and Polo and Baby Phat clothing , according to a news release from the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York . The estimated value of the genuine versions of the goods would be more than $ 200 million , prompting U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia to describe the case as `` one of the largest counterfeit smuggling cases ever brought in United States history . '' The suspects arrested Wednesday are accused of smuggling or attempting to smuggle scores of 40-foot-long shipping containers through the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Elizabeth , New Jersey , since June 2006 . The Chinese-made knockoffs were placed in containers with false bills of lading , which are the shipping documents used to determine a cargo 's point of origin and destination . `` One bill of lading claimed a container held ` noodles , ' when in fact it contained counterfeit Nike sneakers , '' the news release said . After the bogus goods cleared inspection at the New Jersey port , they were transported to New York-area warehouses , where they awaited distribution to retail customers . According to the news release , the bribes were paid directly to an undercover agent whose `` near-daily '' conversations with the suspects were secretly recorded or monitored . The undercover agent posed as a `` corrupt longshoreman 's union official , stationed at Port Newark , who had the ability to clear imported cargo through the United States customs and border security measures without detection or seizure , '' the news release said . The 10 suspects are charged with conspiring to smuggle goods into the U.S. , smuggling goods into the U.S. and trafficking in counterfeit goods , the news release states . If convicted , they face up to 35 years in prison , at least $ 2.5 million in fines and an obligation to pay restitution to the manufacturers of the genuine versions of the goods .

Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout , spokesman Arturo Sandoval said . At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez 's dad , Sandoval said . The father , Raul Ramirez Alvarado , 35 , died in the driver 's seat . The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle , but was apparently shot in the back , Sandoval said . The boy 's body fell forward in front of the vehicle . The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday . No arrests had been made as of Tuesday , the spokesman said . Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso , Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN . `` It 's a senseless tragedy that we 're trying to come to terms with , '' she said . According to El Paso County records , Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed . The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso , Ayala said . It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district . Raul 's classmates were spared the details of his death , but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy 's passing . Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers , Ayala said . More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez , out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people . A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world . According to statistics from local prosecutors , Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day . The bloodiest month this year has been September , with 476 killings reported . The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso , but as Friday 's shooting showed , the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other . Because of the ongoing investigation , Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father , but added that at least 90 percent of the city 's homicides are drug-related . Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year .

Roberto Micheletti and his supporters say Honduras underwent a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup . De facto President Roberto Micheletti and 14 supreme court judges had their visas revoked , said Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez . Lopez said he , too , lost his visa privileges . The U.S. State Department recently announced that it would pull the visas of members of Honduras ' de facto regime . In recent weeks , the United States has stepped up its call for the current Honduran government to restore ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power . Zelaya was seized by the Honduran military in his pajamas and sent into exile on June 28 . On Wednesday , the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation , a U.S. government agency , voted to cut $ 11 million in aid to the government in Honduras , senior State Department officials told CNN . Prior to the vote , the board had only suspended the aid , the State Department said . The Millennium Challenge Account is a program started under the Bush administration to reward good governance . The agency 's cuts followed an announcement last week by the United States that it was terminating all nonhumanitarian aid to Honduras to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of an agreement known as the San Jose Accord . The accord calls for Zelaya 's return to power . The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya 's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits . The country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal . Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup . The United Nations has condemned Zelaya 's ouster and does not recognize Michiletti 's government . While the United States has called Zelaya 's ouster a coup , it has not formally designated it a `` military coup , '' which , under U.S. law , would have triggered a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid regardless . Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution . A presidential campaign in Honduras kicked off last week . However , the United States said it would not support the outcome of the elections unless Zelaya was restored to power .

909,"-LRB- CNN Student News -RRB- -- On November 11 , Americans pay tribute to everyone who has served in the U.S. military . But why was this particular date chosen , and how does this holiday differ from Memorial Day ? Origins of Veterans Day World War I , also known as `` The Great War , '' was fought from 1914 to 1918 . During this conflict , Great Britain , France , Russia , Belgium , Italy , Japan , the United States and other countries , which formed the `` Allies , '' defeated the so-called `` Central Powers , '' which included Germany , Austria-Hungary , Turkey -LRB- then the Ottoman Empire -RRB- and Bulgaria . On the `` eleventh hour , of the eleventh day , of the eleventh month '' of 1918 , German leaders signed an armistice , or a halt to hostilities , with the Allied powers . On that date , November 11 , celebrations were held in New York City , Paris , London and in other cities around the globe . The following year , President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as `` Armistice Day , '' a day to observe the end of World War I. On June 4 , 1926 , the U.S. Congress passed a resolution asking President Calvin Coolidge to call upon officials to `` display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches , or other suitable places , with appropriate ceremonies of friendly relations with all other peoples . '' Twelve years later , on May 13 , 1938 , Congress passed an Act making the 11th of November Armistice Day , a federal holiday . Initially , Armistice Day was supposed to honor veterans of World War I . But after the call to arms and human sacrifices during World War II and the Korean conflict , veterans ' groups urged Congress to consider a day to celebrate U.S. veterans of all wars . On June 1 , 1954 , President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day . Difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day Veterans Day in the United States is a day to honor all Americans who have served in the U.S. military , both during wartime and in peace . Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring Americans who have died serving the nation , especially those who died in battle or from wounds received during armed conflicts . On Veterans Day , Americans thank the living veterans for their service to the country and recognize all who have served the country . Veterans Day Proclamation The following is the text of President George W. Bush 's 2008 Veterans Day Proclamation : On Veterans Day , we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the United States . From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia , from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan , brave patriots have protected our Nation 's ideals , rescued millions from tyranny , and helped spread freedom around the globe . America 's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants , terrorists , and militaries the world has ever known . They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for freedom in human history . Members of the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marines , and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped secure America at every turn . Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and exemplary service . We also remember and honor those who laid down their lives in freedom 's defense . These brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice for our benefit . On Veterans Day , we remember these heroes for their valor , their loyalty , and their dedication . Their selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom around the world . With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world , the Congress has provided -LRB- 5 U.S.C. 6103 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America 's veterans . NOW , THEREFORE , I , GEORGE W. BUSH , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim November 11 , 2008 , as Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15 , 2008 , as National Veterans Awareness Week . I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers . I call upon Federal , State , and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities in their communities . I invite civic and fraternal organizations , places of worship , schools , businesses , unions , and the media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions and programs .

910,"Naoma , West Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- West Virginia 's governor on Tuesday named a former head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to lead a state investigation into last week 's coal mine explosion that left 29 miners dead . Davitt McAteer has overseen investigations into two previous mine accidents , the Sago disaster that killed 12 miners in 2006 and the fire at the Aracoma Alma No. 2 mine that left two workers dead . The West Virginia native served as the Clinton administration 's assistant labor secretary for mine safety in the 1990s and is vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University . `` Davitt has the experience and knowledge to lead what will be a complex and extensive investigation into this horrible accident , '' Gov. Joe Manchin said in announcing McAteer 's appointment . `` We made tremendous progress in 2006 immediately following the Sago and Aracoma accidents , and I fully expect that we will learn even more from this and make dramatic changes to protect our miners . '' The last bodies were recovered early Tuesday from the Upper Big Branch mine , the scene of the fatal explosion April 5 . McAteer was critical of the mine 's owner , Virginia-based Massey Energy , in the days after the blast . `` Some companies , and this appears to be one , take the approach that these violations are simply a cost of doing business -- it 's cheaper for us to mine in an unsafe way or in a way that risks people 's lives than it is for us to comply with the statutes , comply with the laws , '' McAteer said last week . There was no immediate response from Massey Energy to McAteer 's appointment , but Massey CEO Don Blankenship said last week that its safety history is among the best in the industry . The Montcoal , West Virginia , mine received 458 citations from federal inspectors in 2009 , and more than 50 of those were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected , according to federal mine safety records . Inspectors cited the operators more than 100 times in the first quarter of 2010 , including six times for `` unwarrantable failure '' to correct violations . Massey subsidiary Aracoma Coal pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges and paid a record $ 4.2 million in fines and civil penalties in connection with the January 2006 fire that McAteer investigated . Manchin said the state owes an explanation for last week 's disaster to the families of the men who died in the Upper Big Branch mine , `` And we owe it to them and every coal miner working today to do everything humanly possible to prevent this from happening again . '' Managers of two pension funds have called on Massey 's board to oust Blankenship , who has been critical of mining regulations in the past . `` Massey 's cavalier attitude toward risk and callous disregard for the safety of its employees has exacted a horrible cost on dozens of hard-working miners and their loved ones , '' New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a written statement Monday . He said Blankenship `` must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at Massey . '' New York 's state pension fund , which DiNapoli manages , has about $ 14 million worth of Massey stock -- a tiny fraction of the company 's estimated $ 4.3 billion market capitalization . But his call was echoed by the CtW Investment Group , which manages pension funds for about 6 million union workers . CtW blamed Blankenship 's `` confrontational approach to regulatory compliance '' and the failure of the company 's board of directors to challenge him for the disaster . `` Under Chairman and CEO Blankenship 's domineering leadership , Massey Energy placed short-term production and profit goals ahead of prudent risk management , with devastating consequences for the corporation , its shareholders and employees , '' the fund wrote in a letter to the board . `` In light of these consequences , the urgent need for new leadership is apparent . '' The company has not commented on calls for Blankeship 's ouster , but said safety `` has been and will continue to be our top priority every day . '' `` We do not condone any violation of Mine Safety and Health Administration regulations , and we strive to be in compliance with all regulations at all times , '' it said in a written statement last week . Bodies of the remaining victims were removed overnight , said Jama Jarrett , spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners ' Health , Safety and Training . The bodies of seven victims had been recovered shortly after the explosion , and 13 bodies were removed Sunday . Until Sunday , U.S. flags on all federal buildings in the state will be kept at half-staff per a proclamation that President Obama signed on Monday . The mining disaster was the worst in the United States since 1972 , when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg , Idaho .

911,"BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The top court in Iraq sentenced two of Saddam Hussein 's half-brothers to death Wednesday for crimes against humanity . Tariq Aziz , seen in 2002 , was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in jail for crimes against humanity . The court also sentenced former Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and a former senior official known as `` Chemical Ali '' -- Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- to 15 years in custody for crimes against humanity , an official with the Iraq High Tribunal told CNN .

In an unrelated trial last week , Al-Majeed was sentenced to death for his role in putting down an uprising in Baghdad a decade ago , Iraqi state TV reported . It was the third death sentence for al-Majeed , a cousin of Hussein , the former dictator of Iraq who was toppled from power by the U.S.-led coalition in 2003 . Al-Majeed and other former members of Hussein 's regime remain in U.S. custody . His execution has been delayed for political rather than legal reasons . In last week 's trial , Aziz was acquitted . Aziz , one of the best-known faces of the Hussein regime , was Iraq 's deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and also served as minister of foreign affairs for part of that time . He was captured by U.S. forces in April 2003 , shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq . Meanwhile , car bombs in the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul and Kirkuk killed six people on Wednesday , officials told CNN . The Mosul car bomb , which targeted troops , killed four people and wounded 14 others , an Interior Ministry official said .

913,"-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Vick turned himself in to authorities on Monday to get a head start on serving his sentence for running a dogfighting ring , the U.S. Marshals Service said . Michael Vick leaves court in Richmond , Virginia , in August after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges . The Atlanta Falcons quarterback is scheduled to be sentenced on December 10 on a federal conspiracy charge of bankrolling the dogfighting operation . Vick , 27 , voluntarily turned himself in around noon , said Kevin Trevillan of the Marshals Service , and is being held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw , Virginia , until the sentencing hearing . The quarterback , who has been suspended indefinitely by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , faces 12 to 18 months in prison on the charge . Vick pleaded guilty in August after three associates admitted their own roles in the operation and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors . `` From the beginning , Mr. Vick has accepted responsibility for his actions and his self-surrender further demonstrates that acceptance , '' Vick 's attorney , Billy Martin , said in a statement . '' Michael wants to again apologize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time , '' Martin 's statement said . CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin speculated that Vick started his sentence early `` to get it out of the way . '' Watch Toobin explain why Vick would surrender early '' On September 25 , a Virginia grand jury indicted Vick and the three co-defendants -- Purnell Peace , 35 , of Virginia Beach , Virginia ; Quanis Phillips , 28 , of Atlanta , Georgia ; and Tony Taylor , 34 , of Hampton , Virginia -- on state charges of running a dogfighting ring at Vick 's home outside Newport News . The Surry County grand jury brought two charges against the four men : one count of unlawfully torturing and killing dogs and one of promoting dogfights . Each is a felony charge that could result in a five-year prison term . In addition , Taylor faces three additional counts of unlawful torture and killing of dogs . A hearing in that case is set for November 27 , but Vick does not have to be in court at that time . In September , Vick was put under tight restrictions by the federal court after he tested positive for marijuana use . Vick tested positive for the drug on September 13 , a court document from the Eastern District of Virginia shows . As a result , U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson ordered Vick to `` submit to any method of testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer for determining whether the defendant is using a prohibited substance . '' Those methods could include random drug testing , a remote alcohol testing system `` and/or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing , '' the order said . Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , `` or as directed by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer , '' the order said . He was to be electronically monitored during that time . Vick must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling `` if deemed advisable by the pretrial services officer or supervising officer '' at his own expense , the order said .

914,"WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In their first head-to-head debate , Sen. John McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama as a candidate who `` does n't understand '' the key issues the country faces , and Obama linked McCain to President Bush on several issues . `` I 'm afraid Sen. Obama does n't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy , '' McCain said Friday as the two traded jabs over Iraq . Obama shot back , '' I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy . And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there . '' McCain drew from his experience overseas as he tried to portray himself as the more qualified candidate . `` Incredibly , incredibly Sen. Obama did n't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with Gen. -LSB- David -RSB- Petraeus , '' he said . Watch McCain , Obama talk about fighting in Iraq '' McCain slammed Obama for not supporting the surge , an increase of about 30,000 troops to Iraq in early 2007 . Bush sent the additional troops as part of a campaign to pacify Baghdad and its surrounding provinces . `` John , you like to pretend like the war started in 2007 , '' Obama shot back . `` You talk about the surge . The war started in 2003 , and at the time when the war started , you said it was going to be quick and easy . You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were . You were wrong . '' Watch entire debate : Part 1 '' | Part 2 '' | Part 3 '' Obama repeatedly criticized the Bush administration and charged that McCain is an endorser of his policies . See scenes from the debate '' In describing his tax plan , Obama said , `` over time , that , I think , is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow . '' Obama also said the economic crisis is the `` final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush , supported by Sen. McCain . '' Both candidates squeezed in a few cheap shots . Obama brought up McCain 's jokingly singing a line about bombing Iran , and McCain jabbed Obama for his short-lived `` presidential seal . '' Immediately after the debate , both campaigns issued statements declaring their candidate the winner . Grade the candidates ' performance in the debate `` This was a clear victory for Barack Obama on John McCain 's home turf . Sen. McCain offered nothing but more of the same failed Bush policies , and Barack Obama made a forceful case for change in our economy and our foreign policy , '' said Obama-Biden campaign manager David Plouffe . `` John McCain needed a game-changer tonight , and by any measure , he did n't get it , '' he said . iReport.com : Who do you think won the debate ? McCain 's campaign said `` there was one man who was presidential tonight ; that man was John McCain . '' `` There was another who was political ; that was Barack Obama . John McCain won this debate and controlled the dialogue throughout , whether it was the economy , taxes , spending , Iraq or Iran . There was a leadership gap , a judgment gap and a boldness gap on display tonight , a fact Barack Obama acknowledged when he said John McCain was right at least five times , '' communications director Jill Hazelbaker said . Full coverage of the debates During the first 30 minutes of the debate , the candidates focused on the economy , even though the debate was supposed to be centered on foreign policy . For a while , it seemed like the debate might not even take place , because McCain said he would not show up unless Congress came to an agreement on the government 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan . McCain said Friday that enough progress has been made for him to attend the debate , even though Congress has not made a deal . Here 's a snapshot of what the candidates said . On government spending : McCain said he would consider a spending freeze on everything but defense , veterans affairs and entitlement programs in order to cut back on government spending . Obama disagreed , saying , `` The problem is , you 're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel . `` There are some programs that are very important that are currently underfunded , '' Obama said . He agreed that the government needs to cut spending in some areas , but he said other areas , such as early childhood education , need more funding . McCain repeated his call to veto every bill with earmarks . Watch the candidates spar over earmarks '' Obama said the country `` absolutely '' needs earmark reform but said , `` the fact is , eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we are going to get the middle class back on track . '' On the bailout proposal : Obama said that the United States was facing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression . McCain said he was encouraged that Republicans and Democrats were working together to solve the crisis . Obama refused to be pinned down on whether he would support a $ 700 billion plan proposed by President Bush 's top economic advisers , saying the final details of the proposal were not known . McCain said he hoped to be able to vote for it . On the likelihood of another terrorist attack : McCain that another attack on the scale of the September 11 hijackings is `` much less likely '' now than it was the day after the terrorist attacks . `` America is safer now than it was on 9/11 , '' he said , `` But we have a long way to go before we can declare America safe . '' Obama agreed that the United States is `` safer in some ways '' but said the country needed to focus more on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and restoring America 's image in the world . On relations with Russia : Obama called for a re-evaluation of the United States ' approach to Russia in light of the country 's recent military action in the Caucasus . `` You can not be a 21st-century superpower and act like a 20th-century dictatorship , '' he said . McCain accused Obama of responding naively to Russia 's invasion of neighboring Georgia last month by calling on both sides to exercise restraint . McCain said he would support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in NATO . On Iran : McCain said Iranian nuclear weapons would be an `` existential threat to the state of Israel '' and would encourage other countries in the Middle East to seek nuclear weapons as well . `` We can not allow another Holocaust , '' he said . Obama agreed that the United States `` can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , '' calling for tougher sanctions from a range of countries including Russia and China . McCain called for a new `` league of democracies '' to stand firm against Iran . On Iraq : McCain said the next president will have to decide when and how to leave Iraq and what the United States will leave behind . The Republican candidate said that the war had been badly managed at the beginning but that the United States was now winning , thanks to a `` great general and a strategy that succeeded . '' `` Sen. Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq , '' McCain said . Obama responded , `` that 's not true ; that 's not true . '' He blasted McCain as having been wrong about the war at the start , saying McCain had failed to anticipate the uprising against U.S. forces and violence between rival religious groups in the country . Watch Obama tell McCain he was ` wrong ' '' `` At the time when the war started , you said it was quick and easy . You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were , '' Obama said , citing the key White House policy justifying the 2003 invasion . `` You were wrong . You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators . You were wrong , '' he said .",What did Obama say about McCain ?,I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy .

915,"-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- The conventional wisdom , among most folks , anyway , is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity , by those on a budget -- that is , people who want , or need , to `` move down '' from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach . Bottom line , the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury , quality and long-term dependability . However , there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income : used luxury cars . For some buyers , the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus , Lincoln , Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted , without laying out $ 70,000 or $ 80,000 for something you 're not actually going to live in . For others , scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth . At this point , some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions . Recently , Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars , and divvied them up by price range . Using CR 's recommendations as a guideline , here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $ 24,000-30 ,000 price range . 2005 & 2006 Acura MDX A luxury SUV , the MDX is spacious , seats seven , and boasts distinctive styling and Acura 's famed attention to detail . Plus , it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter , 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission . AOL Autos : Used Acura Priced just right as a new vehicle , it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags , three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions . 2007 Acura RDX A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess , the '07 RDX offered unibody construction , leather upholstery , heated front seats , power moonroof , 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires , xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel , and the patented SH-AWD -LRB- SH for Super Handling -RRB- system . 2006 & 2007 Acura TL A mid-size , front-wheel-drive , four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6 , the Acura TL is a fine road machine . Actually , it was available for ' 06 - '07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine , a 286-hp 3.5-liter . Depending on trim level , you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel . 2007 Audi A3 Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics , and that is evident here , in a sharply-engineered , handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride , nimble handling and zesty performance . This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in ' 07 , and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox . AOL Autos : Used Audi 2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars , but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family : The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible ; the '06 325i RWD sedan ; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4 . Depending on the model year and version , the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L . AOL Autos : Used BMW 2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35 Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years , the FX35 is one of the sportier editions . During these model years , the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission . Rear-wheel-drive was standard , but AWD was also an option . Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces , 18-inch wheels , dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls . AOL Autos : Used Infiniti Infiniti G35 The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road , offering Infiniti 's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude . Yes , it has four doors , but it handles like a sporty coupe , with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6 . Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual . Luxo amenities include leather upholstery , automatic climate control , steering wheel audio controls , illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge -LRB- HID -RRB- xenon headlamps . Lexus Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed , high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market , and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models , to the ' 03 - '04 GX edition , '03 LS , '04 / '06 IS entries , ' 04 - '05 RX model , '05 GS and '06 ES to ... well , you get the picture .

And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities . AOL Autos : Used Lexus 2007 Lincoln MKX This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator , and made a big splash .

One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the `` Vista Roof . '' 2007 Lincoln MKZ Also new for the '07 model year , this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr . Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission . FWD is standard , but AWD is optional . Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front ; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions ; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution . 2007 Lincoln Town Car A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back , the Town Car still `` has game '' -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s . It 's still cavernous inside , but now boasts a much more refined design . It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that 's linked to a four-speed automatic . The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques . Available in Signature , Signature Limited , Designer and Signature L trim levels , you can find one to fit any taste . 1998 Porsche 911 No , your eyes do n't deceive you -- CR did include a primo , high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $ 30,000 . But , take note : This is the 1998 edition . But when you 're dealing with quality of this level , even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it . So , by `` going vintage , '' driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank . In ' 98 , the 911 was powered by a 3.6 L H-6 282 hp engine . So , while it was n't quite the road-burner it is today , is still packed plenty of thrust . 2007 Volvo S60 -LRB- FWD -RRB- Only a year old , the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition , and it boasts top-drawer performance , stylish design and Volvo 's all-world safety features . The '07 S60 came in several trim levels , with an array of engine sizes , from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies . Depending on the trim line , either a manual or automatic transmission can be had . 2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70 The XC70 is a crossover vehicle , splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon . And it 's one of the finest crossovers on the road . It 's all-wheel drive , and the latest used-model-year , the ' 07 , was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection .",What is the price of the 1998 Porsche 911 ?,"under $ 30,000"
917,"London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes , whom officers shot dead in 2005 , mistaking him for a suicide bomber . The police offered `` a further unreserved apology '' for the death of de Menezes in 2005 , plus an undisclosed compensation package , the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement . `` All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved , '' the statement added . De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7 , 2005 . The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations , including one that found police acted illegally . A jury found in 2007 that London 's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting . It did not examine the cause of death . Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him . They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train , which would have given them a reason to shoot . But the coroner at the inquest , who acted as the judge , had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing . They returned an open verdict in the case , meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death . De Menezes ' family called the proceedings a `` whitewash '' because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing . De Menezes was killed July 22 , 2005 , a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system . Two weeks earlier , four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus , killing 52 people and wounding 977 . The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers . Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes , 27 , believing he was one of the suspects . They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station , where they chased him onto the platform and into a train , and shot him dead . The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action . `` We made a most terrible mistake , '' Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time , adding police needed to learn from the incident . `` I am sorry . '' The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair . CNN 's Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report .",What made them think de Menezes was a suicide bomber ?,Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed
918,"ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home , a medical examiner said Tuesday . Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit , who killed his family in June . Dr. Kris Sperry , Georgia 's chief medical examiner , said the body of Benoit 's wife , Nancy , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs . Sperry said it 's likely the Benoits ' 7-year-old son , Daniel , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy 's system . Xanax is not normally prescribed for children , Sperry said . Chris Benoit 's body contained an `` elevated '' level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone , Sperry said . But , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death . `` There 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , '' Sperry said . `` The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , '' he said . `` It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency . '' The investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in Benoit 's body . The investigation into the Benoits ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called '' ` roid rage , '' leading him to kill his wife and son . An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy . The Orlando , Florida , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids . Phil Astin , Benoit 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs . Astin has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest . Although Benoit 's name was not mentioned in Astin 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths . `` Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville , Georgia , Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4 , 2006 , through May 9 , 2007 , '' the U.S. attorney 's office said . Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone . Nancy Benoit 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body `` could come from the decomposition process . '' Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel 's body . Daniel 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but Sperry could not speculate why . District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits ' deaths , which he said is ongoing . `` We 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , '' he said . `` We 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household . This -LRB- the toxicology report -RRB- adds one element to all the other elements . '' Police have said Benoit , 40 , strangled his wife , Nancy , and suffocated Daniel , then placed Bibles next to their bodies before hanging himself on a portable weight machine over the weekend of June 23 .
